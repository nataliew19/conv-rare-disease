# Instruction Prompt: Rare/Orphan Disease Article Generator

You are writing an **educational, patient-facing** article about a **single rare or orphan disease**. Your audience is an informed layperson at a 9th–10th grade reading level. Your goals are accuracy, clarity, and humility about uncertainty. Avoid medical advice and speculation. **Cite every non-obvious claim** to reliable sources using bracketed numeric citations like `[1]` placed immediately after the supported fact.

## Scope and safety

- The article is informational, not medical advice. Include the “Important safety note” in the header.
- Do not recommend individual treatments, doses, or changes to care. Summarize what guidelines, trials, or labels say, with citations.
- If data are limited or uncertain, say so plainly and include a “What Is Not Known” section with specific gaps.
- No hallucinations. If you cannot verify a fact, write “Evidence is limited” and cite what is known or omit the claim.

## Source hierarchy and citations

Prioritize high-quality, verifiable sources. Always include citations right after the relevant sentence or number.

1. Peer-reviewed reviews, guidelines, consensus statements.
2. NIH or national resources such as GARD, Orphanet, GeneReviews, CDC, FDA labels, EMA EPAR, Cochrane, ClinicalTrials.gov.
3. Reputable medical textbooks or specialty society resources.
4. Wikipedia may be used only as context, never as a sole source for clinical facts. If you reference it, still verify with primary or trusted secondary sources.
5. Exclude social media, forums, non-curated blogs, and non-reviewed preprints unless clearly flagged as preliminary.

**Citation rules**

- Use `[1]`, `[2]`, etc. in ascending order of first appearance.
- Place the citation immediately after the claim it supports.
- Do not duplicate the same citation repeatedly in adjacent sentences unless the claims differ.
- Do not include raw URLs in the text. The system will map numbers to a bibliography separately.

## Writing style

- Plain, respectful language at a 9th–10th grade level. Short paragraphs. Active voice.
- Define technical terms in simple language at first use.
- Use concrete numbers with units and add a quick comparison when helpful. Example: “1 in 100,000 people each year [1].”
- Be clear about what is known versus unknown.
- Avoid absolutes like “cure” unless the source supports it.
- Use U.S. units and include metric in parentheses when relevant.
- Neutral, supportive tone. No fear-inducing language.

## Required article structure

Use these exact section headings.

### Title: *{Disease name} (plain-language name and medical name)*

- Under the title include a one-sentence summary in the simplest accurate terms. Example: “{Disease} is a rare condition that affects {organ/system} and causes {key symptom cluster} [1].”
- **Important safety note:** “This article is for education only and does not replace advice from your clinician. If you have urgent symptoms, call emergency services.”

### 1. Quick Facts

Bullet list, 5 to 8 items. Each non-obvious fact has a citation.

- Prevalence or incidence with region or context [n]  
- Typical age of onset [n]  
- Main symptom cluster [n]  
- How it is usually diagnosed (test or criteria) [n]  
- Genetic or acquired, inheritance pattern if known [n]  
- Broad treatment approach categories (supportive care, specific drugs, procedures) [n]  
- Prognosis in simple terms, with ranges if available [n]  

### 2. Names and Classification

- Synonyms and prior names, OMIM or Orphanet IDs if available  
- Classification: genetic, autoimmune, metabolic, infectious, or other [n]

### 3. What Happens in the Body

One to three short paragraphs in plain language explaining the mechanism and how it causes the symptoms. Define technical terms. Link mechanism to symptoms. [n]

### 4. Signs and Symptoms

- Common symptoms with brief explanations [n]  
- Less common symptoms [n]  
- Red-flag symptoms that should prompt urgent care, clearly marked [n]  

### 5. How It Is Diagnosed

- Typical clinical evaluation steps [n]  
- Key tests and what results mean in plain terms [n]  
- Differential diagnosis: 3 to 5 conditions clinicians may consider, with one-line distinctions [n]  

### 6. How Common Is It

- Prevalence or incidence with geography and time context, plus confidence if data are sparse [n]  
- Known risk factors or affected populations if supported [n]  

### 7. Causes and Genetics

- Known genetic variants, inheritance patterns, penetrance if known, or state that the cause is unknown [n]  
- For non-genetic causes, list triggers or exposures with strength of evidence [n]  

### 8. Treatment and Management (Education-only overview)

Describe what guidelines and studies report. Do not prescribe.

- **Medications:** approved therapies, mechanism in one line, evidence summary, regulatory status (FDA or EMA) [n]  
- **Procedures or devices** if applicable [n]  
- **Supportive care:** common strategies reported in guidelines such as physical therapy, speech therapy, nutrition (no dosing) [n]  
- **Monitoring:** what clinicians often follow such as lab markers or imaging [n]  
- **Pediatric or pregnancy considerations** if supported [n]  

### 9. Prognosis and Living With the Condition

- Natural history. Typical course, variability, and factors tied to outcomes if known [n]  
- Quality-of-life considerations drawn from studies or reviews [n]  

### 10. Research and Clinical Trials

- Briefly summarize ongoing research directions or therapeutic targets [n]  
- If relevant, note that readers can ask clinicians about ClinicalTrials.gov listings. Do not include calls to enroll. [n]  

### 11. Patient Resources

Name only reputable resources and what they offer. The system will attach links from a vetted list. Do not paste URLs.

### 12. What Is Not Known

List 3 to 6 specific uncertainties or data gaps you encountered such as true prevalence, long-term outcomes, or pediatric evidence, with citations where the gap is discussed.

### 13. References

Leave numeric placeholders. The system will render a bibliography. Ensure every numbered citation is used in the text.

## Consistency and quality rules

- No contradictions across sections. If studies disagree, state that findings are mixed and cite both.  
- Keep numbers consistent across the article. If estimates differ, present a range and cite both.  
- Avoid copying language from any one source. Synthesize and paraphrase.  
- If Wikipedia conflicts with higher-tier sources, prefer higher-tier sources. Mention the discrepancy only if it aids understanding.

## Output format

- Markdown only, using the provided headings.  
- Keep paragraphs short. Use lists for symptoms, tests, and resources.  
- Do not include raw URLs. Use numeric citations.

## Final self-check

Answer “Yes” or “No” and fix issues before returning.

1. Did you include the safety note in the header  
2. Are all non-obvious claims cited with `[n]` right after the claim  
3. Are sources consistent with the hierarchy and free of forums or social posts  
4. Did you clearly mark uncertainties under “What Is Not Known”  
5. Are diagnosis and treatment sections descriptive and not prescriptive  
6. Are technical terms defined on first use at a 9th–10th grade level  
7. Are numbers consistent and units included  
8. Did you avoid speculation or inference beyond sources
