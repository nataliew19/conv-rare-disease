Orphanet aims to provide high-quality information on rare diseases, and ensure equal access to knowledge for all stakeholders. Orphanet also maintains the Orphanet rare disease nomenclature (ORPHAcode), essential in improving the visibility of rare diseases in health and research information systems. \\nOrphanet was established in France by the INSERM (French National Institute for Health and Medical Research) in 1997. This initiative became a European endeavour from 2000, supported by grants from the European Commission: Orphanet has gradually grown to a Consortium of 40 countries, within Europe and across the globe. \\nOrphaNews is a freely available, twice-monthly electronic newsletter for the rare disease community, presenting an overview of scientific and political news about rare diseases and orphan drugs. \\nThe Orphadata platform provides the scientific community with comprehensive, high-quality datasets related to rare diseases and orphan drugs, in a reusable and computable format. \\nThe Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology (ORDO) is a structured vocabulary for rare diseases derived from the Orphanet database, capturing relationships between diseases, genes and other relevant features. ORDO provides integrated, re-usable data for computational analysis. \\nOrphanet works with the rare disease community in order to provide its users with quality, up-to-date information on rare diseases and to improve its services.\\nContribute to Orphanet scientific data and give your feedback using our interactive community-driven curation platform for experts.\\nImprove the visibility of your activities related to rare diseases by registering them with Orphanet.\\nPartner with Orphanet and support us in our mission to improve knowledge and information on rare diseases.\",\n",

    "\n",
    "> **Reference:** See **Section 4.4 (Synthesis & Report Composition)** in the handout for comprehensive methodology on evidence synthesis and investigative narrative construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "Synthesize your research findings into a comprehensive investigative report using automated DSPy-based processing pipelines that demonstrate advanced research capabilities beyond traditional literature synthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generated Report Structure:\n",
    "1. **Executive Summary:** A concise overview of your key findings and their significance\n",
    "2. **Sections:** Use `#` for primary sections; Use `##` for subsections that organize detailed analysis; etc.\n",
    "3. **Inline Citations:** Use numbered references in square brackets (e.g., `[1]`, `[2]`, `[3]`)\n",
    "4. **Bibliography:** Conclude with a reference section where each line follows the format: `[index]. URL or source description`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Thesis-Specific Literature Search**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using your three generated theses from Action Item 6, conduct targeted literature searches for each thesis. Implement a `LiteratureSearchAgentRequest` with the `guideline` parameter to focus searches on supporting evidence for each specific thesis. Set `with_synthesis=False` to collect raw `rag_responses` for later processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Key Insight Identification**\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a `KeyInsightIdentifier` DSPy signature to automatically extract the most important insight from each RAG response. This reduces noise and focuses on essential information for report composition. The key insight should be a concise, one-sentence summary capturing the most relevant information for each question-answer pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Report Structure and Guideline Generation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a `FinalWritingGuidelineProposal` DSPy signature that uses the collected key insights to:\n",
    "- Generate a unified report thesis that synthesizes your investigative findings\n",
    "- Propose a structured writing guideline in bullet-point format outlining key sections and content organization\n",
    "- Ensure logical flow from background through specific discoveries to implications\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Automated Report Synthesis**\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a `FinalReportSynthesizer` DSPy signature that combines the report thesis, writing guidelines, and all collected evidence into a coherent investigative report. The synthesizer should:\n",
    "- Merge relevant information into logically coherent narrative sections\n",
    "- Preserve all original citations exactly as provided\n",
    "- Eliminate redundancy while maintaining completeness\n",
    "- Create smooth transitions between thematic sections\n",
    "- Constrain content to provided information without external speculation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quality Standards:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your final report should demonstrate investigative depth by presenting original analytical insights not readily available in existing literature, comprehensive coverage through automated integration of evidence from multiple search iterations, logical organization with clear progression from initial questions to final conclusions, and proper attribution through systematic citation preservation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The completed report should read as a coherent investigative piece rather than a collection of separate research summaries, showcasing the power of automated synthesis in building compelling investigative narratives from distributed evidence sources.\n",

    "    CORE GOAL:\n",
    "    - Produce a markdown article that follows the guideline's section order.\n",
    "    - Make it clear, accurate, and explicit about uncertainties.\n",
    "    - Do NOT give medical advice; describe current knowledge only.\n",

    "    STRUCTURE RULES:\n",
    "    - Start with the provided title as an H1 (# ...).\n",
    "    - Immediately follow with the education/safety note:\n",
    "      \"This article is for education only and does not replace advice from your clinician.\"\n",

    "    - Use markdown headings (#, ##, ###) to reflect hierarchy.\n",

    "    CONTENT INTEGRATION RULES:\n",
    "    - Merge all relevant RAG answers into the correct sections; do not leave content floating.\n",
    "    - If multiple RAG items repeat the same fact, keep the clearest one.\n",
    "    - If RAG indicates limited evidence, state that explicitly in the \"What Is Not Known\"/limitations section.\n",
    "    - Do NOT introduce information that is not present in `gathered_information` or obviously implied by the selected theses/guideline.\n",
    "\n",
    "    WRITING STYLE:\n",
    "    - Patient-friendly, ~9th–10th grade, but still precise.\n",
    "    - Short paragraphs; use bulleted lists for symptoms, tests, or resources if the guideline suggests it.\n",
    "    - Neutral, non-alarmist tone.\n",
    "    - Do NOT prescribe or recommend doses.\n",

    "    CITATION POLICY (STRICT)\n",

    "           - Only numeric inline citations are allowed: [1], [2], [3], ...\n",
    "           - Do NOT output URLs, domains, or alphanumeric IDs inside brackets (e.g. no [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov], no [FDA-2024], no [Orphanet]).\n",
    "           - If the source text you were given contains non-numeric citations, DROP them unless a numeric ID for the same fact is also present.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        2. Source of truth\n",
    "           - Assume that `gathered_information` has already had its citation numbers normalized by the pipeline.\n",
    "           - You MUST reuse these numeric IDs exactly as they appear in `gathered_information`.\n",
    "           - You MUST NOT invent new numbers or renumber globally.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        3. Where to place citations\n",
    "           - Attach the citation immediately after the fact/number/name it supports.\n",
    "           - Example: “DMD is caused by mutations in the DMD gene on Xp21.2.[1]”\n",
    "           - Not allowed: putting all citations at the end of the paragraph.\n",
    "           - Not allowed: “... Xp21.2 [1].” (space before bracket) → prefer “Xp21.2.[1]”\n",
    "        \n",
    "        4. How many citations per fact\n",
    "           - Default to 1 citation per fact.\n",
    "           - You may use 2 citations only when:\n",
    "             a) the fact combines two distinct claims that both had citations in `gathered_information`, or\n",
    "             b) you are showing that multiple guideline documents agree.\n",
    "           - Maximum allowed at once: 3.\n",
    "           - If the source text had a long chain like [1][2][13][30][31], shorten it to the 1–2 MOST RELEVANT numbers for that sentence.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        5. Conflicting or duplicate citations\n",
    "           - If two sentences in `gathered_information` cite the same number for the same claim, you may keep only the first instance in your synthesized paragraph.\n",
    "           - Do not show the same citation number 3 times in the same paragraph unless the paragraph truly has 3 different claims from that source.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        6. Non-numeric or malformed citations\n",
    "           - If you encounter a citation like “[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov]” or “[FDA page]” in the input:\n",
    "             - Try to find the nearest numeric citation for the same idea in the same input block and use that instead.\n",
    "             - If there is no numeric match, omit that citation completely and keep the sentence only if it is well supported elsewhere in the same paragraph.\n",
    "             - Do NOT output the malformed citation.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        7. Ascending order within a sentence\n",
    "           - If a sentence must keep more than one citation, order them ascending: “[1][5]” not “[5][1]”.\n",
    "           - Do not renumber across the entire document—just sort the ones you are actually using in that spot.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        8. Missing support\n",
    "           - If you cannot find any numeric citation in `gathered_information` that supports a sentence you are writing, REMOVE that sentence instead of inventing a citation.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        9. Section-level claims\n",
    "           - For generic, well-supported section intros that summarize multiple cited sentences in `gathered_information`, use the earliest applicable citation number for that section.\n",
    "           - Example: if all the DMD natural history claims in the inputs use [23], [24], [25], open the prognosis section with “[23]” or “[23][24]”, not with a new number.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        10. No cross-section recycling\n",
    "           - Do not copy a citation number from a therapy paragraph into a genetics paragraph if the original source in `gathered_information` did not talk about genetics.\n",
    "           - Keep citations tied to the topic they originally supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    CONTENT CONSTRAINTS:\n",
    "    - Constrain content to provided information.\n",
    "    - Do not speculate or add external knowledge.\n",
