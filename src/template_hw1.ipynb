Orphanet aims to provide high-quality information on rare diseases, and ensure equal access to knowledge for all stakeholders. Orphanet also maintains the Orphanet rare disease nomenclature (ORPHAcode), essential in improving the visibility of rare diseases in health and research information systems. \\nOrphanet was established in France by the INSERM (French National Institute for Health and Medical Research) in 1997. This initiative became a European endeavour from 2000, supported by grants from the European Commission: Orphanet has gradually grown to a Consortium of 40 countries, within Europe and across the globe. \\nOrphaNews is a freely available, twice-monthly electronic newsletter for the rare disease community, presenting an overview of scientific and political news about rare diseases and orphan drugs. \\nThe Orphadata platform provides the scientific community with comprehensive, high-quality datasets related to rare diseases and orphan drugs, in a reusable and computable format. \\nThe Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology (ORDO) is a structured vocabulary for rare diseases derived from the Orphanet database, capturing relationships between diseases, genes and other relevant features. ORDO provides integrated, re-usable data for computational analysis. \\nOrphanet works with the rare disease community in order to provide its users with quality, up-to-date information on rare diseases and to improve its services.\\nContribute to Orphanet scientific data and give your feedback using our interactive community-driven curation platform for experts.\\nImprove the visibility of your activities related to rare diseases by registering them with Orphanet.\\nPartner with Orphanet and support us in our mission to improve knowledge and information on rare diseases.\",\n",

    "> **Reference:** Section 3.1 emphasizes the importance of evaluating RAG systems across diverse query types to assess robustness and performance characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Test Case A: Recency-Focused Query (`rag_question_recency`)\n",
    "**Objective:** Evaluate the system's capability to retrieve and synthesize recent information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- Formulate a factual question requiring current information for `rag_question_recency` (e.g., \"What are the latest products from Apple in 2025?\")\n",
    "- **Note:** Do not use the provided example; create an original query\n",
    "- Focus on testing temporal information retrieval accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evaluation Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "For this test question, document and analyze:\n",
    "- **Quality of retrieved sources** (`rag_question_recency_quality_comment`, `rag_question_depth_quality_comment`): List all unique URLs from the RAG results one line per URL followed by [yes] or [no, {reason}] to indicate whether the URL is of high quality and should be included and cited when generating the final answer.\n",
    "- **Relevance retrieved information** (`rag_question_recency_relevance_comment`, `rag_question_depth_relevance_comment`): Do all retrieved documents contain information that directly answers the question? Take a look at uncited documents, make comment on whether you think they are irrelevant to the question and thus LLM didn't cited it.\n",
    "- **Comprehensiveness of generated answer** (`rag_question_recency_comprehensiveness_comment`, `rag_question_depth_comprehensiveness_comment`): Does the final answer synthesize information well and provide a complete response? Does LLM fully make use of all retrieved information? What are details that are left not included in the final answer.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "Synthesize your research findings into a comprehensive investigative report using automated DSPy-based processing pipelines that demonstrate advanced research capabilities beyond traditional literature synthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generated Report Structure:\n",
    "1. **Executive Summary:** A concise overview of your key findings and their significance\n",
    "2. **Sections:** Use `#` for primary sections; Use `##` for subsections that organize detailed analysis; etc.\n",
    "3. **Inline Citations:** Use numbered references in square brackets (e.g., `[1]`, `[2]`, `[3]`)\n",
    "4. **Bibliography:** Conclude with a reference section where each line follows the format: `[index]. URL or source description`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Thesis-Specific Literature Search**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using your three generated theses from Action Item 6, conduct targeted literature searches for each thesis. Implement a `LiteratureSearchAgentRequest` with the `guideline` parameter to focus searches on supporting evidence for each specific thesis. Set `with_synthesis=False` to collect raw `rag_responses` for later processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Key Insight Identification**\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a `KeyInsightIdentifier` DSPy signature to automatically extract the most important insight from each RAG response. This reduces noise and focuses on essential information for report composition. The key insight should be a concise, one-sentence summary capturing the most relevant information for each question-answer pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Report Structure and Guideline Generation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a `FinalWritingGuidelineProposal` DSPy signature that uses the collected key insights to:\n",
    "- Generate a unified report thesis that synthesizes your investigative findings\n",
    "- Propose a structured writing guideline in bullet-point format outlining key sections and content organization\n",
    "- Ensure logical flow from background through specific discoveries to implications\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Automated Report Synthesis**\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a `FinalReportSynthesizer` DSPy signature that combines the report thesis, writing guidelines, and all collected evidence into a coherent investigative report. The synthesizer should:\n",
    "- Merge relevant information into logically coherent narrative sections\n",
    "- Preserve all original citations exactly as provided\n",
    "- Eliminate redundancy while maintaining completeness\n",
    "- Create smooth transitions between thematic sections\n",
    "- Constrain content to provided information without external speculation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quality Standards:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your final report should demonstrate investigative depth by presenting original analytical insights not readily available in existing literature, comprehensive coverage through automated integration of evidence from multiple search iterations, logical organization with clear progression from initial questions to final conclusions, and proper attribution through systematic citation preservation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The completed report should read as a coherent investigative piece rather than a collection of separate research summaries, showcasing the power of automated synthesis in building compelling investigative narratives from distributed evidence sources.\n",

      "  - Briefly summarize the claimed broadening of Russian Air Force unmanned operations from 2022–2024, highlighting reference to campaigns in Ukraine and purported transnational theaters.\n",
      "  - Note the emergence of attrition- and disruption-focused warfare and the establishment of Russia’s Unmanned Systems Forces (VBS) as key doctrinal developments [1][2].\n",
      "- Data and Methods\n",
      "  - Identify principal datasets and sources used (Ukrainian Air Force, CSIS, ACLED, ISW, UN, Saratoga Foundation, local Syrian media, SIPRI, Jane’s, etc.).\n",
      "  - Outline methods/coding practices underlying casualty, strike, and theater reporting; note ways drone/missile incidents are counted and geographic assignments are made [1][2][3][4][5][6][8].\n",
      "- Key Findings\n",
      "  - Confirm robust, multi-source evidence of large-scale Russian Air Force remote strike campaigns within Ukraine, with high attack volumes and significant civilian impact [1][2][3][4][5][6][8].\n",
      "  - Document a lack of Tier-1 or primary dataset evidence supporting Russian Air Force drone campaigns in Ar Raqqa, Rural Damascus, or Lattakia, instead finding primary reported activity confined to Ukraine and defensive events near Hmeimim Air Base in Latakia [1][2][3][4][5][6].\n",
      "  - Present the strategic intent articulated by Russian authorities to institutionalize unmanned operations as a new doctrinal pillar, grounded mainly in lessons from the Ukrainian theater [1][2].\n",
      "  - Highlight that the claim of a median fatality per attack of zero in remote strikes is not substantiated by direct event-level evidence in major datasets or reports [acleddata.com][sipri.org][dronewars.github.io].\n",
      "- Limitations\n",
      "  - Explicitly detail core data/coding limitations: reliance on open-source/secondary information, urban and geographic biases, default fatality coding, and component reliability issues impacting Russian drone efficacy [1][2][3][www.csis.org][drones.cnas.org][www.russiamatters.org][ctc.westpoint.edu].\n",
      "  - Emphasize the absence of primary documentation for transnational strike claims and for median-zero fatality assessments.\n",
      "- Implications\n",
      "  - Analyze what verified campaign patterns reveal about Russia’s evolving doctrine, the practical/psychological impacts on civilian societies, and the caution warranted in assessing operational breadth.\n",
      "- Next Steps\n",
      "  - Recommend priority for increased event-level data transparency, expanded cross-regional airpower monitoring, and further scrutiny of doctrinal rhetoric versus operational fact.\n",
