# Background

Claims that the Russian Air Force significantly broadened its unmanned operations between 2022 and 2024 rest primarily on voluminous reporting of large-scale remote strike campaigns inside Ukraine and on public statements by Russian defense authorities about institutional reforms. Open-source operational tallies compiled from Ukrainian reporting and international monitors show sustained high-volume launches against Ukrainian territory, with the Ukrainian Air Force reporting daily tallies and a record 6,443 drones and missiles launched in July 2025 alone[1]. Independent compilations confirm extensive launches across Ukraine including Kyiv and Donetsk, and have been used to construct multi-year dashboards of launches and impacts[2]. Conflict-monitoring datasets and media summaries documented dramatic spikes in Shahed and other loitering-munition attacks during 2024–2025 and associated increases in civilian harm across key regions such as Donetsk and Kyiv[3][4]. Military analysts described Russian tactics in the Ukraine theater as focused on volume, persistence, and disruption—salvo launches of hundreds of munitions intended to overwhelm defenses and damage critical infrastructure[5]. United Nations monitoring also recorded substantial civilian casualties from remote strikes inside Ukraine and attributed major coordinated strike episodes to Russian-launched loitering munitions and missiles[6][7]. At the same time, Russian authorities have signalled a doctrinal shift to elevate unmanned systems as a core service element, with international commentators noting programs to formalize an Unmanned Systems Forces and to extract lessons from the Ukrainian experience[8][9].

# Data and methods

The evidence base for assessing Russian unmanned campaigns is built from layered open-source datasets and organizational reporting. Principal event-level and analytical sources relied on in this review include Ukrainian Air Force tallies and CSIS compilations of launch totals and platform types[2][8]; ACLED event-level coding of explosions and remote-violence incidents with geolocation, actor labels, and conservative fatality coding practices[3][4]; ISW operational analysis and open-source synthesis of salvo sizes, target patterns, and Russian operational statements[5]; and United Nations human-rights monitoring for civilian casualty documentation[6][7]. Media and commercial aggregators such as Statista, major newswires, and national reporting provide complementary time-series and episodic accounts of strikes and societal effects[9][10][11][12][13]. Regional and local reporting (including multilingual Syrian sources) supply event narratives for strikes near major facilities such as Hmeimim Air Base[22][23][24].

These sources employ varied coding practices and methodological choices. ACLED and similar monitors code “Explosions/Remote violence” events and assign fatalities when reported, but where detailed counts are unavailable they follow conservative default coding rules designed to avoid inflation of death tolls[31]. Datasets differ in granularity: some provide daily launch tallies and platform classifications (e.g., CSIS dashboards), others provide incident-level geocoded events with actor attribution and fatality fields (e.g., ACLED), while human-rights monitors focus on verified civilian harm for individual incidents (UN HRMMU). Open-source analytical products such as ISW describe methods that synthesize media reporting, social media, and imagery rather than primary internal documents and explicitly flag the limits of publicly available evidence[5]. Regional media and local monitoring groups add event narratives but vary widely in confirmation standards and geographic precision; when commercial or social-media reporting lacks coordinates, datasets often default to administrative centers or place-name approximations, reducing spatial precision[31][32].

# Key findings

There is robust, multi-source evidence of a sustained, large-scale Russian remote-strike campaign inside Ukraine during 2022–2024 characterized by high launch volumes, repeated attacks on critical infrastructure and population centers, and substantial civilian harm. Ukrainian military tallies and independent compilations document massed launches of one-way attack drones (notably Shahed derivatives) and missiles across Ukraine including Kyiv and Donetsk, producing measurable increases in civilian casualties and infrastructure damage[1][2][3][4][5]. Analytical reporting describes salvo tactics that aim for attrition and disruption through saturation, and notes that loitering munitions have been used to attack industrial, transport, and urban targets with consequential humanitarian effects[5][6][8].

By contrast, the available primary datasets and tier-1 reporting examined here do not substantiate claims of comparable Russian Air Force offensive drone strike campaigns in transnational theaters—specifically Ar Raqqa, rural Damascus, or broad offensive operations across Lattakia—between 2022 and 2024. The open-source record contains no Tier‑1 newswire or primary dataset evidence documenting Russian Air Force-conducted strike campaigns in those Syrian regions with actor-attributed strike counts, dates, and campaign narratives comparable to the Ukrainian record[10][11][12][13][14][15]. Multilingual regional and Syrian local media archives do, however, document hostile drone activity and defensive engagements concentrated around Russia’s Hmeimim (Khmeimim) Air Base in Latakia province, including recorded drone attacks on or near the base and nearby munitions depots and reported downings of individual drones[22][23][24]. Those local reports record attacks affecting Russian facilities and defensive responses, but they do not provide evidence that the Russian Air Force executed outward drone strike campaigns from 2022–2024 across Ar Raqqa, rural Damascus, or Lattakia comparable in scale or doctrinal framing to the Ukraine operations[22][23][24][25][26].

Multiple reputable analyses and organizational reports document explicit doctrinal intent within Russian policy circles to institutionalize unmanned systems as a formal and expanding component of force structure. Independent assessments note the December 2024 announcement and reporting around the establishment of an Unmanned Systems Forces (VBS) and link this institutionalization to lessons drawn from operations in Ukraine, framing unmanned capabilities as a growing strategic priority for modernization, industrial organization, and potential future force posture changes[16][17][18]. These doctrinal statements and organizational reforms indicate a strategic intent to elevate unmanned systems from auxiliary roles toward primary instruments of strike, reconnaissance, and disruption—an intent grounded largely in the operational experience and perceived benefits observed in the Ukrainian theater[16][17][18].

Finally, claims that remote strikes during 2022–2024 had a median fatality per attack of zero are not supported by the incident-level datasets or human-rights reporting surveyed. Event-level monitors and casualty databases do not provide a quoted median-fatality figure of zero for drone or artillery strikes across the conflicts reviewed, and ACLED, SIPRI, and other datasets either do not compute that specific statistic or do not report such a median in their published materials[36][37][38]. Independent civilian-harm monitoring and conflict-specific incident compilations instead document numerous strikes associated with non-zero fatalities in Ukraine, Gaza, Tigray, and other theaters, indicating that remote strikes have repeatedly produced lethal outcomes at the event level in multiple contexts[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][gaza-patterns-harm.airwars.org][ukraine.ohchr.org].

# Limitations and data caveats

Core limitations constrain any assessment of Russian unmanned campaigns in 2022–2024. First, most analyses depend on open-source reporting and secondary data aggregation rather than internal Russian operational records; ISW and other commentators explicitly caveat that their syntheses rely on public media, social-media, and commercial imagery sources and thus face verification limits[5]. Second, monitoring datasets exhibit known spatial and reporting biases: urban events and well-covered locations tend to be over-represented while rural and contested areas are under-reported, and geocoding defaults can misplace events when precise coordinates are absent[31][32]. Third, fatality coding practices introduce conservative biases: ACLED’s practice of assigning default fatalities in the absence of concrete counts and its aggregation rules mean recorded fatality fields are lower-bound estimates in some contexts and are not disaggregated by combatant versus civilian victims except in explicitly labelled civilian-targeting events[31]. Fourth, the heterogeneous mix of drone types—long-range one-way kamikazes, FPV attack quadcopters, and reconnaissance UAS—complicates counting and effectiveness estimates; many datasets focus on larger Shahed-family launches and may undercount small FPV attacks, while production and quality variations due to supply constraints further muddy operational assessments[www.csis.org][drones.cnas.org][www.russiamatters.org][ctc.westpoint.edu]. Fifth, claims about transnational employment of Russian Air Force-launched offensive drones lack primary documentation in the sources reviewed; where drone activity is reported in Syria it is predominantly described either as attacks against Russian bases (defensive/incidental) or as actions attributed to other state actors, not as Russian Air Force outward strike campaigns with quantified sortie and casualty records[22][23][24][25][26].

# Implications

The verifiable pattern—that Russia conducted intense, high-volume remote-strike campaigns within Ukraine while public evidence for comparable offensive transnational Russian Air Force drone campaigns in Syrian theaters is absent—carries multiple implications. Operationally, Russia’s Ukraine-centered employment of loitering munitions and mass-launch tactics appears to be both the laboratory and justification for doctrinal institutionalization of unmanned forces; policy statements and organizational reforms point to an intent to formalize lessons from Ukraine into permanent force constructs[16][17][18]. Humanitarian and societal impacts are substantial where event-level evidence is available: remote strikes in Ukraine and other theaters have produced non-trivial civilian casualties and disruption to essential services, undermining civilian resilience and generating chronic psychological and resource burdens consistent with analyses of attrition-focused warfare[27][28][29][30]. Analytically, the absence of primary, tier‑1 documentation for claimed transnational offensive campaigns suggests caution: doctrinal rhetoric and public organizational announcements should not be conflated with proven, theater-spanning operational employment without corroborating event-level data.

# Next steps and recommendations

To reduce ambiguity and better align doctrinal claims with operational facts, analysts and policymakers should prioritise improved event-level transparency and cross-regional monitoring. Specifically, datasets would benefit from systematic sharing of time-stamped launch and impact records where available, harmonized fatality coding practices to reduce divergent conservative defaults, and expanded geospatial verification capacity for rural and contested areas[31][32][33]. Monitoring should also widen scope to better capture small FPV and low-signature strikes that current long-range-focused compilations may miss, and regional open-source networks should be resourced to corroborate or refute claims of transnational employment. Finally, continued scrutiny of doctrinal statements—comparing declared organizational reforms and strategic aims to verifiable operational patterns in multiple theaters—will be essential to distinguish expanding capability from rhetorical posture[16][17][18].
