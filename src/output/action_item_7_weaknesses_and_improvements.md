Weakness:
- Citations were a bit iffy, with the generated report sometimes including URLS when explicitly instructed not to or not following correctly
the citation format. 
- Sections within sections aren't really used in the report, we only really have overarching sections (such as Methods, etc) but no further 
fragmentation within them. This isn't really in line with what we see in modern literature.
- Our report doesn't seem to utilize explicit statistics from our database crawls, instead it gestures at "increases" but doesn't give
concrete numbers. This indicates we might not be properly leveraging our database insights.


Improvements:
- Make more explicit instructions so that the system creates citations that better reflect our standards.
- Define how we can further fragment the report so that we have subsections as desired
- Have the report use specific statistics from our database crawls, perhaps via better employed input fields for this data.
