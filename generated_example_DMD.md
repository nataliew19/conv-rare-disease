This article is for education only and does not replace advice from your clinician.

## What is Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)?
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare, progressive genetic muscle disorder caused by loss of the dystrophin protein, leading to muscle wasting and weakness that usually begins in early childhood.[30] The condition primarily affects boys and is classified among the early-onset, severe muscular dystrophies.[31]

## Genetic cause and inheritance
- DMD is caused by mutations in the DMD gene on the X chromosome (Xp21.2).[1]  
- The most common mutation types are large exon deletions, which account for roughly 60–65% of cases, with duplications and point mutations making up most of the remainder.[1][8]  
- These mutations typically disrupt the reading frame, producing little or no functional dystrophin and causing the severe DMD phenotype as opposed to milder Becker muscular dystrophy when some dystrophin remains.[2][13]  
- Inheritance follows an X-linked recessive pattern: affected males usually have an affected or carrier mother, and females are usually carriers but can sometimes show milder symptoms.[1][2]

## Typical clinical features and organ systems affected
- Usual onset is in early childhood with delayed motor milestones, difficulty running or climbing stairs, frequent falls, and a waddling gait.[13][16]  
- Progressive skeletal muscle weakness leads to loss of ambulation in childhood or early adolescence.[25][13]  
- Cardiac muscle is commonly affected, with progressive dilated cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias becoming prominent contributors to illness and mortality.[30][6]  
- Respiratory muscle weakness develops over time and often leads to need for ventilatory support in adolescence or early adulthood.[26][25]  
- Some patients have cognitive or neurodevelopmental differences linked to loss of shorter dystrophin isoforms in the brain.[13][22]

## How DMD typically progresses (natural history and milestones)
- Early signs: motor delays and gait difficulties usually appear between ages 2–5 years.[13][16]  
- Loss of independent walking commonly occurs around ages 10–13 years without timely interventions.[25][23]  
- Respiratory decline and need for noninvasive ventilation often arise in the teenage years.[26][25]  
- Cardiac dysfunction develops progressively and is a leading cause of premature death; median life expectancy in many cohorts has been reported around the third decade but has improved with modern care.[25][26]  
- Disease course and timing of milestones are influenced by mutation type, genetic modifiers, and treatments such as corticosteroids.[41][26]

## Diagnosis and molecular testing
- Molecular testing is essential to confirm a clinical diagnosis of DMD.[10]  
- Typical diagnostic workflow:
  - Initial clinical evaluation including serum creatine kinase (CK) to screen for muscle damage.[10]  
  - Copy-number testing (e.g., MLPA or comparative genomic hybridization) to detect exon deletions/duplications as a first step.[10][11]  
  - If copy-number testing is negative but suspicion remains, full gene sequencing (Sanger or next-generation sequencing) is recommended to find point mutations and small sequence changes.[10][8]  
  - When genetic testing is inconclusive, muscle biopsy with dystrophin protein analysis (immunohistochemistry or Western blot) can be used in experienced centers.[10]  
- Combined molecular approaches can detect the large majority of pathogenic DMD variants, and testing is important for diagnosis, carrier detection, and family counseling.[11][12]

## Current management approach
- Care is multidisciplinary, typically provided through pediatric neuromuscular clinics that coordinate neurology, cardiology, pulmonology, orthopedics, rehabilitation, and genetic counseling.[31][34]  
- Key elements emphasized in guidelines:
  - Regular cardiac surveillance (echocardiography or cardiac MRI) beginning in childhood to detect early dysfunction.[34][7]  
  - Early initiation of cardioprotective medications (for example, ACE inhibitors) is often recommended to delay cardiomyopathy progression per recent expert consensus.[36][34]  
  - Proactive respiratory monitoring and timely use of assisted coughing techniques and noninvasive ventilation to manage respiratory failure.[7][26]  
  - Use of glucocorticoids to slow motor decline and preserve pulmonary function; steroids are associated with delayed loss of milestones.[26]  
- Many centers also provide orthopedic care (for scoliosis and fractures), bone health monitoring, and neurodevelopmental support as needed.[28][13]

## Prognosis and factors that influence outcomes
- Prognosis varies by genotype, clinical care, and access to multidisciplinary therapies.[41][26]  
- Important factors that influence outcome:
  - Mutation type and location can affect the age at loss of ambulation and cognitive features, although cardiac and motor courses do not always correlate tightly in all cohorts.[41][39][44]  
  - Use of corticosteroids, proactive cardiac medications, and respiratory support are associated with improved survival and delayed progression of key milestones.[26][25]  
- Cardiac complications and respiratory failure remain the main drivers of morbidity and mortality, even as survivals have improved with modern care.[25][26]

## Research, emerging therapies, and clinical trials
- Multiple research avenues are active, including gene therapies, exon-skipping approaches, cell therapies, and trials of cardiopulmonary-protective agents.[1][47]  
- Regulatory and post-approval experience shows gene therapies may be approved for narrow patient groups and often carry label-based restrictions and monitoring requirements; many approvals rely on surrogate endpoints rather than long-term cardiac or survival data.[47][45]  
- Ongoing or recent interventional trials target cardiopulmonary care and disease modification; typical trial enrollment criteria focus on confirmed DMD diagnosis, age ranges, and ambulatory status, and endpoints include functional tests (6-minute walk, timed function tests) and cardiopulmonary measures (spirometry, imaging biomarkers).[1][pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov]

## What is not known / limitations of current evidence
- The optimal timing and long-term impact of many emerging disease-modifying therapies on cardiac outcomes and overall survival remain uncertain; regulatory approvals have sometimes relied on surrogate markers rather than long-term hard outcomes.[50][51]  
- Genotype–phenotype correlations provide useful trends but cannot predict individual cardiac or motor trajectories with certainty.[39][44]  
- Some clinical trials and regulatory datasets lack extended follow-up focused on cardiopulmonary endpoints, leaving gaps in understanding long-term effectiveness and safety for the heart and lungs.[50][47]

Limited management information was available in the retrieved sources about specific institution-level pathways for implementing novel gene or cell therapies in routine clinical practice.

## Key takeaways
- DMD is caused by mutations in the DMD gene leading to loss of dystrophin and progressive muscle wasting with frequent cardiac and respiratory involvement.[1][30]  
- Molecular testing (copy-number assays plus sequencing) is essential to confirm diagnosis and enable genetic counseling.[10][11]  
- Multidisciplinary care with early cardiac and respiratory surveillance and therapies improves outcomes; however, important uncertainties about long-term cardiac effects of new therapies remain.[34][7][50]

If you are seeking care or genetic counseling for DMD, discuss testing and management options with your clinical team. This article summarizes current knowledge from selected sources and is not a substitute for individualized medical advice.
