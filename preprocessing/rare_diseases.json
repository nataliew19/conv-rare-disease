    "Signs and symptoms": "N/A",
    "Cause": "Mutation in several genes can lead to different types of 2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria. For example, the D2HGDH and L2HGDH genes provide instructions for making enzymes that are found in mitochondria - in which these enzymes break down D-2-hydroxyglutarate and L-2-hydroxyglutarate, respectively, as a part of normal reaction series that generate energy for cell activities. Any mutations occur in either of these genes would interrupt the functional enzymes and allow both 2-hydroxyglutarates to accumulate in cells, which cause 2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria type I. Moreover, it is known that type II for L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria and a mixed type for both 2-hydroxyglutarates come from mutations in IDH2 gene and SLC25A1 gene, respectively.[3][4]",

    "Disease": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency",
    "Signs and symptoms": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency can appear in a variety of ways in terms of clinical presentation, from a severe neonatal onset with potentially fatal consequences to an adult presentation.[1] Clinical signs of 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency appear either early in the neonatal stage or later in the first year of life.[3] Typically, nonspecific symptoms such as frequent vomiting, convulsions, and decreased alertness are displayed by patients. Typical laboratory results include higher plasma/serum transaminase activity, hyperammonemia, acidosis, hypoglycemia, and an increased anion gap.[1]",
    "Cause": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency is the result of HMGCL gene mutations.[1] HMGCL is found on chromosome 1p36.11's short arm and codes for the enzyme 3-hydroxymethyl-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A lyase (HMG-CoA lyase).[4][5] This mitochondrial enzyme contributes to the metabolism of dietary proteins by converting HMG-CoA into acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate, which is the last stage of the breakdown of leucine and fat for energy.[6] As a result, the body is unable to produce ketone bodies, which are necessary for generating energy during fasting.[7] 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency is passed down as an autosomal recessive trait.[2]",
    "Diagnosis": "Since 3-hydroxy isovaleryl carnitine (C5-OH) is typically elevated in this condition, 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency can be identified during newborn screening by testing it using tandem mass spectrometry methodology.[3] Enzyme activity testing in lymphocytes, immortalized lymphoblastoid cells, or fibroblasts, as well as HMGCL gene mutation studies, may confirm the diagnosis of 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency.[1]",
    "Treatment": "As with other uncommon inherited metabolic illnesses, there are no controlled treatment studies for 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency. Consequently, it is impossible to make any judgments about whether a particular diet or carnitine supplements are required. Clinical reports and pathobiochemical considerations suggest that the mainstay of therapy is avoiding fasting. L-carnitine supplementation may have detoxifying properties, prevent intracellular loss of free coenzyme A, and prevent secondary L-carnitine insufficiency.[14]",

    "Disease": "Abdominal epilepsy",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Abdominal epilepsy is marked by GI symptoms such as abdominal pain followed by uncontrollable vomiting, usually preceded by lethargy. Lethargy and confusion are the most common neurological symptoms associated with abdominal epilepsy. Other symptoms include generalized tonic-clonic seizures followed by sleep, and unresponsiveness.[10][11] Abdominal aura characterized by abdominal sensations precedes the abdominal seizure. This is associated with pain, nausea, hunger, gassiness, especially in temporal lobe epilepsy.[12]",
    "Cause": "It is unknown as to what causes abdominal epilepsy. While a causal relationship between seizure activity and the GI symptoms has not been proven, the GI symptoms cannot be explained by other pathophysiological mechanisms, and are seen to improve upon anticonvulsant treatment. Because the condition is so rare, no high-quality studies exist. There have been too few reported cases to identify risk factors, genetic factors, or other potential causes.[10]",
    "Diagnosis": "Criteria for diagnosis of abdominal epilepsy includes frequent periodic abdominal symptoms, an abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) and significant improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms after taking anti-seizure medication. Medical testing for diagnosis can be completed using MRI scans of the brain, CT scans and ultrasounds of the abdomen, endoscopy of the gastrointestinal tract, and blood tests.[10]\nTypically, the diagnostic process begins with gathering information regarding the presence of common symptoms like paroxysmal abdominal pain and other gastrointestinal issues. Symptoms that persist continuously or for prolonged periods are less likely to indicate abdominal epilepsy. It's important to consider convulsions, alterations in consciousness, and other neurological symptoms alongside gastrointestinal symptoms when diagnosing abdominal epilepsy. Though, every episode of it may not be accompanied by a neurological symptom. This often makes these neurological symptoms unnoticeable for the patient.[11]\nThis is followed by the necessary evaluation that comprises neurological and physical examination, laboratory test, abdominal imaging using CT and ultrasound, endoscopy. Next if the above are normal but the history still suggests for this syndrome an EEG must be performed. EEG findings alone cannot distinguish between the kinds of epilepsy. Moreover, an EEG report could be normal if an event is not accompanied by neurological symptoms. If it is doubtable, a neurologist should be consulted.[11]",
    "Treatment": "Like other forms of epilepsy, abdominal epilepsy is treated with anticonvulsant drugs, such as phenytoin. Based on the clinical response additional medication may be used for complementing it or it could be used instead of phenytoin. Since no controlled studies exist, however, other drugs may be equally effective.[10] Anticonvulsants target non-epileptic causes of abdominal pain via sedative mechanisms. It may also act just as a placebo. The prognosis is generally good and most patients are benefitted from medicines alone.[13]",

    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "The initial workup of Abetalipoproteinemia typically consists of stool sampling, a peripheral blood smear, and a fasting lipid panel, though these tests are not confirmatory.[19] As the disease is rare, though a genetics test is necessary for diagnosis, it is generally not done initially. However, prenatal testing may be available for pregnancies identified to be at an increased risk (if both parents are unaffected carrier or one parent is affected and the other in a carrier).{[20]}\nAcanthocytes are seen on blood smear.[21] Since there is no or little assimilation of chylomicrons, their levels in plasma remains low.[citation needed]\nThe inability to absorb fat in the ileum will result in steatorrhea, or fat in the stool.  As a result, this can be clinically diagnosed when foul-smelling stool is encountered.  Low levels of plasma chylomicron are also characteristic.[citation needed]\nThere is an absence of apolipoprotein B. On intestinal biopsy, vacuoles containing lipids are seen in enterocytes. This disorder may also result in fat accumulation in the liver (hepatic steatosis). Because the epithelial cells of the bowel lack the ability to place fats into chylomicrons, lipids accumulate at the surface of the cell, crowding the functions that are necessary for proper absorption.[citation needed]\nMultiple related disorders present with similar symptoms as abetalipoproteinemia that can provide a useful diagnosis through comparisons. Some of those disorders are:[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment normally consists of rigorous dieting, involving massive amounts of vitamin E.[12] High-dose Vitamin E therapy helps the body restore and produce lipoproteins, which people with abetalipoproteinemia usually lack. Vitamin E also helps keep skin and eyes healthy; studies show that many affected males will have vision problems later on in life. Common additional supplementation includes medium chain fatty acids and linoleic acid. Treatments also aim to slow the progression of nervous system abnormalities. Developmental coordination disorder and muscle weakness are usually treated with physiotherapy or occupational therapy. Dietary restriction of triglycerides has also been useful. Nutritionists often work with medical professionals to design appropriate dietary treatments for their patients.[2]",

    "Signs and symptoms": "N/A",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "The rarity and subsequent lack of information on acheiropodia makes prenatal diagnosis difficult. Diagnosis depends on prenatal ultrasound screening, with a failure to visualize bones at the ends of fetal limbs.[1] Due to variable expressivity (range in severity and types of signs and symptoms experienced by patients) of the C7rof2 gene, acheiropodia presents differently among affected individuals, adding to the difficulty of diagnosis.[15] Fingers are sometimes present, and a small bone at the tip of the shortened limb (the Bohomoletz bone) may or may not be present.[15]\nAcheiropodia has been diagnosed at as early as 16 weeks post-conception,[16] although research on similar conditions suggests it may be diagnosed even earlier.[17] If ultrasound screening indicates possible acheiropodia, further (more invasive) testing may be performed,[18] including genetic analysis of either an amniotic fluid sample or placenta (chorionic villus) sample to confirm diagnosis.[18][19] In the case of fetal death or termination, autopsy findings may conclude in a diagnosis.[18]",
    "Treatment": "Even with early prenatal diagnosis, due to its genetic basis acheiropodia cannot currently be prevented or cured. However, once a child is born with acheiropodia, prosthetics could improve their quality of life.[20] Surgery may be considered on a case-by-case basis to optimize prosthetic fitting.[20] Prosthetic fitting should occur before 2 years of age to minimize the risk of rejection.[20] Ideally, fitting should begin around the 6-9 month mark, when healthy infants typically begin using their hands and feet to stand and handle objects.[20] Even without prosthetics, many children with limb loss learn to functionally use their residual limbs and may prefer not to use prostheses so that they can maintain proprioception (i.e. sense of the body's position and motion) and sensory feedback that would otherwise be reduced.[21] Some children may adapt with compensatory skills that are more effective than prostheses.[10] A multidisciplinary approach may best treat the medical, psychological, and developmental challenges that may occur in infants missing all four limbs.[22]",

    "Cause": "Achondroplasia is caused by a mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene.[20] This gene encodes a protein called fibroblast growth factor receptor 3, which contributes to the production of collagen and other structural components in tissues and bones.[21] When the FGFR3 gene is mutated it interferes with how this protein interacts with growth factors leading to complications with bone production. Cartilage is not able to fully develop into bone, causing the individual to be disproportionately shorter in height.[22]\nIn normal development, FGFR3 has a negative regulatory effect on bone growth. In achondroplasia, the mutated form of the receptor is constitutively active, and this leads to severely shortened bones. This is an example of a gain of function mutation. The effect is genetically dominant, with one variant of the FGFR3 gene being sufficient to cause achondroplasia, while two copies of the mutant gene are invariably fatal (recessive lethal) before or shortly after birth. This occurs due to respiratory failure from an underdeveloped ribcage.[3] People with achondroplasia are often born to parents that do not have the condition due to spontaneous mutation.[23]\nWhere achondroplasia is inherited, its pattern is autosomal dominant. In couples where one partner has achondroplasia there is a 50% chance of passing the disorder on to their child every pregnancy. In situations where both parents have achondroplasia there is a 50% chance the child will have achondroplasia, 25% chance the child will not, and a 25% chance that the child will inherit the gene from both parents resulting in double dominance and leading to lethal bone dysplasia.[24]\nStudies have demonstrated that new gene mutations for achondroplasia are exclusively inherited from the father and occur during spermatogenesis; it has been theorized that sperm carrying the mutation in FGFR3 have a selective advantage over sperm with normal FGFR3.[4] The frequency of mutations in sperm leading to achondroplasia increases in proportion to paternal age, as well as in proportion to exposure to ionizing radiation.[25] The occurrence rate of achondroplasia in the children of fathers over 50 years of age is 1 in 1,875, compared to 1 in 15,000 in the general population.[26] Research by urologist Harry Fisch of the Male Reproductive Center at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in 2013 indicated that in humans this defect may be exclusively inherited from the father and becomes increasingly probable with paternal age, specifically males reproducing after 35.[27]\nThere are two other syndromes with a genetic basis similar to achondroplasia: hypochondroplasia and thanatophoric dysplasia.",
    "Diagnosis": "Achondroplasia can be detected before birth by prenatal ultrasound, although signs are often subtle and not apparent before the 24th week of pregnancy.[28] A DNA test can be performed before birth to detect homozygosity, wherein two copies of the mutant gene are inherited, a lethal condition leading to stillbirths. Postnatal diagnosis of achondroplasia is typically uncomplicated, involving an assessment of physical and radiographic features.[29]  Clinical features include megalocephaly, short limbs, prominent forehead, thoracolumbar kyphosis and mid-face hypoplasia.[30] Complications like dental malocclusion, hydrocephalus and repeated otitis media can be observed.[30] The risk of death in infancy is increased due to the likelihood of compression of the spinal cord with or without upper airway obstruction.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "There is no known cure for achondroplasia even though the cause of the mutation in the growth factor receptor has been found. Although used by those without achondroplasia to aid in growth, human growth hormone does not help people with achondroplasia, which involves a different hormonal pathway. Usually, the best results appear within the first and second year of therapy.[34] After the second year of growth hormone therapy, beneficial bone growth decreases,[35] so the therapy is not a satisfactory long-term treatment.[34] As of December 2020, the treatment of achondroplasia with human growth hormone was approved only in Japan.[36]\nA small-molecule drug vosoritide is used to improve growth velocity in children with achondroplasia,[10] although its long-term effects are unknown. Vosoritide inhibits the activity of FGFR3.[37] It has been gradually made available in different countries starting from 2021.\nLimb-lengthening will increase the length of the legs and arms of someone with achondroplasia,[38]  but little medical consensus exists regarding this practice. The age of surgery can vary from early childhood to adulthood.[39]\nResearch has also shown that introducing parents of children with achondroplasia to support and advocacy groups at the time of diagnosis can improve outcomes.[40] Several patient advocacy groups exist to support people with achondroplasia and their families.[41] Resources are available to support patients and their caregivers with information that they can distribute to their physicians, who may not be familiar with the unique medical requirements of managing achondroplasia. Physician-oriented best practice guidelines are also available to guide physicians managing the spinal disorders,[42] foramen magnum stenosis,[6] craniofacial implications,[43] pregnancy,[44] and peri-operative[45] needs of people with achondroplasia.\nHomozygous achondroplasia is invariably considered terminal even with aggressive treatment.",

The nystagmus becomes less noticeable with age but the other symptoms of the syndrome become more relevant as school age approaches. Visual acuity and stability of the eye motions generally improve during the first six to seven years of life – but remain near 20/200. Otherwise the syndrome is considered stationary and does not worsen with age.[citation needed]\nIf the light level during testing is optimized, achromats may achieve corrected visual acuity of 20/100 to 20/150 at lower light levels, regardless of the absence of color.[citation needed] The fundus of the eye appears completely normal.[citation needed]\nAchromatopsia can be classified as complete or incomplete. In general, symptoms of incomplete achromatopsia are attenuated versions of those of complete achromatopsia.

    "Diagnosis": "Since the immunostaining, abnormal gene, and abnormal chromosome profiles of AMSF tissues are non-specific, the diagnosis of these tumors rests mostly on patient presentation and tumor histopathologic grounds. AMSF may be confused with other myxoid-rich soft tissue tumors such as myxoid liposarcoma (MyxLPS), myxofibrosarcoma (MyxoFS), and extra-skeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (EMC). MyxoFS tumors more often occur in a proximal rather than acral location, consist of more prominent capillary vessels, and lack inflammatory and VRS-like cells. MyxLpS tumors consist of a monotonous cell population arranged in discrete myxoid-cellular clusters with conspicuous thin branching capillaries in a \"chicken-wire pattern\".[5] EMC rumors: contain an epithelioid/rounded cell population arranged in single cells, clusters, or linear cords; lack VRS-like cells; and have neoplastic cells that express diagnostic fusion genes involving the NR4A3 gene fused with either the EWSR1 or TAF15 gene. Some nodular fasciitis and proliferative fasciitis lesions may have myxoid areas but unlike AMSF tumors are rapidly growing, contain ganglion-like cells with only rare inflammatory cells,[5] and may regress without treatment.[14][15] Other lesions that frequently present in acral areas of the extremities such as  hemosiderotic fibrolipomatous tumor,[16] epithelioid sarcoma, synovial sarcoma, acral fibromyxoma, giant cell tumor of tendon sheath, and clear cell sarcoma are usually distinguished from AMSF based on their clinical presentations, gross pathologies, histopathologies, and/or neoplastic cell expressions of marker proteins, abnormal chromosomes, and/or abnormal genes.[5]",
    "Treatment": "Whenever possible, the first-choice treatment of AMSF tumors is surgical resection with wide margins in order to remove all neoplastic tissue. This treatment can be curative particularly when all tumor is removed but recurrences have developed at the sites of their surgical removals in 22% to 67% of all cases.[2] Repeated recurrences at a site are commonly treated with repeated surgical resections with some patients treated with several resections at a site.[11] Amputations of an extremity may be considered when wide resection fails to preserve a functional lower extremity or when multiple resections are consistently followed by recurrences.[2] Preoperative or postoperative radiation therapy may have a role in treating these tumors, especially in cases were surgical removal leaves tumor tissue behind. In a minority of cases (i.e. 1–2%), AMSF tumors metastasize to distant tissues.[2] Radiation and chemotherapy either alone or in combination have been used to treat metastatic disease.[11][12][17] While radiation therapy has been associated with improved local control,[4] its overall efficacy has not been fully studied and remains unclear.[4][18] The role of chemotherapy in the treatment of local and metastatic disease is also unclear.[2]",

Individuals afflicted with acrocephalosyndactyly and their caregivers can build a health care support system by building strong relationships with a team of medical specialists. Preformed teams of medical specialists can often be found at universities or research institutions. Caregivers can prevent future challenges by exploring options for financial aid, health insurance, and accommodating educational institutions. Primary caregivers are encouraged to prioritize their emotional health by reserving time for themselves and by sourcing a reliable support system.[29]"

    "Disease": "Acromesomelic dysplasia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Acromesomelic dysplasia (AMD) is characterized by the inhibition of growth of certain long bones such as the forearms and lower legs.[3] This disease typically becomes apparent during the first years of life.[3] Forearms, lower legs, hands and feet do not grow proportionally with the rest of the body.[4] Over time, individuals can have a hard time fully extending their arms, rotating the arms inwards towards the body with palms facing down and rotating the arms outward with the palms facing upward.[4] Abnormalities of cartilage and bone development may also cause the bones within the fingers, toes, hands and feet to become sufficiently shorter and broader.[4] During early childhood, individuals may experience progressive, abnormal curvature of the spine.[4] Common symptoms include:\n• Short stature\n• Progressive degeneration\n• Stiffness\n• Tenderness\n• Osteoarthritis\n• Abnormal bone shape\nInfants with AMD typically have a normal birth weight, but can have other characteristic facial abnormalities.[3]\n• Macrocephaly\n• Frontal bossing\n• Occipital prominence\n• Slightly flattened midface\n• Abnormally small, pug nose",
    "Cause": "AMD is extremely rare and is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic trait.[3] Autosomal recessive means that two copies of an abnormal gene must be present in order for the disease to develop.[5] This can be inherited from the parents or the gene can mutate in the person who has AMD.[3]",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is based on a clinical presentation, molecular analysis, electropherogram and radiograph.[9][3] This disease is diagnosed within the first few years of life.[3] Identification of the main characteristics is the key factor in diagnosis. Molecular analysis is used to examine the DNA of the affected person and their parents.[9] For this, a blood sample is needed and the DNA will be extracted with an automatic DNA extractor.[9] The results will show the mutated chromosome and identify if this chromosome was passed on from a parent.[9] A radiograph will show abnormal growth plates and misshapen bones in the limbs.[6][3][9] This can confirm the abnormal development and premature fusion of the regions where the diaphyses, of certain long bones, meet their epiphyses.[3] Electropherogram is used to identify genotyping.[citation needed] These results can be used to compare to a normal sequence and relatives sequences.[10]\nIt is important to have a detailed patient history, including the parents or other relatives.[3] Typically, the parent that carries the chromosome for AMD, seems to be shorter than average.[6][11] Monitoring the weight and height of the person affected with AMD is important.[10] Based on the person's age, they should be meeting a certain percentile to identify any issues that may be causing a stunt in growth.[3]\nThere are five types of AMD:[3]\n• Osebold-Remondini[12]\n• Maroteaux[6]\n• Grebe dysplasia[7]\n• Du Pan syndrome[13]\n• Acromesomelic dysplasia with genital anomalies[8]\nOsebold-Remondini causes shortness of limbs and hypoplasia of the second phalanges with fusion to the remaining phalanges, carpal and tarsal coalitions.[12] Maroteaux type causes severe dwarfism with a height below 120 cm.[6] This type also causes shortening of the middle and distal segments of the limbs.[6] Grebe dysplasia causes extreme abnormalities of the limb joints and limbs.[7] In this type of AMD, the hands and feet are affected the most.[7] This type primarily affects the joints in the hands and feet causing a lack of articulation.[7] Grebe dysplasia does not have any major effects on the stature.[7] Du Pan syndrome causes underdevelopment of the tissues in the fibulae, feet and hands.[13] Acromesomelic dysplasia with genital anomalies causes shortness of limbs and stature with congenital malformations of the female genital tract and male reproductive system.[8]\nAll five types of AMD are caused by a gene mutation or receiving it from their parents.[3] The differences between the types are the different genes that are affected. The mutated gene for each type is listed in the pathophysiology section.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "There are a few treatment plans for AMD and each person's results vary. Depending on the type of AMD and the symptoms the person has, their therapy may differ.[3] Physical therapy is aimed to help specific symptoms.[3] For example, abnormal curvature of the spine may be treated by exercises, braces, casts and in severe cases, corrective surgery.[3] It is important to start physical therapy as early as possible to ensure that people with AMD can reach their full potential.[3]\nOne treatment that can help a person who is affected with AMD is recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH).[3][14][15][10] Recombinant human growth hormones are produced in the pituitary gland and can help spur growth in children and adolescents.[16] It is used in AMD patients to help muscle and bone growth.[14][15][10][16] This treatment is long-term and will not cure this disease, it will only help the patient grow a couple of centimeters.[15][14][10] A case study showed a growth velocity of 3.6-4.2 cm/year during this first year of treatment.[14] As well as height improving from 1.2 to 1.8 SD over 5 years of treatment.[14] Another case study was conducted that showed within a year, a patient had an increase of 7.0 cm/year.[15] With this treatment, it is important to start it during the puberty stage.[15][10] Some patients that have received this treatment, have seen no difference or increase in height.[10] There is no prevention with AMD and not many options for managing the symptoms.[citation needed]\nKyphosis is an excessive outward curvature of the spine resulting in a hunch back.[17] Treatment for this disease includes taking pain relievers and osteoporosis medications.[17] Medication for osteoporosis helps strengthen the bones to help prevent any spinal fractures.[17] Lumbar hyperlordosis is a condition that occurs when the lower back region experiences stress or extra weight.[citation needed] This causes the lower back to become arched and creates muscle spasms or pain.[citation needed] Treatment focuses on stretching the lower back, quads, hip flexors and strengthening the hamstrings, glutes and abdominal muscles.[citation needed] Braces may be used to help relieve some stress or pressure on the lower back.[citation needed]\nRisk factors from taking rhGH include:[16]\n• Nerve, muscle or joint pain\n• Edema\n• Carpal tunnel syndrome\n• Numbness and tingling of the skin\n• High cholesterol\n• Increase the risk of diabetes\nOther risk factors that increase the risk of having AMD include a family history of having this condition or a child born from parents who are close blood relatives.[18]",

    "Disease": "Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "ADEM has an abrupt onset and a monophasic course. Symptoms usually begin 1–3 weeks after infection. Major symptoms include fever, headache, nausea and vomiting, confusion, vision impairment, drowsiness, seizures and coma. Although initially the symptoms are usually mild, they worsen rapidly over the course of hours to days, with the average time to maximum severity being about four and a half days.[20] Additional symptoms include hemiparesis, paraparesis, and cranial nerve palsies.[21]",
    "Cause": "Since the discovery of the anti-MOG specificity against multiple sclerosis diagnosis[24] it is considered that ADEM is one of the possible clinical causes of anti-MOG associated encephalomyelitis.[25]\nThere are several theories about how the anti-MOG antibodies appear in the patient's serum:\n• A preceding antigenic challenge can be identified in approximately two-thirds of people.[14] Some viral infections thought to induce ADEM include influenza virus, dengue,[26] enterovirus, measles,[27] mumps, rubella, varicella zoster, Epstein–Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis A, coxsackievirus and COVID-19.[22][28] Bacterial infections include Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Borrelia burgdorferi, Leptospira, and beta-hemolytic Streptococci.[29]\n• Exposure to vaccines: The only vaccine proven related to ADEM is the Semple form of the rabies vaccine,[30] but hepatitis B,[31] pertussis, diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella,[32] pneumococcus, varicella, influenza, Japanese encephalitis, and polio vaccines have all been associated with the condition.[33][34] The majority of the studies that correlate vaccination with ADEM onset use only small samples or are case studies.[35] Large-scale epidemiological studies (e.g., of MMR vaccine or smallpox vaccine) do not show increased risk of ADEM following vaccination.[9][36][30][37][20][38][39][40][41][42] An upper bound for the risk of ADEM from measles vaccination, if it exists, can be estimated to be 10 per million,[43] which is far lower than the risk of developing ADEM from an actual measles infection, which is about 1 per 1,000 cases. For a rubella infection, the risk is 1 per 5,000 cases.[38][44] Some early vaccines, later shown to have been contaminated with host animal central nervous system tissue, had ADEM incidence rates as high as 1 in 600.[36]\n• In rare cases, ADEM seems to follow from organ transplantation.[20]",
    "Diagnosis": "The term ADEM has been inconsistently used at different times.[45] Currently, the commonly accepted international standard for the clinical case definition is the one published by the International Pediatric MS Study Group, revision 2007.[46]\nGiven that the definition is clinical, it is currently unknown if all the cases of ADEM are positive for anti-MOG autoantibody; in any case, it appears to be strongly related to ADEM diagnosis.[25]",
    "Treatment": "No controlled clinical trials have been conducted on ADEM treatment, but aggressive treatment aimed at rapidly reducing inflammation of the CNS is standard. The widely accepted first-line treatment is high doses of intravenous corticosteroids,[65] such as methylprednisolone or dexamethasone, followed by 3–6 weeks of gradually lower oral doses of prednisolone. Patients treated with methylprednisolone have shown better outcomes than those treated with dexamethasone.[20] Oral tapers of less than three weeks duration show a higher chance of relapsing,[11][18] and tend to show poorer outcomes.[citation needed] Other anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapies have been reported to show beneficial effect, such as plasmapheresis, high doses of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg),[65][66] mitoxantrone and cyclophosphamide. These are considered alternative therapies, used when corticosteroids cannot be used or fail to show an effect.[citation needed]\nThere is some evidence to suggest that patients may respond to a combination of methylprednisolone and immunoglobulins if they fail to respond to either separately[67]\nIn a study of 16 children with ADEM, 10 recovered completely after high-dose methylprednisolone, one severe case that failed to respond to steroids recovered completely after IV Ig; the five most severe cases – with ADAM and severe peripheral neuropathy – were treated with combined high-dose methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin, two remained paraplegic, one had motor and cognitive handicaps, and two recovered.[65] A recent review of IVIg treatment of ADEM (of which the previous study formed the bulk of the cases) found that 70% of children showed complete recovery after treatment with IVIg, or IVIg plus corticosteroids.[68] A study of IVIg treatment in adults with ADEM showed that IVIg seems more effective in treating sensory and motor disturbances, while steroids seem more effective in treating impairments of cognition, consciousness and rigor.[66] This same study found one subject, a 71-year-old man who had not responded to steroids, that responded to an IVIg treatment 58 days after disease onset.[citation needed]",

Affected children also grow much more slowly than healthy children, commonly referred to as \"failure to thrive,\" which may lead to other developmental delays.[4]\nThese symptoms are not due to the enzyme deficiency itself, but rather to the effects of frequent severe infections from viruses, bacteria, and certain fungi.[4] Children are particularly vulnerable to repeated infections from the same organisms, as their lack of B-cells means they cannot produce IgG antibodies in significant amounts, which protect most people from pathogens that have infected them before.[5] Most individuals with ADA deficiency are diagnosed with SCID in the first 6 months of life.[6]\nThe large majority of cases of ADA deficiency are identified and diagnosed in children. However, a small minority have a less-severe form of the disease and remain undiagnosed until childhood, adolescence, or adulthood.[4][6]\nAn association with polyarteritis nodosa has been reported.[7]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis in developed nations is usually done through standardized newborn screening tests for a range of congenital diseases, including ADA deficiency. Most newborns with SCID, including those with ADA deficiency as an underlying cause, can be identified before the onset of major infections due to their decreased levels of T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs). TRECs are a normal product of T-cell development, and a deficit of them indicates a problem with lymphocyte maturation.[4]\nIn the absence of newborn screening or to differentiate from other causes of SCID, some (but not all) children will display one or more of these features which are sometimes seen in ADA deficiency but not other forms of SCID:[4]\n• Earlier onset of failure to thrive\n• Respiratory distress in an infant that is not caused by an infection\n• Abnormal rib cage development\n• Neurologic disorders, especially hearing loss\nWhen ADA deficiency is suspected, the diagnosis may be confirmed through several lab tests of the patient's red blood cells, or via genetic testing.[4]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment of ADA deficiency focuses on reducing the frequency and severity of infections. Antibiotics are typically prescribed as a prophylactic measure to make the body more difficult for pathogenic organisms to colonize. Due to the frequency it is encountered and its indifference to most antibiotics, clinicians must be careful to include a medication that can prevent Pneumocystis pneumonia.[11]\nIn addition to antibiotics, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy is also provided when available. This treatment provides a layer of humoral immunity from healthy plasma donors.[11]\nEnzyme replacement therapy is provided to newborns until a definitive therapy plan can be implemented.[11] There is some evidence that ERT also prevents tissue damage related to accumulated dATP and other molecules.[12]",

    "Disease": "Adenosine monophosphate deaminase deficiency type 1",
    "Signs and symptoms": "For reasons that are not understood, many people with defective variants of the AMPD genes are asymptomatic, while others have symptoms including exercise intolerance, and/or muscle pain and cramping.[1]\n• MADD lowers aerobic power output, so increased anaerobic power is needed to perform the same amount of work.[citation needed]\n• Without myoadenylate deaminase, heavy activity causes adenosine to be released into the cell or perfused into the surrounding tissues. Fatigue and sedation after heavy exertion can be caused by excess adenosine in the cells which signals muscle fiber to feel fatigued. In the brain, excess adenosine decreases alertness and causes sleepiness. In this way, adenosine may play a role in fatigue from MADD.[4]\n• Recovery from over-exertion can be hours, days or even months. In cases of rhabdomyolysis, which is the rapid breakdown of muscle fibers, time to recovery is dependent on duration and intensity of original activity plus any excess activity during the recovery period.[citation needed]\n• Muscle pain from MADD is not well understood, but is partially due to high levels of lactate. Increased levels of free adenosine temporarily decrease pain, allowing over-exertion without awareness.[5] The over exertion can cause mild to severe cases of rhabdomyolysis, which is painful.[6]\n• Adenosine mediates pain through adenosine receptors. MADD causes an increase of free adenosine during heavy activity which may cause exercise-induced muscle pain. Over time, excess free adenosine down-regulates primary A1 adenosine receptors, leading to increased muscle pain. Secondary receptors (A3) increase peripheral inflammation, which also increases pain.[7][8]\n• The cause of cramping is unknown, but may be related to elevated lactate, increased calcium signaling across the sarcoplasmic reticulum caused by membrane instability from reduced levels of ATP, or increased levels of free adenosine.[9]\n• Muscle weakness is not a major symptom, though the progressive effects of chronic muscle damage from rhabdomyolysis will eventually cause significant weakness. Similarly, the long-term metabolic effects may result in nerve damage.[6]",
    "Cause": "AMP deaminase is an enzyme that converts adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to inosine monophosphate (IMP), freeing an ammonia molecule in the process. It is a part of the metabolic process that converts sugar, fat, and protein into cellular energy. In order to use energy, a cell converts one of the above fuels into adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via the mitochondria. Cellular processes, especially muscles, then convert the ATP into adenosine diphosphate (ADP), freeing the energy to do work.[citation needed]\nDuring heavy or prolonged mild to moderate activity, other enzymes convert two molecules of ADP into one ATP molecule and one AMP molecule, making more ATP available to supply energy. AMP is normally converted into IMP by myoadenylate deaminase—so myoadenylate deaminase deficiency reduces energy that would be available to the cell through the purine nucleotide cycle. Instead of being converted to IMP, the AMP builds up in the cells of affected individuals, spills into the blood, and is eventually metabolized in the liver[citation needed]. In persons with a defective enzyme, 5'-nucleotidase removes the ribose and phosphorus from AMP, increasing levels of adenosine measured in muscle cells by ~16–25×, after exercise.[13][14]",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of MADD needs to be considered in patients who have exercise induced myalgia, cramps and sometimes weakness. A mildly elevated creatine kinase may also occur. Exclusion of other muscular diseases such as McArdle's Disease and carnitine cycle abnormalities should occur. MADD may be identified if there is a lack of ammonia rise after forearm exercise testing. The diagnosis may then be confirmed with genetic testing.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "It is important for MADD patients to maintain strength and fitness without exercising or working to exhaustion. Learning this balance may be more difficult than normally, as muscle pain and fatigue may be perceived differently from normal individuals.[19]\nSymptomatic relief from the effects of MADD may sometimes be achieved by administering ribose orally at a dose of approximately 10 grams per 100 pounds (0.2 g/kg) of body weight per day, and exercise modulation as appropriate. Taken hourly, ribose provides a direct but limited source of energy for the cells. Patients with myoadenylate deaminase deficiency do not retain ribose during heavy exercise, so supplementation may be required to rebuild levels of ATP.[20][21]\nCreatine monohydrate could also be helpful for AMPD patients, as it provides an alternative source of energy for anaerobic muscle tissue and was found to be helpful in the treatment of other, unrelated muscular myopathies.[22]",

Older patients affected with the cerebral form will present with similar symptoms.  Untreated, cerebral ALD is characterized by progressive demyelination leading to a vegetative state and death.[5]  Adult males with an adrenomyeloneuropathy presentation typically present initially with muscle stiffness, paraparesis and sexual dysfunction.[6]  All patients with clinically recognized ALD phenotypes are at risk for adrenal insufficiency.[5]  There is no reliable way to predict which form of the disease an affected individual will develop, with multiple phenotypes being demonstrated within families.[7]  Onset of adrenal insufficiency is often the first symptom, appearing as early as two years of age.[6]",

With the variety of phenotypes, clinical suspicion of ALD can result from a variety of different presentations.  Symptoms vary based on the disease phenotype, and even within families or between twins.[7]  When ALD is suspected based on clinical symptoms, the initial testing usually includes plasma very long chain fatty acid (VLCFA) determination using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.  The concentration of unsaturated VLCFA, particularly 26 carbon chains is significantly elevated in males with ALD, even prior to the development of other symptoms.[15] Confirmation of ALD after positive plasma VLCFA determination usually involves molecular genetic analysis of ABCD1.  In females, where plasma VLCFA measurement is not always conclusive (some female carriers will have normal VLCFA in plasma),[15] molecular analysis is preferred, particularly in cases where the mutation in the family is known.[4][6]  Although the clinical phenotype is highly variable among affected males, the elevations of VLCFA are present in all males with an ABCD1 mutation.[6]\nBecause the characteristic elevations associated with ALD are present at birth, well before any symptoms are apparent, there have been methods developed[16][17] in the interests of including it in newborn screening programs.[18]  One of the difficulties with ALD as a disease included in universal newborn screening is the difficulty in predicting the eventual phenotype that an individual will express.  The accepted treatment for affected boys presenting with the cerebral childhood form of the disease is a bone marrow transplant, a procedure which carries significant risks.[5][10]  However, because most affected males will demonstrate adrenal insufficiency, early discovery and treatment of this symptom could potentially prevent complications and allow these patients to be monitored for other treatment in the future, depending on the progression of their disease.[18]\nThe Loes score is a rating of the severity of abnormalities in the brain found on MRI. It ranges from 0 to 34, based on a point system derived from the location and extent of disease and the presence of atrophy in the brain, either localized to specific points or generally throughout the brain. A Loes score of 0.5 or less is classified as normal, while a Loes score of 14 or greater is considered severe. It was developed by neuroradiologist Daniel J. Loes MD and is an important tool in assessing disease progression and the effectiveness of therapy.[19]",

    "Signs and symptoms": "Adult polyglucosan body disease is a condition that affects the nervous system. People with this condition have problems walking due to reduced sensation in their legs (peripheral neuropathy) and progressive muscle weakness and stiffness (spasticity). Damage to the nerves that control bladder function (neurogenic bladder) causes progressive difficulty in controlling the flow of urine. About half of people with adult polyglucosan body disease experience dementia.[1]  Most people with the condition first complain of bladder issues.[2]\nPeople with adult polyglucosan body disease typically first experience signs and symptoms related to the condition between ages 30 and 60.[1]",
    "Cause": "APBD is an autosomal recessive disorder that is caused when a person inherits genes from both parents containing one or more loss-of-function mutations in the gene GBE1 which encodes for glycogen branching enzyme, also called 1,4-alpha-glucan-branching enzyme.[3]",
    "Diagnosis": "Along with evaluation of the symptoms and a neurological examination, a diagnosis can be made based on genetic testing.  Whether or not a person is making sufficient amounts of functional glycogen branching enzyme can be determined by taking a skin biopsy and testing for activity of the enzyme.  Examination of tissue biopsied from the sural nerve under a microscope can reveal the presence of polyglucosan bodies.

Patients experiencing a flare-up from adult-onset Still's disease usually report extreme fatigue, swelling of the lymph nodes and, less commonly, fluid accumulation in the lungs and heart. In rare cases, AOSD can cause life-threatening complications, including hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, intervertebral disc calcification (IVDC), fulminant hepatitis, or disabling conditions such as aseptic meningitis and sensorineural hearing loss.[7][8][9][1] Although more frequently described as associated with rheumatoid arthritis, Still's disease can lead to hematological complications such as thrombotic microangiopathy.[10]",

Mutation 45F is associated with a high risk of recurrence.\"[1] APC mutations affect FAP patients and make up a smaller percentage, 10–15%, of sporadic cases.[9]\nThe disease has a tendency to occur during and after pregnancy and in exposure to higher estrogen levels, suggesting a hormonal link.[10] One study noted the formation of desmoid tumors in guinea pigs after prolonged estrogen exposure.[11] Other factors include trauma and surgery.[8]\nRisk factors for desmoid disease amongst FAP patients include female sex, a 3' APC mutation, a positive family history, and a history of previous abdominal surgery.[12]",
    "Diagnosis": "A biopsy is always indicated as the definitive method to determine the nature of the tumor.[1] Diagnosis may be difficult in part due to the use of core needle biopsy over open biopsy.[13]\nSimilarities among bland spindle-cell lesions lead to a large number of possibilities in diagnosis, including fibroblastic sarcomas, Gardner fibroma, scar tissue or keloids, superficial fibromatosis, nodular fasciitis, myofibroma, collagenous fibroma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, solitary fibrous tumor, phyllodes tumor, and other conditions. Such conditions may therefore also be incorrectly diagnosed as desmoid tumors (29% of cases in one review).[14][10][15][16] Some 30–40% of desmoid tumors may be misdiagnosed.[17]",
    "Treatment": "Nirogacestat, a selective gamma secretase inhibitor, was approved for medical use in the United States in November 2023.[29] It is the first medication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of desmoid tumors.[29][30]\nA Phase 2/3 trial on AL102, another selective gamma secretase inhibitor, is also ongoing as of 2023[update], having begun in 2021.[31] The drug was granted orphan drug status in 2023.[32]\nWnt pathway inhibitors are also being developed and studied as of 2024[update]. These include E7386, tegavivint and ipafricept.[33] Additionally, the tumor microenvironment in desmoid tumors is being investigated to find new targets for treatment.[34]\nSurgery was the standard treatment for desmoid tumors up to the early 2000s.[2][35] Due to the condition's unpredictability, more conservative management such as watchful waiting has since become common due to the potential impacts of surgical interventions. As of the 2010s, there is a \"clear consensus\"[2] from medical groups, including the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Soft Tissue and Bone Sarcoma Group and the European Society for Medical Oncology: immediate surgical resection is no longer the first-line treatment, particularly in asymptomatic patients.[8][20][2] Complete removal is not always possible due to the tumors' infiltrative nature and tendril-like growth.[10]\nIn more advanced, recurring, or rapidly progressing cases, treatment may consist of complete surgical removal, radiation therapy, antiestrogens (e.g. tamoxifen), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), chemotherapy (e.g. methotrexate and vinblastine or vinorelbine, doxorubicin), or ablation (cold, heat, ultrasound). Treatment with oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor drugs (e.g. imatinib, sorafenib, pazopanib, sunitinib) shows promising success rates.[36][23][37][33][38] Radiation therapy after surgery may improve outcomes.[10][38] Despite the condition's hormonal link, anti-hormonal therapies only appear to work in a small subset of patients.[10]\nIntestinal transplant is a treatment option for those patients with complicated desmoid tumor, such as those involving the mesenteric root, or those with intestinal failure resulting from the tumor or prior interventions.[39]\nMRI or CT imaging scans are commonly used for monitoring.[40][1]\nIn contrast with cancer, management of desmoid tumors considers additional outcomes beyond progression-free survival and overall survival, as desmoid tumor patients' \"survival is longer and ... age of onset is generally younger compared with cancer patient populations\".[41]",

    "Disease": "Aldolase A deficiency",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The low incidence of this syndrome is often related to aldolase A's essential glycolytic role along with its exclusive expression in blood and skeletal muscle.[4]  Early developmental reliance and constitutive function prevents severe mutation in successful embryos.[5]  Infrequent documentation thus prevents clear generalisation of symptoms and causes. However five cases have been well described.[4]  ALDOA deficiency is diagnosed through reduced aldoA enzymatic activity, however, both physiological response and fundamental causes vary.[citation needed]",
    "Cause": "Characterised as a recessive disorder, symptomatic presentation requires the inheritance of aldolase A mutations from both parents.  This conclusion is substantiated through the continuum type presentation witnessed, wherein heterozygous parents have intermediate enzyme activity.  Structural instability has been indicated in four of the patients, with particular sensitivity to increased temperature according to direct enzymatic testing.  This is exemplified in the early diagnosis of hereditary pyropoikilocytosis in the Sicilian girl. Deterioration with fever is likewise congruent.[4]  However, this direct relation has been disputed due to the increased overall metabolism and oxygen consumption also accompanying such maladies.[11]\nSequence analysis has been conducted for three of the patients each revealing a distinct alteration at regions of typically high conservation.  The conversion of the 128th aspartic acid to glycine causes conformational change according to CD spectral analysis and thermal lability in mutagenic analysis.[3][12]  Similarly the charge disruption created through the exchange of the negatively charged glutamic acid for positively charged lysine (at residue 209 of the E helix) disrupts interface interaction of the protein's subunits and therein destabilises its native tetrahedral configuration.[9]  The final case is unique in its non-homozygosity.  A comparable maternal missense mutation wherein tyrosine is replaced by cysteine alters the carboxy-terminus due to its proximity to a crucial hinge structure.  However, the paternal nonsense mutation at arginine 303 truncates the peptide.  It is notable that Arg303 is required for enzymatic  activity.[4]\nThe initial 1973 case is atypical, in that no indication of aldolase A structural abnormality was found in isoelectric focusing, heat stabilization, electrophoresis or enzyme kinetics.  It was concluded that either disordered regulation or a basic defect creating more rapid tetrameric inactivation were the most probable causes.[10]",

It is caused by mutations in the gene for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)[11][12][13] that maps to chromosome 17q21. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, such that the child of a parent with the disease has a 50% chance of inheriting the condition, if the parent is heterozygotic. However, most cases arise de novo as the result of sporadic mutations.[3]\nAlexander disease belongs to leukodystrophies, a group of diseases that affect the growth or development of the myelin sheath. The destruction of white matter in the brain is accompanied by the formation of fibrous, eosinophilic deposits known as Rosenthal fibers.[3][14][15]",
    "Diagnosis": "Detecting the signs of Alexander disease is possible with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which looks for specific changes in the brain that may be tell-tale signs for the disease.[22][23] It is even possible to detect adult-onset Alexander disease with MRI.[17] Alexander disease may also be revealed by genetic testing for its known cause.[24][25] A rough diagnosis may also be made through revealing of clinical symptoms, including enlarged head size, along with radiological studies, and negative tests for other leukodystrophies.[21] However, due to the similarity of symptoms to other diseases such as multiple sclerosis, many adults experience misdiagnosis until they receive an MRI scan confirming Alexander disease pathology.[10]",

The pain can be severe to the point that interferes with activities of daily living and may affect the ability to work. Joint-replacement surgery (hip and shoulder) is often necessary at a relatively young age.[1] In the longer term, the involvement of the spinal joints leads to reduced movement of the rib cage and can affect breathing.[1] Bone mineral density may be affected, increasing the risk of bone fractures, and rupture of tendons and muscles may occur.[1]\nValvular heart disease, mainly calcification and regurgitation of the aortic and mitral valves, may occur, and in severe and progressive cases, valve replacement may be necessary. Irregularities in the heart rhythm and heart failure affect a significant proportion of people with alkaptonuria (40% and 10%, respectively).[1] Hearing loss affects 40% of people.

This man was treated with JAK inhibitor tofacitinib, and after ten months, he experienced hair regrowth on all of his affected body parts and subsequent improvement of his AD.[14][15] Current research and findings suggest that systemic JAK inhibitors eliminate and prevent the development of AA, while topical JAK inhibitors promote hair regrowth and reverse the established disease.[9][16] Many clinical trials are ongoing involving JAK inhibitors such as ruxolitinib and tofacitinib.[7][17]",

    "Disease": "Alpha-mannosidosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Alpha-mannosidosis is a lifelong multi-systemic progressive disease, with neuromuscular and skeletal deterioration over decades.[2] The timing of the appearance of symptoms correlates with the severity of the disease. The onset of the most severe form of the disease occurs within the first months of life and involves skeletal abnormalities and intellectual disability, with rapid progression leading to death from primary central nervous system involvement or myopathy.[2] However, most neonates with lysosomal storage disorders are asymptomatic and only rarely severely affected.[1][6] This delays diagnosis, particularly as milder forms of the disease involve only mild to moderate intellectual disability, which progresses gradually during childhood or adolescence.[7]\nThe first decade of life is characterised by the development of hearing impairment, psychomotor delay, recurrent infections, especially upper airway infections, pulmonary infections and acute/serous otitis media infections.[8] Significant changes in a number of facial features may occur, such as protruding forehead, flattened nasal bridge, small nose, wide mouth, and widely spaced teeth.[2] Muscular weakness or spinal abnormalities can occur due to the build-up of storage materials in the muscle.[2]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "Alpha-mannosidosis is a progressive disorder, and its presence should be suspected in patients with cognitive disabilities, skeletal changes (e.g., swollen joints, curved spine), hearing loss and recurrent infections. Although children with the condition are often born seemingly normal, their condition deteriorates with age. Alpha-mannosidosis can impact a patient's quality of life in many ways, including their ability to live independently, socialise or find employment.[2][8]\nGenerally, phenotypes of alpha-mannosidosis patients are not clearly distinguishable, which makes a prediction of the clinical course for an individual patient challenging.[2] Patients may present to doctors, nurses or health visitors at different stages of progression, and with different ad hoc symptoms, making the link to suspect a diagnosis of alpha-mannosidosis difficult.[2] The main symptoms can also be shared with those of other lysosomal storage disorders, such as mucopolysaccharidosis.[2]\nGiven the progressive nature of the disease, the earlier a correct diagnosis is achieved the better.[2] The condition is often diagnosed and treated using a multi-disciplinary approach, involving paediatricians, orthopaedics, ophthalmologists, otologists, neurologists, immunologists, neurosurgeons and physiotherapists.[8]\nA diagnosis of alpha-mannosidosis is suspected based upon identification of characteristic findings of a multi-symptomatic presentation, a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and results from the diagnostic tests described below:\n• Oligosaccharides in urine: A preliminary investigation may be performed to measure mannose-rich oligosaccharide concentrations in urine. Elevated urinary excretion of mannose-rich oligosaccharides is suggestive, but not diagnostic of the disease.[2]\n• Acid alpha-mannosidase activity: Diagnosis is confirmed by measuring residual alpha-mannosidase activity in leukocytes or other nucleated cells via a fluorometric assay.[2] This is the most reliable diagnostic method, along with genetic testing.[citation needed]\n• Genetic testing: Identification of disease-causing mutations is achieved using DNA from peripheral blood cells, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of all 24 MAN2B1 exons, followed by DNA sequencing.[2]",
    "Treatment": "There is no cure for congenital alpha-mannosidosis, and in general, the approach to management is proactive, with the aim of preventing emerging complications. After a full physical examination, physicians should focus on the known complications of alpha-mannosidosis, such as hydrocephalus, otitis media, hearing loss, dental caries, joint symptoms, kyphoscoliosis, and mental state.[2] Treatment is often limited to reducing or controlling the symptoms of the condition by, for example, medications to control seizures, hearing aids to ameliorate hearing loss, and routine physical therapy to assist with muscular pain and weakness.[2] In some cases, a wheelchair may be appropriate if muscle or spinal impairments immobilize the individual affected.[citation needed]\nHematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can be a treatment option for some patients, however the risk-benefit profile is more favourable in younger patients, therefore ensuring an early diagnosis is critical for this to be a viable option.[2] The rationale is that enzyme-producing donor cells repopulate the host tissue and transfer enzyme to nearby enzyme-deficient host cells.[2] Despite early reports to the contrary,[10][11][2] The possible benefits of HSCT must be weighed against the overall risk of procedure related morbidity and mortality. The benefits are greater in younger patients before complications have developed, and also transplant related complications are more frequent and severe in older patients.[citation needed]\nEnzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is a therapeutic alternative in a number of lysosomal storage diseases.[2][8] The overall principle of ERT is that a recombinantly produced version of the deficient enzyme is introduced into the blood stream, from where it is internalised by the cells and reaches the lysosomes by mannose-6-phosphate receptor mediated uptake, thus replacing the missing endogenous enzyme.[8] An ERT with velmanase alfa is approved for use in the European Union and the US.[12]",

    "Cause": "It is not known what causes sporadic ALS, hence it is described as an idiopathic disease.[19] Though its exact cause is unknown, genetic and environmental factors are thought to be of roughly equal importance.[13] The genetic factors are better understood than the environmental factors; no specific environmental factor has been definitively shown to cause ALS. A multi-step liability threshold model for ALS proposes that cellular damage accumulates over time due to genetic factors present at birth and exposure to environmental risks throughout life.[64] ALS can strike at any age, but its likelihood increases with age.[65] Most people who develop ALS are between the ages of 40 and 70, with an average age of 55 at the time of diagnosis.[66] ALS is 20% more common in men than women,[66] but this difference in sex distribution is no longer present in patients with onset after age 70.[65]",

    "Treatment": "Riluzole has been found to modestly prolong survival by about 2–3 months.[108][107] It may have a greater survival benefit for those with bulbar-onset ALS.[107] It may work by decreasing release of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate from pre-synaptic neurons.[11] The most common side effects are nausea and a lack of energy (asthenia).[107] People with ALS should begin treatment with riluzole as soon as possible following their diagnosis.[106] Riluzole is available as a tablet, liquid, or dissolvable oral film.[16]\nEdaravone has been shown to modestly slow the decline in function in a small group of people with early-stage ALS.[109][110] It may work by protecting motor neurons from oxidative stress.[111] The most common side effects are bruising and gait disturbance.[110] Edaravone is available as an intravenous infusion or as an oral suspension.[112]\nAMX0035 (Relyvrio) is a combination of sodium phenylbutyrate and taurursodiol, which was initially shown to prolong the survival of patients by an average of six months.[113] Relyvrio was withdrawn by the manufacturer in April 2024[114] following the completion of the Phase 3 PHOENIX trial[115] which did not show substantial benefit to ALS patients.\nTofersen (Qalsody) is an antisense oligonucleotide that was approved for medical use in the United States in April 2023, for the treatment of SOD1-associated ALS.[116] In a study of 108 patients with SOD1-associated ALS there was a non-significant trend towards a slowing of progression, as well as a significant reduction in neurofilament light chain,[117] a putative ALS biomarker thought to indicate neuronal damage.[118] A follow-up study and open-label extension suggested that earlier treatment initiation had a beneficial effect on slowing disease progression. Tofersen is available as an intrathecal injection into the lumbar cistern at the base of the spine.[116]\nA 2025 phase II study published found that tetramethylpyrazine nitrone is safe for patients with ALS, but it did not show a significant advantage over placebo in the primary efficacy measure.[119] Researchers noted that the drug may help slow the decline in grip strength, however further clinical trials are necessary to confirm its potential benefits.[120]",
    "Management": "There is no cure for ALS.[10] Management focuses on treating symptoms and providing supportive care to improve quality of life and prolong survival.[10] This care is best provided by multidisciplinary teams of healthcare professionals; attending a multidisciplinary ALS clinic is associated with longer survival, fewer hospitalizations, and improved quality of life.[5]\nNon-invasive ventilation (NIV) is the main treatment for respiratory failure in ALS.[11] In people with normal bulbar function, it prolongs survival by about seven months and improves the quality of life. One study found that NIV is ineffective for people with poor bulbar function[98] while another suggested that it may provide a modest survival benefit.[10] Many people with ALS have difficulty tolerating NIV.[99] Invasive ventilation is an option for people with advanced ALS when NIV is not enough to manage their symptoms.[5] While invasive ventilation prolongs survival, disease progression, and functional decline continue.[17] It may decrease the quality of life of people with ALS or their caregivers.[18][17] Invasive ventilation is more commonly used in Japan than in North America or Europe.[100]\nPhysical therapy can promote functional independence[101][102] through aerobic, range of motion, and stretching exercises.[103] Occupational therapy can assist with activities of daily living through adaptive equipment.[104] Speech therapy can assist people with ALS who have difficulty speaking.[102] Preventing weight loss and malnutrition in people with ALS improves both survival and quality of life.[10] Initially, difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) can be managed by dietary changes and swallowing techniques. A feeding tube should be considered if someone with ALS loses 5% or more of their body weight or if they cannot safely swallow food and water.[11] The feeding tube is usually inserted by percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). There is weak evidence that PEG tubes improve survival.[105] PEG insertion is usually performed with the intent of improving quality of life.[18]\nPalliative care should begin shortly after someone is diagnosed with ALS.[106] Discussion of end-of-life issues gives people with ALS time to reflect on their preferences for end-of-life care and can help avoid unwanted interventions or procedures. Hospice care can improve symptom management at the end of life and increase the likelihood of a peaceful death.[18] In the final days of life, opioids can be used to treat pain and dyspnea, while benzodiazepines can be used to treat anxiety.[17]"

    "Disease": "Alveolar capillary dysplasia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "ACD is a congenital disease whose symptoms appear within hours to days after birth. Babies with ACD usually have no symptoms at the time of birth, but soon after will begin to breathe rapidly, showing increased work of breathing, and may have blue discoloration around the lips, arms, or legs, especially when feeding or crying. If an echocardiogram is performed, marked thickening of the right ventricle will be seen, resulting from highly elevated pulmonary blood pressure. ACD is generally resistant to treatment. Babies who have persistent symptoms that are poorly relieved by standard therapies for neonatal pulmonary hypertension is commonly observed in ACD.[1]\nAtypical forms of ACD have been reported with only mildly rapid breathing shortly after birth. They may present with the above symptoms of ACD at several months of age. Their symptoms may improve with standard pulmonary hypertension therapies for weeks to months before symptoms return.[1]\nBabies born with ACD usually have other congenital abnormalities affecting the heart, the intestines, urinary system, or genitals.[1]",
    "Cause": "Most cases of ACD are caused by deletions or point mutations involving the gene FOXF1 on chromosome 16 or an area near the FOXF1 gene that regulates its expression. ACD is an autosomal dominant disorder, meaning only one disease-causing mutation affecting FOXF1 or its regulator region is needed to cause ACD. Evidence strongly suggests that the FOXF1 regulatory region is imprinted, which might affect disease severity and may permit some to carry the disease with few or no symptoms.[3]",
    "Diagnosis": "The gold standard for ACD diagnosis is by examination of lung tissue under a microscope. The diagnosis is made if the pathologist sees the characteristic findings of ACD: misplaced pulmonary veins adjacent to pulmonary arteries, abnormal alveoli with thickened interstitia and abnormal capillary development. Due to the rapidly progressive course of ACD, this diagnosis is frequently made during autopsy. If ACD is suspected early, examination of tissue from lung biopsy results in the quickest diagnosis.[1] Genetic testing for FOXF1 is now available and can allow for slower but non-invasive diagnosis. As not all disease-causing mutations are known, false negatives or results of uncertain significance are possible with genetic testing.[2]\nThere are no characteristic pattern of routine lab results or imaging findings that allow definitive diagnosis of ACD.[1]",
    "Treatment": "Initial treatments attempt to improve low blood oxygenation and high pulmonary blood pressures. Because blood oxygen content is usually very low, babies with ACD are often intubated, sedated, and mechanically ventilated with pure oxygen. Pulmonary vasodilators like sildenafil or inhaled nitric oxide can be used to reduce pulmonary blood pressures.[6] For those with severe ACD, these measures offer only momentary improvement. As symptoms worsen, ECMO can be used, but it also offers only brief improvement. There are no effective treatments for severe ACD.[1]\nFor infants with atypical ACD who initially had milder symptoms and present at months of life, there can be better response to therapy. There have been reports of infants with ACD surviving to 20 or 36 months without lung transplantation. Bilateral lung transplantation may be the definitive treatment.[citation needed]",

In fact, AAOCA is the second leading cause of sudden cardiac death in children and adolescents in the United States behind hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The prevalence is estimated at 0.1% to 0.3% of the general population. Neither the true risk of sudden death nor the best way to treat these patients is known with certainty.

If large quantities of unfractionated heparin are required e.g. greater than 35000 units per day, this would point towards resistance.  Antithrombin concentrates have been used, though with risk of bleeding at large doses of unfractionated heparin.  Low molecular weight heparin at full weight based dosing is effective; however, measurements of peak anti-Xa levels may not reflect anticoagulant effect.

Other imaging procedures and genetic testing may also be conducted to diagnose the disorder.[citation needed]\nIn some children, a diagnosis of Antley–Bixler syndrome may be suggested before birth (prenatally) based upon tests such as ultrasound. Ultrasound allows us to generate an image of the developing fetus, which may then reveal characteristic findings that are associated with the disorder. If there is a known family history of the condition, targeted genetic testing is available for patient families.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "The treatment of Antley–Bixler syndrome is directed toward the specific symptoms that are seen in each individual. Such treatment requires the coordinated efforts of a team of medical professionals who may need to systematically and comprehensively plan the treatment for a child with this condition. These professionals may include pediatricians, surgeons, physicians who specialize in disorders of specific body areas and organs. In individuals with Antley–Bixler syndrome, treatment typically includes surgery. The surgical procedures performed will depend upon the severity of the skeletal problems and its associated symptoms. It is possible that multiple surgeries will be needed in order to treat the malformations present.[citation needed]\nThere is no cure for the condition. All treatment is supportive and aimed at managing symptoms. However, early intervention may be important in ensuring that affected children reach their potential. For example, physical therapy is typically recommended to help improve the range of movement at certain joint contractures. Other therapies that may aide in managing symptoms include occupational therapy and speech therapy.[citation needed]\nBecause this is a genetic condition, individuals with Antley–Bixler syndrome and their families would benefit from meeting with a genetic counselor. Genetic counselors are professionals who have specialized education in genetics and counseling to provide personalized help patients may need as they make decisions about their genetic health.[citation needed]",

Many advocacy groups have advocate harshly against coercive genital reassignment however, and encourage infants genitals to be left intact. The nurture theory has been largely abandoned and cases of trying to rear children this way have not proven to be successful transitions.[3] Consensus recommends male gender assignment.[4][5][6]\nRecent advances in surgical phalloplasty techniques have provided additional options for those still interested in pursuing surgery.[7][8]",

    "Disease": "Aquagenic urticaria",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The main symptom of aquagenic urticaria is the development of physical hives, which may or may not itch. Itching after contact with water, without the development of physical hives, is known as aquagenic pruritus. Aquadynia is a condition in which pain occurs after contact with water.[2]\nIn severe cases, drinking water can result in swelling of the oral cavity,[3] swelling of the throat,[4] and in extreme cases, anaphylaxis.[5][6][7]\nThe hives associated with aquagenic urticaria are typically small (approximately 1–3 mm), red- or skin-colored welts (called wheals) with clearly defined edges. It most commonly develops on the neck, upper trunk and arms, although it can occur anywhere on the body.  Once the water source is removed, the rash generally fades within 30 to 60 minutes.[8]\nWater in all forms, such as tap or sea water, swimming pool water, sweat, tears, and saliva can induce the lesions.[9][10][11]",
    "Cause": "The cause of aquagenic urticaria is not fully understood; however, several mechanisms have been proposed.[12] Interaction between water and a component in or on the skin or sebum has been suggested. This theory suggests that a substance is formed by this interaction, the absorption of which causes perifollicular mast cell degranulation with release of histamine.[13][14] Another proposed theory is of a water-soluble allergen in the epithelial tissues. Water dissolves the allergen, causing it to diffuse into the tissues, causing histamine release from sensitized mast cells.[15][16]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis of aquagenic urticaria begins with a clinical history and water challenge test.[17] The water challenge test consists of application of a 35°C water compress to the upper body for 30 minutes. Water of any temperature can provoke aquagenic urticaria; however, keeping the compress at a similar temperature to that of the human body (37 °C) avoids confusion with cold urticaria or cholinergic urticaria. In addition, a forearm or hand can be immersed in water of varying temperatures to determine whether temperature is a factor in the patient's condition. Aquagenic urticaria differs from aquagenic pruritus, in which contact with water evokes intense itching without visible hives or rash.[18][19][20]\nOnce known as a separate, rare disease, aquagenic urticaria is now considered a subtype of general urticaria.[21] The first case was reported by Walter B Shelley et al. in 1964.[22] The condition is more common in women than men, and typically presents for the first time during puberty. Genetics may play a part, and the condition may be related to other sensitivities such as lactose intolerance.[23][24][25][26][27][13]",
    "Treatment": "Given the rarity of the disease, clinical efficacy data of treatments is limited. However, current recommendations suggest a trial of a second generation antihistamine up to four-times the standard dosing scheme for initial pharmacology.

Newborn screening for ASA is available in the U.S. and parts of Australia, and is considered in several European countries[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "During an acute hyperammonemic episode, oral proteins must be avoided and intravenous (I.V.) lipids, glucose and insulin (if needed) should be given to promote anabolism. I.V. nitrogen scavenging therapy (with sodium benzoate and/or sodium phenylacetate) should normalize ammonia levels, but if unsuccessful, hemodialysis is recommended. Long-term management involves dietary protein restriction as well as arginine supplementation. In those with frequent episodes of metabolic decompensation or with hyperammonemia even when following a protein-restricted diet, daily oral nitrogen scavenging therapy may be successful.

The arrhinia reconstruction process primarily involves two main parts: the reconstruction of the nasal cavity and the reconstruction of the external nose.[5]\nThere are two methods for reconstructing the nasal cavity. In the first method, two separate nasal cavities are created using a dental drill, and then silicone tubes are used to keep the newly formed nasal passages open. The second method involves a Le Fort II maxillary osteotomy, which involves making an incision through the maxillozygomatic consoles and towards the medial end of the inferior orbital rim. A horizontal arm connects the two sides, and then the maxilla is carefully fractured, creating a wide median nasal cavity that extends to the upper portion of the rhinopharynx. If the maxillary height is sufficient, the patient may only need a Le-Fort II osteotomy. However, if it is not high enough, the patient will require a Le-Fort II osteotomy first, followed by an extension along the maxillary bone. External distraction devices may also be used to provide additional facial height and sufficient midfacial vertical length for nasal reconstruction. Lengthening the maxilla has two advantages: it provides enough height for nasal cavity reconstruction and achieves suitable aesthetic proportions.[5]\nSurgical treatment methods for arrhinia can involve either staged reconstruction or simultaneous reconstruction of the nasal passage and the external nose.

There are a few syndromes like the Freeman–Sheldon and Gordon syndrome, which have craniofacial involvement.[4] The amyoplasia form of arthrogryposis is sometimes accompanied with a midline facial hemangioma.[4]\nArthrogryposis is not a diagnosis but a clinical finding, so this disease is often accompanied with other syndromes or diseases.

Using casts in order to correct joint deformities can be very effective since the joints can be misaligned and present with deformities. Another vital intervention that occupational therapists use to treat arthrogryposis, is range of motion exercises. This is in order to increase joint mobility.[44] The primary long-term goals of these treatments are increasing joint mobility and muscle strength and the development of adaptive use patterns that allow for walking and independence with activities of daily living.

Possible causes are perinatal hypoxic-ischaemia and neonatal shock in children born at term or near term. Hyperbilirubinaemia used to be a common contributing factor,[16] but is now rare in high-income countries due to preventive actions. Other aetiological factors are growth retardation,[17] brain maldevelopment, intracranial haemorrhage, stroke or cerebral infections.[8]\nCP in general is a non-progressive, neurological condition that results from brain injury and malformation occurring before cerebral development is complete.[3] ADCP is associated with injury and malformations to the extrapyramidal tracts in the basal ganglia or the cerebellum.[7] Lesions to this region principally arise via hypoxic ischemic brain injury or bilirubin encephalopathy.[7]",
    "Diagnosis": "Cerebral palsies have historically been diagnosed based on parental reporting of developmental motor delays such as failure to sit upright, reach for objects, crawl, stand, or walk at the appropriate age.[5] Diagnosis of ADCP is also based on clinical assessment used in conjunction with milestone reporting.[4] The majority of ADCP assessments now use the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) or the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (formerly the International Classification of Impairments Disease, and Handicaps), measures of motor impairment that are effective in assessing severe CP.[7][4]\nThe Barry-Albright Dystonia Rating Scale (BADS), the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMS) and the Dyskinesia Impairment Scale (DIS) are also commonly used to categorize clinical qualitative assessments of dyskinesia in DCP.[20][21][22]",

The main goal is to improve daily activity, quality of life and autonomy of the children by creating a timed and targeted management. The many management options for patients with DCP are not appropriate as standalone treatment but must be seen within an individualized multidisciplinary rehabilitation program.\nMedical treatment consists of oral medication and surgery. Before using oral drugs, it is important to differentiate between spasticity, dystonia, and choreoathetosis since each motor disorder has a specific approach. In general, many oral drugs have low efficacy, unwanted side-effects and variable effects.[35]\nOrthopedic surgery is performed to correct musculoskeletal deformities, but it is recommended that all other alternatives are considered first.[10]\nThe previous management options need to be combined with rehabilitation programs, adapted to the specific needs of each individual. Typically, the team of caregivers can consist of physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech/communication therapists. The therapy mainly focusses on the motor problems by using principles of neuroplasticity, patterning, postural balance, muscle strengthening and stretching.[36] Non-motor impairments such as epilepsy require specific treatment."

    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "aHUS is not the only condition that causes systemic TMA, a fact that makes differential diagnosis essential. Historically, the clinical diagnosis of TMA-causing diseases was grouped into a broad category that (in addition to aHUS) included thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli hemolytic uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS).[19][21] However, it is now understood that although aHUS, STEC-HUS, and TTP have similar clinical presentations, they have distinct causes and specific tests can be conducted to differentiate these diseases. In addition, there are other conditions that can cause TMA as a secondary manifestation; these entities include systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), malignant hypertension, progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS, also known as scleroderma), pregnancy-associated HELLP (hemolysis, liver dysfunction, and low platelets) syndrome, and toxic drug reactions (e.g., to cocaine, cyclosporine, or tacrolimus). Nevertheless, aHUS should be suspected in patients presenting with systemic TMA, and appropriate diagnostic work-up should be undertaken.[citation needed]\nThe neurological and kidney-related signs and symptoms of aHUS overlap with those of TTP.[13][23] However, unlike aHUS, TTP is primarily an autoimmune disorder in which the presence of an inhibitory autoantibody results in severe deficiency of ADAMTS13, an enzyme that cleaves von Willebrand factor (vWF, a large protein involved in blood clotting) into smaller pieces.[22] TTP also can be a genetic disorder characterized by mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene leading to severe ADAMTS13 deficiency. This congenital cause of ADAMTS13 deficiency is called Upshaw-Schulman syndrome.[24]) A lab test showing ADAMTS13 activity levels of ≤5% is indicative of TTP.[22]\nSimilarly, the gastrointestinal (GI) signs and symptoms of aHUS overlap with those of STEC-HUS.[12][25][26] Stool samples from patients with diarrhea or other GI symptoms should be tested for STEC and the presence of Shiga-toxin. However, a positive identification of Shiga-toxin, which is required to diagnose STEC-HUS, does not rule out aHUS. Nevertheless, in the appropriate clinical setting, a positive identification of Shiga-toxin makes aHUS very unlikely.[13][26]\naHUS patients report a mean timeline of 29 days for the overall diagnosis process from first noticing symptoms to receiving an aHUS diagnosis. During this time, they report an overall health state drop – from 88% of patients falling between good and excellent, to 99% falling between good and very poor – and a decrease in health status index by more than half – from 3.8 (on a scale of 1 to 5) pre-illness, to 1.4 at diagnosis.[27]",

Others may experience intense pain in one or in all three trigeminal nerve branches, affecting teeth, ears, sinuses, cheeks, forehead,  upper and lower jaws, behind the eyes, and scalp. In addition, those with ATN may also experience the shocks or stabs found in type 1 TN.[citation needed]\nMany TN and ATN patients have pain that is \"triggered\" by light touch on shifting trigger zones. ATN pain tends to worsen with talking, smiling, chewing, or in response to sensations such as a cool breeze. The pain from ATN is often continuous, and periods of remission are rare. Both TN and ATN can be bilateral, though the character of pain is usually different on the two sides at any one time.[2]",
    "Cause": "ATN is usually attributed to inflammation or demyelination, with increased sensitivity of the trigeminal nerve. These effects are believed to be caused by infection, demyelinating diseases, or compression of the trigeminal nerve (by an impinging vein or artery, a tumor, dental trauma, accidents, or arteriovenous malformation) and are often confused with dental problems.

    "Disease": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "ADPKD can result in a wide variety of clinical symptoms. Symptoms may be caused directly by a cyst growing or bursting, or indirectly due to problems with other physiological functions. Most symptoms occur around 40 years of age, but some clinical symptoms can occur decades prior to the development of over kidney disease, with some symptoms presenting as early as childhood.[11][12]\nPrimary Symptoms Include:[12]\n• Early-onset hypertension\n• Blood in urine\n• Abdominal, flank, or back pain\n• Masses in the abdomen or flank\n• Decrease in renal function\nAmong the most common symptoms associated with it is early-onset hypertension. Early-onset hypertension is present in 50%-70% of individuals with ADPKD.[11] Hypertension can even develop before the decline in kidney function markers like GFR (glomerular filtration rate).[11]\nThe presence of ADPKD is associated with several extra-renal symptoms, including the development of cysts in organs outside of the kidney. Polycystic liver disease is often found in adults with ADPKD and can be present in greater than 90% of individuals with ADPKD over 35 years old.[13] Polycystic liver disease develops more often in females with ADPKD than males, with risk factors including and exposure to non-endogenous sources of estrogen and multiple gestations. Individuals with polycystic liver disease due to ADPKD can also experience gastrointestinal symptoms related to the presence of cysts in the liver, such as early discomfort, fullness, and gastroesophageal reflux. In rare cases, portal hypertension with secondary ascites and pleural effusion can also occur.\nIndividuals with ADPKD are also at increased risk for developing intracranial aneurysms. The risk of intracranial aneurysms is estimated to be four times higher in people with ADPKD when compared to the general population, and as a result, screening with magnetic resonance angiography is recommended for high-risk populations.[13]\nAdditionally, symptoms such as abdominal fullness, excessive urination, and recurring urinary tract infections (occurring more frequently in women than in men), kidney stones, and bladder infection are also associated with ADPKD.[11]\nADPKD can also result in a wide array of symptoms beyond the kidneys, resulting in the following symptoms:[11][13]\n• Neurological: Arachnoid cysts, intracranial hemorrhage.\n• Cardiovascular: Pericardial effusion, mitral valve prolapse, bicuspid aortic valve\n• Endocrine: Pancreatic cysts\n• Gastrointestinal: Polycystic liver disease, diverticulosis\n• Pulmonary: Bronchiectasis\n• Reproductive: Male infertility, seminal vesicle cysts, ovarian cysts\nAmong the clinical presentation are:[citation needed]\n• Acute loin pain\n• Blood in the urine\n• Ballotable kidneys\n• Subarachnoid hemorrhage (berry aneurysm)\n• Hypertension\n• Associated liver cysts\n• Uremia due to kidney failure\n• Anemia due to chronic kidney disease\n• Increase RBC or erythropoietin secretion\nSigns and symptoms of ADPKD often develop between 30 and 40 years of age.[14]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "Usually, the diagnosis of ADPKD is initially performed by renal imaging using ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI.[37] However, molecular diagnostics can be necessary in the following situations: 1- when a definite diagnosis is required in young individuals, such as a potential living related donor in an affected family with equivocal imaging data;[37] 2- in patients with a negative family history of ADPKD, because of potential phenotypic overlap with several other kidney cystic diseases;[37] 3- in families affected by early-onset polycystic kidney disease, since in this cases hypomorphic alleles and/or oligogenic inheritance can be involved;[37][38] and 4- in patients requesting genetic counseling, especially in couples wishing a pre-implantation genetic diagnosis.[37][39]\nThe findings of large echogenic kidneys without distinct macroscopic cysts in an infant/child at 50% risk for ADPKD are diagnostic. In the absence of a family history of ADPKD, the presence of bilateral renal enlargement and cysts, with or without the presence of hepatic cysts, and the absence of other manifestations suggestive of a different renal cystic disease provides presumptively, but not definitively, evidence for the diagnosis. In some cases, intracranial aneurysms can be an associated sign of ADPKD, and screening can be recommended for patients with a family history of intracranial aneurysms.[40]\nMolecular genetic testing by linkage analysis or direct mutation screening is clinically available; however, genetic heterogeneity is a significant complication to molecular genetic testing. Sometimes, a relatively large number of affected family members need to be tested in order to establish which one of the two possible genes is responsible within each family. The large size and complexity of PKD1 and PKD2 genes, as well as marked allelic heterogeneity, present obstacles to molecular testing by direct DNA analysis. The sensitivity of testing is nearly 100% for all patients with ADPKD who are age 30 years or older and for younger patients with PKD1 mutations; these criteria are only 67% sensitive for patients with PKD2 mutations who are younger than age 30.[citation needed]\n• Adult polycystic kidney\n• Diagram of autosomal dominant polycystic disease with a normal kidney inset for comparison\n• Abdominal CT scan of an adult with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: Extensive cyst formation is seen over both kidneys, with a few cysts in the liver, as well. (Coronal plane)",
    "Treatment": "Currently, the only pharmacological treatment available for ADPKD consists of reducing the rate of gain of total kidney volume (TKV) with vasopressin receptor 2 (V2) antagonists (i.e., tolvaptan).[41] Tolvaptan treatment does not halt or reverse disease progression, and patients still progress towards renal failure.  Palliative treatment modalities involve symptomatic medications (nonopioid and opioid analgesics) for abdominal/retroperitoneal pain. Options for analgesic-resistant pain include simple or complex surgical procedures (i.e., renal cyst aspiration, cyst decortication, renal denervation, and nephrectomy), which can result in complications inherent to surgery.[citation needed] Recent research suggests that ketogenic dietary interventions beneficially affect the progression and symptoms in individuals with ADPKD.[42]  Mild weight loss favorably affects pain[43] indicating the benefit of dietary and lifestyle changes.",

    "Disease": "Baló concentric sclerosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "N/A",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "Baló's concentric sclerosis is primarily diagnosed through characteristic findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), supported by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and, in some cases, histopathological evaluation.[24] The hallmark radiological feature is the appearance of concentric layers of demyelinated and preserved white matter, producing alternating hyperintense and hypointense bands on T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences.[25] These lesions are typically large and tumefactive, often located in the cerebral hemispheric white matter, particularly the frontal and parietal lobes, but can also involve the corpus callosum, brainstem, or spinal cord.[25][22]\nUse of high-field 7-Tesla MRI has further refined lesion visualization, often revealing a central vein within Baló lesions, which supports the view of a perivenular pathogenesis similar to classical MS.[24] Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) has demonstrated increased lactate and decreased N-acetylaspartate within Baló lesions, indicating active inflammation and neuronal loss, while diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) shows decreased fractional anisotropy, reflecting white matter damage.[25] These imaging markers are highly consistent with histopathological features, enabling radiological-histopathological correlation and reducing the need for invasive biopsy in most cases.[25]\nCSF analysis in Baló's concentric sclerosis typically shows either normal findings or mild mononuclear pleocytosis, but differs from classical multiple sclerosis in that CSF-restricted oligoclonal bands are present only in a minority of cases.[13] Pattern III lesions, including Baló's concentric sclerosis, also tend to test negative for the MRZ reaction, which detects intrathecal responses to measles, rubella, and varicella zoster virus, further distinguishing them from standard multiple sclerosis.[13]\nIn pediatric populations, Baló's concentric sclerosis has been observed to have a more variable clinical course, with some children exhibiting favorable outcomes and lesion resolution on imaging, while other experience severe presentations similar to adult forms.[26] Baló lesions have been identified in children presenting with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)-like features, reflecting the overlap of concentric lesion morphology across multiple demyelinating syndromes.[26]",
    "Treatment": "Acute Management\nHigh dose intravenous corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, are commonly administered as first-line therapy for acute Baló's concentric sclerosis episodes to reduce inflammation and stabilize the blood-brain barrier.[27][28] However, responses to corticosteroids can be variable, with some patients exhibiting limited improvement.[27]\nImmunosuppressive and Disease-Modifying Therapies\nGiven the overlap of Baló's concentric sclerosis with other demyelinating disorders, various immunosuppressive agents have been explored:\nCyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent that suppresses the immune system, and has been used in aggressive or refractory cases of Baló's concentric sclerosis, sometimes in combination with other therapies.[27] Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody targeting CD20-positive B cells (B cell markers) and has shown to benefit patients with features suggestive of antibody-mediated pathology.[29][10] Another monoclonal antibody called Alemtuzumab targets CD52 and depletes a broad range of immune cells. The use of Alemtuzumab in Baló's concentric sclerosis has been reported in a case study indicating potential benefits, although some outcomes can vary.[18] Ocrelizumab is similar to Rituximad in that it targets CD20-positive B cells and has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing lesion size and improving neurological function in cases of Baló's concentric sclerosis.[28]\nSupportive Care and Monitoring\nRegular monitoring through MRI is essential to assess lesion progression or resolution. Given the potential for spontaneous remission in some cases, treatment plans should be individualized, balancing the risks and benefits of aggressive immunosuppression.[3] Multidisciplinary care, including physical and occupational therapy, may aid in functional recovery and improve quality of life.[27]",

Slowing head growth in the infantile form, poor circulation in lower extremities (legs and feet), decreased body fat and muscle mass, curvature of the spine, hyperventilation and/or breath-holding spells, teeth grinding and constipation may occur.[7]\nOver time, affected children experience mental impairment, worsening seizures and progressive loss of sight, speech and motor skills. Batten disease is a terminal disease; life expectancy varies depending on the type or variation.[8][9]\nFemales with juvenile Batten disease show first symptoms a year later than males, but on average die a year sooner.[10]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "Batten disease is rare; misdiagnosis may lead to increased medical expenses, family stress, and the chance of using incorrect forms of treatment, which may exacerbate the patient's condition. Nevertheless, Batten disease can be diagnosed if properly detected. Vision impairment is the most common observable symptom of the disease. Partial or complete loss of vision often develops in patients who have childhood forms of Batten disease, while it is usually preserved in those with adult-onset Batten disease.[13] Children or adults suspected of having Batten disease should initially see an optometrist or ophthalmologist. A fundus eye examination that aids in the detection of common vision impairment abnormalities, such as granularity of the retinal pigment epithelium in the central macula will be performed.[14] Though it is also seen in a variety of other diseases, a loss of ocular cells is a warning sign of Batten disease. If Batten disease is the suspected diagnosis, a variety of tests is conducted to help accurately confirm the diagnosis, including:\n• Blood or urine tests can help detect abnormalities that may indicate Batten disease. For example, elevated levels of dolichol in urine have been found in many individuals with NCL. The presence of vacuolated lymphocytes—white blood cells that contain holes or cavities (observed by microscopic analysis of blood smears)—when combined with other findings that indicate NCL, is suggestive for the juvenile form caused by CLN3 mutations.[15]\n• Skin or tissue sampling is performed by extracting a small piece of tissue, which then is examined under an electron microscope. This can allow physicians to detect typical NCL deposits. These deposits are common in tissues such as skin, muscle, conjunctiva, and rectum.[15] This diagnostic technique is useful, but other invasive tests are more reliable for diagnosing Batten disease.\n• Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a technique that uses special probes attached on to the individual's scalp. It records electrical currents/signals, which allow medical experts to analyze electrical pattern activity in the brain. EEG assists in observing if the patient has seizures.[15]\n• Electrical studies of the eyes are used, because as mentioned, vision loss is the most common characteristic of Batten disease. Visual-evoked responses and electroretinograms are effective tests for detecting various eye conditions common in childhood NCLs.\n• Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are diagnostic imaging tests that allow physicians to better visualize the appearance of the brain. MRI imaging test uses magnetic fields and radio waves to help create images of the brain. CT scan uses x-rays and computers to create a detailed image of the brain's tissues and structures. Both diagnostic imaging tests can help reveal brain areas that are decaying, or atrophic, in persons with NCL.[15]\n• Measurement of enzyme activity specific to Batten disease may help confirm certain diagnoses caused by different mutations. Elevated levels of palmitoyl-protein thioesterase is involved in CLN1. Acid protease is involved in CLN2. Cathepsin D is involved in CLN10.[15]\n• DNA analysis can be used to help confirm the diagnosis of Batten disease. When the mutation is known, DNA analysis can also be used to detect unaffected carriers of this condition for genetic counseling. If a family mutation has not previously been identified or if the common mutations are not present, recent molecular advances have made it possible to sequence all of the known NCL genes, increasing the chances of finding the responsible mutation(s).[15]",
    "Treatment": "Batten disease is a terminal illness; the FDA has approved Brineura (cerliponase alfa) as a treatment for a specific form of Batten disease. Brineura is the first FDA-approved treatment to slow loss of walking ability (ambulation) in symptomatic pediatric patients three years of age and older with late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2), also known as tripeptidyl peptidase-1 (TPP1) deficiency. Human clinical trials of a gene therapy for the CLN5 variant of Batten disease began at the University of Rochester in 2022.[16] Palliative treatment is symptomatic and supportive. One drug, an antisense oligonucleotide, milasen,[17] described in The New England Journal of Medicine,[18] is believed to be the first \"custom\" treatment for a genetic disease. It is named after Mila Makovec, the only patient who may ever take it.[19]",

    "Signs and symptoms": "Some symptoms consistent with Becker muscular dystrophy are:\nIndividuals with this disorder typically experience progressive muscle weakness of the leg and pelvis muscles, which is associated with a loss of muscle mass (wasting). Muscle weakness also occurs in the arms, neck, and other areas, but is not as noticeably severe as in the lower half of the body. Calf muscles initially enlarge during the ages of 5–15 (an attempt by the body to compensate for the loss of muscle strength), but the enlarged muscle tissue is eventually replaced by fat and connective tissue (pseudohypertrophy) as the legs become less used (with use of a wheelchair).[medical citation needed]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "In terms of the diagnosis of Becker muscular dystrophy symptom development resembles that of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. A physical exam indicates a lack of pectoral and upper arm muscles, especially when the disease is unnoticed through the early teen years. Muscle wasting begins in the legs and pelvis, and then progresses to the muscles of the shoulders and neck. Calf muscle enlargement (pseudohypertrophy) is quite obvious. Among the exams/tests performed are:[19][20]\n• Muscle biopsy (removes a small piece of muscle tissue, usually from the thigh, to check for dystrophin in muscle cells.)\n• Creatine kinase test (checks the level of Creatine Kinase proteins in the blood. Creatine Kinase proteins are normally found inside of healthy muscle cells, but can be found in the blood when muscle cells are damaged.)\n• Electromyography (shows that weakness is caused by the destruction of muscle tissue rather than by damage to nerves.)\n• Genetic testing (looks for deletion, duplication, or mutation of the dystrophin gene.)",
    "Treatment": "There is no known cure for Becker muscular dystrophy yet. Treatment is aimed at control of symptoms to maximize the quality of life which can be measured by specific questionnaires.[21] Activity is encouraged and can be considered vital for long-term survivability for these patients.[22] Inactivity (such as bed rest) or sitting down for too long can worsen the muscle disease. Physical therapy may be helpful to maintain muscle strength. Orthopedic appliances such as braces and wheelchairs may improve mobility and self-care.[14]\nImmunosuppressant steroids have been known to help slow the progression of Becker muscular dystrophy.[23] The drug prednisone contributes to increased production of the protein utrophin which closely resembles dystrophin, the protein that is defective in BMD.[24]\nThe cardiac problems that occur with EDMD and myotonic muscular dystrophy may require a pacemaker.[25] Other cardiomyopathies seen in Becker muscular dystrophy can also be treated with ACE inhibitors, cardiac transplant, and other personalized treatments.[22]\nThe investigational drug Debio-025 is a known inhibitor of the protein cyclophilin D, which regulates the swelling of mitochondria in response to cellular injury. Researchers decided to test the drug in mice engineered to carry MD after earlier laboratory tests showed deleting a gene that encodes cyclophilin D reduced swelling and reversed or prevented the disease's muscle-damaging characteristics.[26] According to a review by Bushby, et al. if a primary protein is not functioning properly then maybe another protein could take its place by augmenting it. Upregulation of compensatory proteins has been done in models of transgenic mice.[27]",

    "Disease": "Behçet's disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "N/A",
    "Cause": "The cause is not well-defined, but it is primarily characterized by auto-inflammation of the blood vessels. Although sometimes erroneously referred to as a diagnosis of exclusion, the diagnosis can sometimes be reached by pathologic examination of the affected areas.[14]\nThe primary mechanism of the damage is autoimmune, which by definition is an overactive immune system that targets the patient's own body. The involvement of a subset of T cells (Th17) seems to be important.[15] The primary cause is not well known. In fact, no one knows yet why the immune system starts to behave this way in Behçet's disease. There does however seem to be a genetic component involved, as first degree relatives of the affected patients are often affected in more than the expected proportion for the general population.[citation needed]\nResearch suggests that previous infections may provoke the autoimmune responses present in Behçet's disease. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are present in some bacteria and serve as a \"danger signal\" to the immune system. However, some HSPs share a similarity in bacteria and humans.[16] The anti-HSP60 and anti-HSP65 antibodies that target HSPs produced by Streptococci (including S. sanguinis and S. pyogenes) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis can also target human HSPs, leading to immune responses linked to uveitis and various symptoms shown in parenchymal neuro-Behçet's disease.[17]\nAn association with the GIMAP (\"GTPase of the immunity-associated protein\") family of genes on the long arm of chromosome 7 (7q36.1) has been reported.[18] Gene locations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with Behçet's disease included GIMAP1, GIMAP2 and GIMAP4.[18]",
    "Diagnosis": "There is no specific pathological testing or technique available for the diagnosis of the disease, although the International Study Group criteria for the disease are highly sensitive and specific, involving clinical criteria and a pathergy test.[4][24] Behçet's disease has a high degree of resemblance to diseases that cause mucocutaneous lesions such as Herpes simplex labialis, and therefore clinical suspicion should be maintained until all the common causes of oral lesions are ruled out from the differential diagnosis.[citation needed]\nVisual acuity, or color vision loss with concurrent mucocutaneous lesions or systemic Behçet's disease symptoms should raise suspicion of optic nerve involvement in Behçet's disease and prompt a work-up for Behçet's disease if not previously diagnosed in addition to an ocular work-up. Diagnosis of Behçet's disease is based on clinical findings including oral and genital ulcers, skin lesions such as erythema nodosum, acne, or folliculitis, ocular inflammatory findings and a pathergy reaction. Inflammatory markers such ESR, and CRP may be elevated. A complete ophthalmic examination may include a slit lamp examination, optical coherence tomography to detect nerve loss, visual field examinations, fundoscopic examination to assess optic disc atrophy and retinal disease, fundoscopic angiography, and visual evoked potentials, which may demonstrate increased latency. Optic nerve enhancement may be identified on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in some patients with acute optic neuropathy. However, a normal study does not rule out optic neuropathy. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis may demonstrate elevated protein level with or without pleocytosis. Imaging including angiography may be indicated to identify dural venous sinus thrombosis as a cause of intracranial hypertension and optic atrophy.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Current treatment is aimed at easing the symptoms, reducing inflammation, and controlling the immune system. The quality of the evidence for treating the oral ulcers associated with Behçet's disease, however, is poor.[26]\nHigh-dose corticosteroid therapy is often used for severe disease manifestations.[27] Anti-TNF therapy such as infliximab has shown promise in treating the uveitis associated with the disease.[28][29] Infliximab as well as other anti-TNF therapies including etanercept and adalimumab may be useful in treating mucocutaneous disease according to several case reports and prospective studies, as well as one randomized trial for etanercept.[30][31][32] Apremilast may also be used to treat oral ulcers associated with Behçet's disease.[33]\nInterferon alpha-2a may also be an effective alternative treatment, particularly for the genital and oral ulcers[34] as well as ocular lesions.[35] Azathioprine, when used in combination with interferon alpha-2b also shows promise,[36] and colchicine can be useful for treating some genital ulcers, erythema nodosum, and arthritis.[37] Benzathine-penicillin may also reduce new arthritic attacks.[38]\nThalidomide has also been used due to its immune-modifying effect.[39] Dapsone and rebamipide have been shown, in small studies, to have beneficial results for mucocutaneous lesions.[40][41]\nGiven its rarity, the optimal treatment for acute optic neuropathy in Behçet's disease has not been established. Early identification and treatment are essential. Response to ciclosporin, periocular triamcinolone, and IV methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisone has been reported although relapses leading to irreversible visual loss may occur even with treatment.[42] Immunosuppressants such as interferon-alpha and tumour necrosis factor antagonists may improve though not completely reverse symptoms of ocular Behçet's disease, which may progress over time despite treatment. When symptoms are limited to the anterior chamber of the eye prognosis is improved. Posterior involvement, particularly optic nerve involvement, is a poor prognostic indicator. Secondary optic nerve atrophy is frequently irreversible. Lumbar puncture or surgical treatment may be required to prevent optic atrophy in cases of intracranial hypertension refractory to treatment with immunomodulators and steroids.[citation needed]\nIntravenous immunoglobulin therapy (IVIg) could be a treatment for severe[43] or complicated cases.[44][45]\nA recent 2024 reports that infliximab improved the likelihood of achieving a complete response at 22 weeks for patients with severe Behçet's syndrome compared to cyclophosphamide, according to head-to-head trial data.[46] Mild to moderate adverse events, primarily infections, were reported in 29.6% of patients on infliximab and 64% on cyclophosphamide. Serious adverse events occurred in 15% and 12% of patients, respectively.[47]",

As a result, genetic testing is the only way to confirm the syndrome.[2]\nBHC is caused by a single-nucleotide substitution mutation in TITF1, which encodes thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. This gene is also known as NK2 homeobox 1 (NKX2-1)[2] The single-nucleotide substitution mutation then ultimately has drastic effects on the maturation processes of TITF-1[4]\nIn some cases, additional developmental abnormalities of lung and thyroid tissue are found in BHC, leading to the suggested alternative name brain-lung-thyroid syndrome.[6]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "BHC begins showing symptoms during childhood, and is commonly a familial disorder. This is a disorder that is correlated with mutations in the thyroid transcription factor gene (TITF-1).[7]\nThe disorder was discovered in 1960s. During the time of its discovery, there were no tests that could be used to confirm a diagnosis of the disorder, and the phenotype was not easy to distinguish from other disorders. This resulted in the existence of the disorder being questioned. However, in 2002, the experimentally observed mutation of the gene leading to the BHC phenotype was identified, solidifying benign hereditary chorea as a disorder.[7]\nIn 1967, several families were examined and discovered to have movements that were abnormal and random since childhood. These random movements were not violent movements, and gave the person a \"general appearance of restlessness.\" The movements occurred mostly in the hands and arms, and some also experienced them in their tongues, facial muscles, and lower body. Movements in the lower extremities, if severe enough, could cause changes in gait. The families were given a Wechsler Intelligence Scale test, scoring average relative to others in their community. Aside from the aforementioned symptoms, the peoples' physical and neurological characteristics were normal. The observed symptoms were put in the category of chorea.[7]\nResearchers made pedigrees of the families they studied and determined that BHC was an autosomal dominant disorder. By studying a Dutch family, the disorder was discovered to be linked to chromosome 14. In 2002, an Italian family was studied, and they had the same linkage to chromosome 14 as the Dutch family did. Looking closer at the region of the chromosome suspected of causing the disorder, researchers discovered that there was a 1.2 Mb deletion in the DNA that resulted in the loss of the TITF-1 gene. This meant that mutations in the TITF-1 gene were likely the reason behind the symptoms of BHC.[7]\nCurrently, BHC is diagnosed through the identification of the phenotypic symptoms with a genetic test to confirm the mutation in the TITF-1 gene.[7]",
    "Treatment": "N/A",
    "Management": "There are no cures for benign hereditary chorea, but there are several medications that have been shown to treat the symptoms of the disorder. Levodopa has been shown to improve the effects of chorea on a patient's gait within 6 weeks of starting treatments. However, this medication did have the side effect of \"dose-dependent dyskinesia.\" Methylphenidate has also been used to improve chorea symptoms. Steroids have been used to treat BHC, but due to the presence of dystonia, it is questionable whether these patients actually had BHC.[7]"

Serum IgM is low in most patients, while total IgG and IgA may be on the low end of normal. Patients demonstrate defective antibody production against T cell-independent, polysaccharide-based vaccines.  Some patients may not mount protective antibody titers to other vaccines, such as measles and varicella zoster virus.[2][7]\nT cell counts are generally within or just above the normal range. In vitro stimulation of T cells demonstrates that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are less responsive than normal, suggesting mild T cell anergy in patients.[1]\nA diagnosis of leukemia can generally be ruled out in these patients based on the unremarkable appearance of small resting lymphocytes in the blood; however, patients must be closely monitored for any signs of monoclonal or oligoclonal B cell expansion because there may be an increased risk for B cell malignancy. Specifically, one patient with BENTA disease was reported as having developed B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) as an adult.[1]",
    "Treatment": "There is currently minimal therapeutic intervention available for BENTA disease. Patients are closely monitored for infections and for signs of monoclonal or oligoclonal B cell expansion that could indicate B cell malignancy.

These episodes are called ketoacidotic attacks and can sometimes lead to coma. Attacks occur when compounds called organic acids (which are formed as products of amino acid and fat breakdown) build up to toxic levels in the blood. These attacks are often triggered by an infection, fasting (not eating), or in some cases, other types of stress.[citation needed]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "In beta-ketothiolase deficiency, alpha-methyl-beta-keto-butyrate, alpha-methyl-beta-OH-butyrate and tiglyl glycine (upstream metabolites of the affected enzyme) may accumulate and may be detected on urine organic acid analysis by GC-MS.  This may aid in the diagnosis, but for a more definitive diagnosis genetic confirmation needs to be done.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "During a ketoacidotic crisis, intravenous fluids with glucose and electrolytes should be administered immediately. Bicarbonate (initially as 1 mmol/kg over 10 minutes followed by continuous infusion) should be given to treat acidosis. Carnitine supplementation may be helpful. Dialysis is effective but usually not necessary. Unconscious patients and those with severe dyspnea may require mechanical ventilation. Long-term management involves avoidance of fasting (and intravenous glucose in cases of fever or vomiting) and, in children, a mildly restricted protein intake (1.5-2g/kg/day), avoidance of fat-rich (ketogenic) diet, and L-carnitine therapy in those with low carnitine levels.

Carriers of thalassemia genes may have no symptoms (thalassemia minor) or very mild symptoms with occasional crisis (thalassemia intermedia); individuals who are homozygous for the mutation have severe and life threatening symptoms (thalassemia major).[21][22]\nIndividuals with beta-thalassemia major usually present within the first two years of life with symptomatic severe anemia, poor growth, and skeletal abnormalities. Untreated thalassemia major eventually leads to death, usually by heart failure.[23]\nThose with beta-thalassemia intermedia (those who are compound heterozygotes for the beta thalassemia mutation) usually present later in life with mild to moderate symptoms of anemia.[22]\nBeta thalassemia trait (beta thalassemia minor) involves heterozygous inheritance of a beta-thalassemia mutation. Individuals usually have microcytosis with mild anemia; they are usually asymptomatic or have mild symptoms.[22] Beta thalassemia minor can also present as beta-thalassemia silent carriers; those who inherit a beta thalassemic mutation but have no hematologic abnormalities or symptoms.[22]\nIndividuals with thalassemia thalassemia major and intermedia (to a lesser extent) are susceptible to health complications that involve the spleen (hypersplenism) and gallstones (due to hyperbilirubinemia from peripheral hemolysis).[22][3] Additional symptoms of beta-thalassemia major or intermedia include the classic symptoms of anemia including fatigue, developmental delay in childhood, leg ulcers, and organ failure.[22] Ineffective erythropoiesis (red blood cell production) can lead to expansion of the bone marrow in compensation; this can then lead to deformity, bone pain, and craniofacial abnormalities.[22] Organs such as the liver and spleen that can also become enrolled in red blood cell production, leading to hepatosplenomegaly (enlargement of the liver and spleen).[22]\nPeople with thalassemia can get too much iron in their bodies, either from the disease itself as RBCs are destroyed, or as a consequence of frequent blood transfusions. Excess iron is not excreted, but forms toxic  non-transferrin-bound iron.[21][24] This can lead to organ damage, potentially affecting the heart, liver, endocrine system, bones and spleen. Symptoms include an irregular heartbeat, cardiomyopathy, cirrhosis of the liver, hypothyroidism, delayed puberty and fertility problems, brittle and deformed bones, and an enlarged spleen.[25][26]\nFor clinical purposes, thalassemia is categorised as either transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) or non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia (NTDT) are used.  Patients are usually considered as having NTDT if they have received fewer than 6 red blood cell units in the past 6 months and none in the preceding 2 months.[27]",

Jaundice, characterized by yellowing of the skin and eyes, is a common early sign.[4][5] Growth deficiencies are prevalent, with affected individuals often failing to meet weight and height milestones due to malabsorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, E, and K.[1][4][5] This can lead to Vitamin deficiencies, resulting in vision problems (vitamin A), rickets (vitamin D), neurological issues (vitamin E), and blood coagulation problems (vitamin K).[4]  Liver-related symptoms include hepatomegaly (enlarged liver) and splenomegaly (enlarged spleen), with elevated liver enzymes indicating liver dysfunction.[5] Patients may experience cholestasis, a condition where bile flow is interrupted, leading to pale stools, dark urine, and sometimes severe itching.[6] Steatorrhea, or excess fat in stools, is another symptom due to impaired fat digestion.[1][3] In severe cases, BASDs can progress to liver failure if untreated. The variability in symptom onset and severity depends on the specific genetic defect involved.[3]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosing Bile Acid Synthesis Disorders (BASDs) requires a comprehensive approach due to their rarity and symptom overlap with other liver diseases. Physicians begin by suspecting BASDs in infants or children presenting with jaundice, unexplained liver disease, or fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies.[1] Initial laboratory tests often include measuring serum bile acids.[7]\nAdvanced diagnostic techniques involve mass spectrometry, Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS), to analyze bile acid profiles in urine and blood.[8] These methods identify atypical bile acids and intermediates that accumulate due to enzyme deficiencies. Fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) is another technique used to detect specific bile acid patterns indicative of BASDs.[7][3] Genetic testing confirms the diagnosis by identifying mutations in genes responsible for bile acid synthesis enzymes.[9]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment for BASDs primarily involves oral bile acid replacement therapy. Cholic acid, approved in 2015, is the standard treatment for patients with single enzyme defects and peroxisomal disorders.[6] This therapy compensates for the lack of primary bile acids, restoring normal liver function and improving symptoms like jaundice and malabsorption.[10][3]\nIn some cases, ursodeoxycholic acid may be used alongside cholic acid to enhance bile flow, although it is ineffective as a sole treatment. The dosage of cholic acid is carefully monitored to suppress abnormal metabolite production and improve liver biochemistry.[3][10]\nFor patients unresponsive to medical therapy or with advanced liver disease, liver transplantation may be necessary. Early intervention with cholic acid has been shown to prevent progression to liver failure and improve long-term health outcomes, allowing many patients to lead normal lives into adulthood.[6]",

    "Disease": "Biliary atresia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Initially, the symptoms of biliary atresia are indistinguishable from those of neonatal jaundice, a usually harmless condition commonly seen in infants. However, infants with biliary atresia develop progressive conjugated jaundice, pale white stools, dark urine, and an enlarged palpable liver. Some infants fail to thrive as there will be a degree of fat and fat-soluble vitamin malabsorption (e.g. Vitamin K). This may cause a bleeding tendency. Eventually, and usually after 2 months, cirrhosis with portal hypertension will develop. If left untreated, biliary atresia can lead to liver failure. Unlike other forms of jaundice, however, biliary-atresia-related cholestasis mostly does not result in kernicterus, a form of brain damage resulting from liver dysfunction. This is because in biliary atresia, the liver, although diseased, is still able to conjugate bilirubin, and conjugated bilirubin is unable to cross the blood–brain barrier.[12]",
    "Cause": "The cause of biliary atresia in most infants is not fully understood and it is well possible that a number of factors may play a role, but especially maternal rotavirus infection during pregnancy and subsequent transmission of the virus to the child resulting in infection of the biliary epithelium and subsequent occluding fibrosis may be important in this respect.[13] Some cases may relate to infection with other viruses such as  SARS-CoV-2, hepatotropic virus reovirus 3,[14] or congenital cytomegalovirus.[15] In addition, autoimmune processes may contribute to pathogenesis in some cases as well.[16] However, with regard to these alternative causation the experimental evidence remains rather weak.[17]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is made by an assessment of history, physical examination in conjunction with blood tests, a liver biopsy, and ultrasound scans imaging and is prompted by prolonged or persistent jaundice, with abnormalities in liver function tests. Ultrasound or other forms of imaging such as radio-isotope liver scans can also be used but final confirmation is usually only reached at the time of exploratory surgery.[citation needed] Ultrasonography will usually show an absent or abnormal gallbladder.[27]",
    "Treatment": "Most (>95%) infants with biliary atresia will undergo an operation designed to retain and salvage the native liver, restore bile flow, and reduce the level of jaundice. This is known as the Kasai procedure (after Morio Kasai, the Japanese surgeon who first developed the technique) or hepatoportoenterostomy. Although the procedure is not thought of as curative, it may relieve jaundice and stop liver fibrosis, allowing normal growth and development. Published series from Japan, North America, and the UK show that bilirubin levels will fall to normal values in about 50-55% of infants, allowing 40-50% to retain their own liver to reach the age of 5 and 10 years (and beyond). Liver transplantation is an option for those children whose liver function and symptoms fail to respond to a Kasai operation.[29]\nRecent large-scale studies by Davenport et al. (Annals of Surgery, 2008) show that the age of the patient is not an absolute clinical factor affecting prognosis. The influence of age differs according to the disease etiology—i.e., whether biliary atresia is isolated, cystic (CBA), or accompanied by splenic malformation (BASM).[citation needed]\nIt is widely accepted that corticosteroid treatment after a Kasai operation, with or without choleretics and antibiotics, has a beneficial effect on postoperative bile flow and can clear jaundice, but there is currently no consensus on the ideal dosing and duration of steroid use.[30] Furthermore, it has been observed in many retrospective longitudinal studies that corticosteroid treatment does not seem to significantly prolong survival of the native liver or transplant-free survival.[31]",

    "Disease": "Bilirubin encephalopathy",
    "Signs and symptoms": "N/A",
    "Cause": "In the vast majority of cases, kernicterus is associated with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia during the neonatal period. The blood–brain barrier is not fully functional in neonates and therefore bilirubin can cross into the central nervous system. Moreover, neonates have much higher levels of bilirubin in their blood due to:\n• Rapid breakdown of fetal red blood cells immediately before birth, with subsequent replacement by normal adult human red blood cells. This breakdown of fetal red blood cells releases large amounts of bilirubin.\n• Severe hemolytic disease of the newborn. Many children who survive exhibit permanent mental impairment or damage to motor areas of the brain because of precipitation of bilirubin in neurons.\n• Neonates have a limited ability to metabolize and excrete bilirubin. The sole pathway for bilirubin elimination is through the uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase isoform 1A1 (UGT1A1) enzyme, which performs a reaction called \"glucuronidation\". This reaction adds a large sugar to the bilirubin, which makes the compound more water-soluble, so it can be more readily excreted via the urine and/or the feces. The UGT1A1 enzyme is not active in appreciable amounts until several months after birth. Apparently, this is a developmental compromise since the maternal liver and placenta perform glucuronidation for the fetus.\n• Administration of aspirin to neonates and infants. Aspirin displaces bilirubin from serum albumin, thus generating an increased level of free bilirubin which can cross the developing blood brain barrier. This can be life-threatening.[citation needed]\nBilirubin is known to accumulate in the gray matter of neurological tissue where it exerts direct neurotoxic effects. It appears that its neurotoxicity is due to mass-destruction of neurons by apoptosis and necrosis.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "Naturally, all neonates are prone to jaundice development due to immaturity of the liver that cannot filter the vast amount of fetal hemoglobin that is rapidly changing to Adult hemoglobin.[7] Therefore it is recommended to assess all newborns for jaundice.[8]\nKernicterus presents as jaundice and neurological symptoms such as cerebral paresis, gaze palsy and hearing loss. Bilirubin tests needs to be done on newborns as an indirect bilirubin level above 25 mg/dl, is diagnostic for kernicterus. If a newborn's Rh is different from its mother's Rh, then there is Rh incompatibility, which increases the risk of developing kernicterus.[7]",
    "Treatment": "Acute bilirubin encephalopathy's treatment would be phototherapy and exchange transfusion which is essentially changing the newborns blood.[9]\nCurrently, no effective treatment exists for kernicterus. Future therapies may include neuroregeneration. A handful of patients have undergone deep brain stimulation and experienced some benefit. Drugs such as baclofen, clonazepam, gabapentin, and artane are often used to manage movement disorders associated with kernicterus. Proton pump inhibitors are also used to help with reflux. Cochlear implants and hearing aids can improve the hearing loss that can come with kernicterus (auditory neuropathy – ANSD).[citation needed]",

The neurological symptoms usually present as episodes of increasing severity. A less common exhibition of BTBGD involves persistent symptoms, rather than recurrent episodes.[4] In these cases, fewer symptoms are usually present, with their severity slowly increasing over time.[citation needed]",

    "Treatment": "Treatment of BTBGD is done to manage specific symptoms and concerns.[5] If left untreated, the disease can be fatal. Treatment may vary by symptom, though it is common to administer thiamine (up to 40 mg/kg/day) and sometimes biotin (5-10 mg/kg/day) orally. This treatment is specifically used to address neurological symptoms and can reverse these symptoms if taken early enough. Biotin and thiamine oral therapy must continue throughout the entirety of the individual's life.[5] Other symptomatic treatments include anti-seizure medication to treat seizures and trihexyphenidyl or L-dopa to treat dystonia. Rehab and therapy are used for developmental and social concerns.[citation needed]",
    "Management": "Management of BTBGD includes prevention of symptoms and routine surveillance.[5] Avoiding stressors is essential in managing BTBGD since stress and trauma can trigger episodes. Fevers are also triggers, so fever control is important. Other triggers that should be avoided include infections and excessive exercise. Routine surveillance should include evaluation of the individual's nervous system, education and development, and any other relevant areas.[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "Biotinidase deficiency",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of a biotinidase deficiency (BTD) can appear several days after birth. These include seizures, hypotonia and muscle/limb weakness, ataxia, paresis, hearing loss, optic atrophy, skin rashes (including seborrheic dermatitis and psoriasis), and alopecia. If left untreated, the disorder can rapidly lead to coma and death.[citation needed]\nNeonates with BTD may not exhibit any signs, and symptoms typically appear after the first few weeks or months of life. If left untreated, around 70% of infants with BTD will experience seizures (staring spells, jerking limb movements, stiffness, flickering eyelids), which often act as the first symptom of BTD. Infants with BTD may also have weak muscles and hypotonia; this may cause infants to appear abnormally \"floppy\" and have affected feeding and motor skills. BTD may result in developmental delays, vision or hearing problems, eye infections, alopecia, and eczema. The urine of infants with BTD may contain lactic acid and ammonia. Other symptoms that infants may exhibit include ataxia, breathing issues, lethargy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and speech problems. The condition may eventually result in a coma and death.[1]\nBiotinidase deficiency can also appear later in life. This is referred to as \"late-onset\" biotinidase deficiency. The symptoms are similar, but perhaps more mild, because if an individual survives the neonatal period, they likely have some residual activity of biotin-related enzymes. Studies[2][3] have noted individuals who were asymptomatic until adolescence or early adulthood. One study pointed out that untreated individuals may not exhibit symptoms until age 21.[4] Furthermore, in rare cases, even individuals with profound deficiencies of biotinidase can be asymptomatic.[2]\nSymptom severity is predictably correlated with the severity of the enzyme defect. Profound biotinidase deficiency refers to situations where enzyme activity is 10% or less.[3] Individuals with partial biotinidase deficiency may have enzyme activity of 10–30%.[3]\nFunctionally, there is no significant difference between dietary biotin deficiency and genetic loss of biotin-related enzyme activity. In both cases, supplementation with biotin can often restore normal metabolic function and proper catabolism of leucine and isoleucine.[citation needed]\nThe symptoms of biotinidase deficiency (and dietary deficiency of biotin) can be quite severe. A 2004 case study from Metametrix[5] detailed the effects of biotin deficiency, including aggression, cognitive delay, and reduced immune function.",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "Biotinidase deficiency can be found by genetic testing.  This is often done at birth as part of newborn screening in several states throughout the United States.  Results are found through testing a small amount of blood gathered through a heel prick of the infant.  As not all states require that this test be done, it is often skipped in those where such testing is not required.  Biotinidase deficiency can also be found by sequencing the BTD gene, particularly in those with a family history or known familial gene mutation.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment is possible, but unless continued daily, problems may arise. Currently, this is accomplished through daily supplementation of 5–10 mg of oral biotin. If symptoms have started, standard treatments can take care of them, such as hearing aids for poor hearing.[citation needed]",

    "Diagnosis": "N/A",
    "Treatment": "Birdshot chorioretinopathy may show resistance to treatment. Immunosuppressant therapy along with oral corticosteroid has been somewhat effective in slowing down the progressive inflammation associated with the disorder, preserving visual integrity as much as possible. Long-term use of such medications must be closely monitored, however, due to the discomforting and potentially debilitating and life-threatening side-effects.[12][13]\nImmunosuppressive drugs such as the therapeutic monoclonal antibody daclizumab, ciclosporin, methotrexate and Adalimumab, sold under the trade name Humira, have proven to be effective treatment options for birdshot chorioretinopathy. Substantial reduction and even stabilization of both vitreous inflammation and retinal vasculitis have been evident via electroretinography, during daclizumab (IL-2 receptor blocker) therapy. This is also supported by the observation of elevated levels of IL-2 in the eyes of patients.[7] Loss of visual acuity unrelated to the inflammation caused by the disorder, however, often remains unchanged despite usage of the drug. This is reflected by the lack of difference in visual acuity and the vision-related quality of life among various treatment categories in birdshot patients.[14] Contraindications and adverse side-effects are always a factor, as well.[15]\nA corticosteroid implant surgically placed within the eye can be used for patients who are not able to achieve remission on or tolerate immunomodulatory therapy, or in cases where this option presents less of a burden on life than long-term medical therapy.[citation needed]",

    "Treatment": "N/A",
    "Management": "The extreme rarity of the disease limits the surgical opportunities to practice the complex closure required in these patients.

In the event the child was not born at a medical center with an appropriate exstrophy support team then transfer will likely follow. Upon transfer, or for those infants born at a medical center able to care for bladder exstrophy, imaging may take place in the first few hours of life prior to the child undergoing surgery.[3]\nPrimary (immediate) closure is indicated only in those patients with a bladder of appropriate size, elasticity, and contractility as those patients are most likely to develop a bladder of adequate capacity after early surgical intervention.[8]\nConditions that are absolute contraindications despite bladder adequacy include duplication of the penis or scrotum and significant bilateral hydronephrosis.[9]"

    "Diagnosis": "Bosma arhinia microphthalmia syndrome is typically diagnosed at birth due to its distinct facial features, such as the absence of the nose and small or absent eyes. The initial diagnosis is primarily based on a thorough physical examination.[5][2] However, genetic testing is needed to confirm the diagnosis by identifying mutations in the SMCHD1 gene. The SMCHD1 gene is analyzed using techniques such as next-generation sequencing to detect pathogenic variants that are characteristic of BAMS.[7] Such analyses are needed to distinguish BAMS from other syndromes that present with similar craniofacial abnormalities, such as CHARGE syndrome or Treacher Collins syndrome.[3][1][10] Due to potential endocrine dysfunctions associated with BAMS, hormonal evaluations may be conducted to assess for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which is common in affected individuals.[5][2]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment is primarily symptomatic and focuses on addressing the needs of each individual. Given the complexity and rarity of the syndrome, a multidisciplinary approach is often required, involving specialists such as pediatricians, endocrinologists, ophthalmologists, and craniofacial surgeons. Surgical reconstruction can be considered to improve both function and appearance of the nose. This may involve multiple staged surgeries to create a nasal structure that allows for normal breathing and enhances facial aesthetics. Advances in technology, such as 3D printing, have enhanced the ability to create custom nasal implants, improving cosmetic outcomes.[11][12] For individuals with microphthalmia or anophthalmia, ocular prosthesis can be used to improve cosmetic appearance. In cases where some vision is present, ophthalmologists may provide interventions to maximize visual function.[3][12]\nIndividuals with BAMS experience hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to disrupted gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons. Hormone therapy can help manage this condition by supplementing deficient hormones, thereby supporting normal pubertal development and fertility when appropriate.[4][10] Given the visible nature of craniofacial differences and potential social challenges, psychological support and counseling are often recommended for patients and their families.[5][12] Genetic counseling is also recommended to provide information about the hereditary aspects of BAMS.[12] Regular follow-up care is essential to monitor growth, development, and any emerging complications.

Topical treatment includes regimens of ice to cool the breasts.[9]\nTreatment of hyperprolactinemia-associated macromastia with D2 receptor agonists such as bromocriptine and cabergoline has been found to be effective in some, but not all cases.[38][39] Danazol, an antiestrogen and weak androgen, has also been found to be effective in the treatment of macromastia.[40]\nWhen hypertrophy occurs in adolescence, noninvasive treatments, including pharmaceutical treatment, hormone therapy,  and steroid use are not usually recommended due to known and unknown side effects.[citation needed] Once breast growth rate has stabilized, breast reduction may be an appropriate choice.

Other clinical problems associated with the disease include increased fatigue, weakness, muscle spasms, headache, difficulty gaining weight, and delay in puberty.  Some patients have an abnormal or absent tibia, may present with a flat foot, or have scoliosis.[1]\nThis disease may also cause bones to become abnormally hardened which is referred to as sclerosis. This hardening may affect the bones at the base of the skull or those in the hands, feet, or jaw. This causes ongoing pain and aching within the body parts that are affected. The pain has been described as either a hot electric stabbing pain, an ever-increasing pressure sensation around the bones (especially before electrical storms) or as a constant ache that radiates through several long bones at once. Pain may also occur in the hips, wrists, knees and other joints as they essentially lock up (often becoming very stiff, immobile and sore), mostly when walking up or down staircases, writing for extended periods of time, or during the colder months of the year. Those with the disease tend to have a very characteristic walk medically diagnosed as a 'waddling gait'. This is observed by the broad-based gait with a duck-like waddle to the swing phase, the pelvis drops to the side of the leg being raised, notable forward curvature of the lumbar spine and a marked body swing.[5][6]\nThe pain is especially severe during a flare-up, which can be unpredictable, exhausting and last anywhere from a few hours to several weeks. This is a common occurrence for several CED patients, often causing myopathy and extensive sleep deprivation from the chronic, severe and disabling pain. Patients may even require the use of a wheelchair (or additional carer's help with getting dressed, showering, mobility/shopping, preparing meals or lifting heavy items) especially when bedridden or housebound for days or weeks at a time. Flare-ups may be attributed to, or exacerbated by growth spurts, stress, exhaustion, exercise, standing or walking for too long, illness, infection, being accidentally knocked/hurt or injured, after surgery/anaesthetics, cold weather, electrical storms, and sudden changes in barometric pressure.[medical citation needed]\nCED may also affect internal organs, the liver and spleen, which may become enlarged.[medical citation needed] A loss of vision and/or hearing can occur if bones are adversely affected by the hardening in the skull. Hence proactive specialist check-ups, X-rays, diagnostic tests/scans, and regular blood tests are recommended on an annual basis to monitor the CED bony growth and secondary medical issues that may arise from this condition.[7]",

    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of neonatal/infantile Canavan disease relies on the demonstration of a very high concentration of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) in the urine. In mild/juvenile Canavan disease, NAA may only be slightly elevated; thus, the diagnosis relies on molecular genetic testing of ASPA, the gene encoding the enzyme aspartoacylase.[9]",
    "Treatment": "No cure for Canavan disease is known, nor is there a standard course of treatment. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Physical therapy may help improve motor skills, and educational programs may help improve communication skills. Seizures are treated with antiepileptic drugs and gastrostomy is used to help maintain adequate food intake and hydration when swallowing difficulties exist.[10] Also, an experimental treatment uses lithium citrate. When a person has Canavan disease, their levels of N-acetylaspartate are chronically elevated. The lithium citrate was proven in a rat genetic model of Canavan disease to decrease levels of N-acetyl aspartate significantly. When tested on a human, the subject's condition reversed during a two-week wash-out period after withdrawal of lithium.[citation needed]\nThe investigation revealed both decreased N-acetylaspartate levels in regions of the brain tested and magnetic resonance spectroscopic values that are more characteristic of normal development and myelination. This evidence suggests that a larger controlled trial of lithium may be warranted as supportive therapy for children with Canavan disease.[11]\nExperimental gene therapy trial results, published in 2002, used a healthy gene to take over for the defective one that causes Canavan disease.[12]\nIn human trials, the results of which were published in 2012, this method appeared to improve the patient's life without long-term adverse effects during a five-year follow-up.[13]",

Tumour cells are often found at the edge of the blood smear due to their large size, so this area should be examined thoroughly if carcinocythemia is suspected.[4]\nCytochemical staining and immunohistochemistry techniques can help determine the lineage of the cells.[4] When immunophenotyped by flow cytometry, the cells are generally CD45 negative and may express CD56, a profile that is non-specific but unusual for hematologic malignancies.[3] In some cases, flow cytometry and FISH results may be misleading, as circulating tumour cells can exhibit cell markers and chromosomal abnormalities associated with hematologic diseases.[4]\nBone marrow examination is indicated in carcinocythemia to better characterize the tumour cells.[3][4]",

    "Disease": "Caroli disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The first symptoms typically include fever, intermittent abdominal pain, and an enlarged liver. Occasionally, yellow discoloration of the skin occurs.[4] Caroli disease usually occurs in the presence of other diseases, such as autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, cholangitis, gallstones, biliary abscess, sepsis, liver cirrhosis, kidney failure, and cholangiocarcinoma (7% affected).[2] People with Caroli disease are 100 times more at risk for cholangiocarcinoma than the general population.[4] After recognizing symptoms of related diseases, Caroli disease can be diagnosed.[citation needed]\nMorbidity is common and is caused by complications of cholangitis, sepsis, choledocholithiasis, and cholangiocarcinoma.[5] These morbid conditions often prompt the diagnosis. Portal hypertension may be present, resulting in other conditions including enlarged spleen, hematemesis, and melena.[6] These problems can severely affect the patient's quality of life. In a 10-year period between 1995 and 2005, only 10 patients were surgically treated for Caroli disease, with an average patient age of 45.8 years.[5]\nAfter reviewing 46 cases of Caroli disease before 1990,  21.7% of the cases were the result of an intrahepatic cyst or nonobstructive biliary tree dilation, 34.7% were linked with congenital hepatic fibrosis, 13% were isolated choledochal cystic dilation, and the remaining 24.6% had a combination of all three.[7]",
    "Cause": "The cause appears to be genetic; the simple form is an autosomal dominant trait, while the complex form is an autosomal recessive trait.[2] Females are more prone to Caroli disease than males.[8] Family history may include kidney and liver disease due to the link between Caroli disease and ARPKD.[6] PKHD1, the gene linked to ARPKD, has been found mutated in patients with Caroli syndrome. PKHD1 is expressed primarily in the kidneys with lower levels in the liver, pancreas, and lungs, a pattern consistent with phenotype of the disease, which primarily affects the liver and kidneys.[2][6] The genetic basis for the difference between Caroli disease and Caroli syndrome has not been defined.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "Modern imaging techniques allow the diagnosis to be made more easily and without invasive imaging of the biliary tree.[9]  Commonly, the disease is limited to the left lobe of the liver. Images taken by CT scan, X-ray, or MRI  show enlarged intrahepatic (in the liver) bile ducts due to ectasia. Using an ultrasound, tubular dilation of the bile ducts can be seen. On a CT scan, Caroli disease can be observed by noting the many fluid-filled, tubular structures extending to the liver.[4] A high-contrast CT must be used to distinguish the difference between stones and widened ducts. Bowel gas and digestive habits make it difficult to obtain a clear sonogram, so a CT scan is a good substitution. When the intrahepatic bile duct wall has protrusions, it is clearly seen as central dots or a linear streak.[10] Caroli disease is commonly diagnosed after this “central dot sign” is detected on a CT scan or ultrasound.[10] However, cholangiography is the best, and final, approach to show the enlarged bile ducts as a result of Caroli disease.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "The treatment depends on clinical features and the location of the biliary abnormality. When the disease is localized to one hepatic lobe, hepatectomy relieves symptoms and appears to remove the risk of malignancy.[11] Good evidence suggests that malignancy complicates Caroli disease in roughly 7% of cases.[11]\nAntibiotics are used to treat the inflammation of the bile duct, and ursodeoxycholic acid is used for hepatolithiasis.[9] Ursodiol is given to treat cholelithiasis. In diffuse cases of Caroli disease, treatment options include conservative or endoscopic therapy, internal biliary bypass procedures, and liver transplantation in carefully selected cases.[11] Surgical resection has been used successfully in patients with monolobar disease.[9] An orthotopic liver transplant is another option, used only when antibiotics have no effect, in combination with recurring cholangitis. With a liver transplant, cholangiocarcinoma is usually avoided in the long run.[12]\nFamily studies are necessary to determine if Caroli disease is due to inheritable causes. Regular follow-ups, including ultrasounds and liver biopsies, are performed.[citation needed]",

Special staining under a microscope or utilizing a cell marker, such as PAX8, can be used to positively identify endometrial stroma.[6]",
    "Treatment": "Surgery, hormonal treatments and combined approaches have all been proposed, with variable results in terms of short and long term outcome.[14] These have both been effective, separately and together. Both have been used to treat women with this condition, and specifics depend on each patient and each situation. Surgery may be used to excise endometrial tissue from the lungs and pleural space as well as repair damage and holes in the diaphragm.[1] Surgery may also be used to remove blisters (blebs). An additional procedure involves a mesh that is placed over the diaphragm to block any holes that may have been missed in the first surgery. Hormonal therapies can also be used to suppress ovulation. Surgical removal of the endometrial tissue should be endeavored during menstruation for optimal visualization.[15] Pleurodesis may also be effective in removing the space between the lung and the chest wall; preventing air build up between these layers.\nNon-surgical treatment includes pharmacological treatment via continuous oral contraceptive therapy to avoid cyclical bleeding with monthly menstruation. Oral contraceptives appear to be preferable for patients due to fewer negative side effects than treatment with GnRH agonist therapy, which can lead to hypoestrogenic effects including osteoporosis, resulting in discontinuation of therapy and thus a higher likelihood of recurrence of catamenial pneumothorax.[6]",

    "Disease": "Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Although individuals with CPVT may not experience any symptoms, the most commonly reported symptoms are blackouts or sudden loss of consciousness, referred to as syncope.[1] These blackouts often occur during exercise or as a response to emotional stress—situations in which chemical messengers known as catecholamines, such as adrenaline, are released within the body. Blackouts may be misinterpreted as being caused by simple faints or epilepsy, often leading to delays in reaching the correct diagnosis.[7] In a third of those affected, the first manifestation of the disease may be cardiac arrest, potentially leading to sudden death.[8] This can occur in very young children, presenting as sudden infant death syndrome or 'cot death'.[1] Approximately 30% of those with CPVT will have a family member who has experienced blackouts, seizures, or sudden death in response to exercise or stress.[7]\nIn those with CPVT, catecholamine release can lead to an abnormal heart rhythm or arrhythmia known as ventricular tachycardia.[4] The ventricular tachycardia may take a characteristic form known as bidirectional ventricular tachycardia. This form of ventricular tachycardia occurs relatively infrequently, but if seen is suggestive of an underlying diagnosis of CPVT or the related condition Andersen-Tawil syndrome.[8][9] These ventricular arrhythmias in some cases terminate by themselves, causing a blackout from which the person then recovers. However, if the abnormal heart rhythm continues, it can degenerate into a more dangerous arrhythmia known as ventricular fibrillation causing a cardiac arrest and, if untreated, sudden death.[10]\nThere are typically very few abnormal signs on clinical examination in persons with CPVT. However, those with CPVT may develop a less serious heart rhythm disturbance called atrial fibrillation, which can be detected on examination as an irregular pulse.[8] Furthermore, approximately 20% of those with CPVT have a slow resting heart rate known as a sinus bradycardia.[4]",
    "Cause": "CPVT can be caused by mutations in several genes, all of which are responsible for regulating the concentrations of calcium within cardiac muscle cells. The most commonly identified genetic mutation in CPVT is a mutation in the RYR2 gene that encodes the cardiac ryanodine receptor, responsible for releasing calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.[16] Mutations associated with CPVT have also been identified in the CASQ2 gene which encodes calsequestrin,[17] a protein that binds calcium within the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Other genes associated with rarer, atypical forms of CPVT[16] include TECRL encoding Trans-2,3-enoyl-CoA reductase-like protein, CALM1, CALM2 and CALM3 all encoding Calmodulin, and TRDN encoding Triadin.[18]",
    "Diagnosis": "CPVT may be challenging to diagnose as the structure of the heart appears normal in those affected by the condition when assessed using an echocardiogram, cardiac MRI scan or cardiac CT scan, while the electrical function of the heart also appears normal at rest when assessed using a standard 12-lead ECG.[1][2] However, in response to exercise or catecholamines such as adrenaline, abnormal heart rhythms such as bidirectional ventricular tachycardia or frequent polymorphic ventricular ectopic beats may be seen.[22]",
    "Treatment": "Treatments for CPVT aim to prevent lethal abnormal heart rhythms from occurring, and to rapidly restore a normal rhythm if they do occur. As the arrhythmias in CPVT generally occur at times when the heart is exposed to high levels of adrenaline or other similar chemical messengers (catecholamines), many treatments for CPVT aim to lower the levels of catecholamines the heart is exposed to or block their effects on the heart.[8]\nThe first-line treatment for those with CPVT involves lifestyle advice. This includes avoiding competitive sports, very strenuous exercise and highly stressful environments, as high levels of adrenaline can occur in these settings, which can provoke arrhythmias.[2]",

Additional features include repetitive hand movements (stereotypies), such as clapping, hand licking, and hand sucking; tooth grinding (bruxism); disrupted sleep; feeding difficulties; gastrointestinal problems including constipation and gastroesophageal reflux. Some patients show irregular breathing.[4]",
    "Cause": "CDD is caused by pathogenic variants in the gene CDKL5. This gene provides instructions for making a protein (cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5) that is essential for normal brain development and function.[4] The CDKL5 protein is widely expressed in the brain, predominantly in nerve cells (neurons), with roles in cell proliferation, neuronal migration, axonal outgrowth, dendritic morphogenesis, and synapse development.[1] Inheritance Pattern: the CDKL5 gene is located on the X chromosome but nearly all known pathogenic mutations are de novo, rather than being inherited from an affected mother or father; the profound neurodevelopmental disabilities of CDD patients makes it extremely unlikely they would have children. There is one reported case of an inherited CDKL5 mutation; a mother carried a CDKL5 mutation on one X chromosome, but was high functioning and showed only mild cognitive impairment. The mother's mutant CDKL5 allele was skewed in its X-inactivation, being expressed in only 20% of circulating lymphoblasts. However, her daughter, who was diagnosed with CDD, expressed the mutant in 50% of her circulating lymphoblasts.[5]\nFemales: a mutation in one of the two copies of the CDKL5 gene in each cell causes the disorder. Males: a mutation in the only copy of the gene causes the disorder.[6]",
    "Diagnosis": "For the clinical diagnosis of CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder, minimal diagnostic criteria have been established, including motor and cognitive delays, epilepsy with onset within the first year of life, and the presence of a pathogenic or likely-pathogenic mutation of the CDKL5 gene.[7] While initial diagnosis is based mostly on clinical suspicion, definitive diagnosis requires confirmation by genetic testing. The first presentation of epileptic seizures within the first few months of life would suggest a possible diagnosis of CDD. Initial clinical testing for differential diagnosis may include MRI and CSF testing for structural or infectious etiologies; however, CDKL5 is now widely included in DNA sequence-based molecular diagnostic gene panels or infantile epilepsy for more rapid and precise diagnosis. Note: many adolescents and young adults may have CDD but were never tested since such tests were not available when they were infants. Therefore, epilepsy panels for CDD and other genes should be considered in such individuals.[8]\nA diagnostic ICD-10 code has been assigned to CDKL5 deficiency disorder: G40.42 (since 2020).[9]",
    "Treatment": "Antiseizure medications (ASMs) are used to manage seizures; however, in most cases, control is partial or transient.[10] Commonly used ASMs include valproic acid, clobazam, vigabatrin, felbamate, steroids, and lamotrigine for seizures,[11] although comprehensive data are limited for the efficacy and safety of ASMs in CDD; medications for infantile spasms include ACTH, prednisolone, and vigabatrin. Clinical trials support the efficacy some new ASMs.[12]\nIn March 2022, ganaxolone (Ztalmy) became the first therapeutic approved for the treatment of CDD symptoms. This drug, a GABA(A) receptor positive modulator, was approved by the US FDA in March 2022 for the treatment of seizures associated with CDD.[13]\nApproval from the EMA for the use of ganaxolone for the treatment of seizures associated with CDD was granted in July 2023.[14]\nCurrently, several other therapeutics are in phase 2 and phase 3 clinical studies for the treatment of CDD symptoms.\nMedications to control GI and sleep disturbances are often prescribed. Therapies, including physical, occupational, and vision therapy, are recommended.

    "Disease": "Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis manifests in a variety of ways, including several organs and a wide spectrum of neurological and non-neurological symptoms.[3] For CTX patients, the average age of symptom onset is 19 years.[4]\nIn patients with CTX, central nervous system symptoms and signs are frequently present and can serve as the first indications. Parkinsonism and epilepsy are the first neurological conditions associated with CTX.[5][6] A wide range of neurological characteristics associated with CTX have been documented in the literature; these characteristics include dystonia, progressive ataxia, palatal myoclonus, intellectual disability, dementia, and psychiatric symptoms (such as behavioral changes, depression, agitation, hallucinations, and suicidal thoughts).[2]\nOne common indicator of CTX is cataract which develops in childhood.[7] It has been highlighted that this is an early symptom that comes before neurological symptoms and tendon xanthoma, and it is thought to be helpful for an early diagnosis.[2] Adults with CTX frequently have cataracts and optic disk paleness as well.[8] Other ocular problems associated with CTX include deposits that resemble cholesterol and retinal vessel sclerosis.[9]\nAmong the many clinical symptoms of CTX that have been documented are cardiovascular disease and premature atherosclerosis.[10] Despite having normal serum cholesterol levels, patients with CTX experienced significant premature atherosclerosis.[11] Patients with CTX have a heightened risk of developing cardiovascular disease due to their significantly elevated levels of 27-hydroxycholesterol and decreased levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in their blood lipid analysis.[12]\nPatients with CTX frequently have osteoporosis and recurrent bone fractures as clinical symptoms. Patients with significant gait abnormalities who have little bone mass are more likely to fall and break their bones accidentally.[2] In CTX patients, serum calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D metabolites are normal, but intestine radiocalcium absorption is reduced and total body bone mineral density is poor.[13]\nChronic and intractable diarrhea is a common symptom of CTX.[14] Gallstones, cholecystic polypus, and newborn cholestatic jaundice are also observed in certain CTX patients.[15][8]\nIn individuals with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, xanthomas frequently develop in the second or third decade of life, while they can occasionally not develop. They usually originate on the Achilles tendons, although they have also been discovered in the lungs, bones, and central nervous system, as well as on the extensor tendons of the elbow, hand, patellar tendon, and neck.[8]",

When individuals present with neurological symptoms beginning in childhood with xanthomas, a CTX diagnosis should be taken into consideration.[2]\nEnhanced plasma cholestanol and elevated bile alcohol levels in urine, along with a decreased biliary concentration of chenodeoxycholic acid, are among the biochemical anomalies observed in CTX patients.[19] Another characteristic of CTX is an increased plasma level of cholestanol.[20]",
    "Treatment": "Surgery, replacement therapy, and additional symptomatic treatment are all part of the management of CTX.[2] Bile acids such as taurocholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), cholic acid, and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are administered as part of replacement treatment.[21][22] The preferred treatment for both neurological and non-neurological symptoms of CTX is CDCA treatment (750 mg/d), although cholic acid is also effective for non-neurological symptoms. Liver transplantation,[8] low-density lipoprotein apheresis,[23] and vitamin E supplementation are further potential treatments that do not yet have solid clinical backing.[2] Owing to the wide range of symptoms and signs associated with CTX, symptomatic treatment is crucial.[2] This includes antidepressant medicine for depression,[24] antiepileptic therapy for convulsive seizures,[5] levodopa for parkinsonism,[25] and botulinum toxin for dystonia.[26]",

    "Disease": "Cherubism",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The appearance of people with the disorder is caused by a loss of bone in the mandible which the body replaces with excessive amounts of fibrous tissue. In most cases, the condition fades as the child grows, but in rare cases the condition continues to deform the affected person's face. Cherubism also causes premature loss of the primary teeth and lack of eruption and or displacement of the permanent teeth.[1]\nCherubism is a rare autosomal dominant disease of the maxilla and mandible. Five hundred and thirteen cases were reported in the medical literature by 2021, with 57.2% being in males.[2] Cherubism is usually first diagnosed around age seven and continues through puberty and may or may not continue to advance with age.[3] Degrees of cherubism vary from mild to severe. Osteoclastic and osteoblastic remodeling contributes to the change of normal bone to fibrous tissue and cyst formation. As noted by the name, the patient's face becomes enlarged and disproportionate due to the fibrous tissue and atypical bone formation. The sponge-like bone formations lead to early tooth loss and permanent tooth eruption problems. The condition also affects the orbital area, creating an upturned eye appearance. The cause of cherubism is believed to be traced to a genetic defect resulting from a mutation of the SH3BP2 gene from chromosome 4p16.3.[4] While the condition is rare and painless, the afflicted suffer the emotional trauma of disfigurement. The effects of cherubism may also interfere with normal jaw motion and speech. Currently, removal of the tissue and bone by surgery is the only treatment available. This condition is also one of the few that unexpectedly stops and regresses.[5] Normal bone remodeling activity may resume after puberty.\nCherubism is displayed with genetic conformation and when excessive osteoclasts are found in the affected areas of the mandible and maxilla. Large cysts will be present with excessive fibrous areas inside the bone. The fibers and cysts will be found among the trabecula of the Coronoid process, the ramus of mandible, the body of mandible and the maxilla regions. The maxilla will be affected up to and including the orbits and sometimes inside the lower orbits.[6] The maxilla and zygomatic bones are depressed and eyes appear to gaze upward.[7]   The maxilla has been found to be more severely affected in most cases than the mandible bone. Some patients found with lower inner orbital growths and cysts may lose vision.",
    "Cause": "Cherubism is autosomal dominantly linked. Cherubism has also been found from the random mutation of a gene in an individual having no family history of the condition. However it is not well understood why males tend to express the disease more frequently.  Children with cherubism vary in severity in their maxilla and mandible bony lesions. The disease is expressed at a rate of 80 to 100% of all affected.  Studies of multiple generations of families with the gene found that all boys developed cherubism, but 30–50% of girls show no symptoms.[8]\nThe cause of cherubism is believed to be from a mutation of gene of SH3BP2. Cherubism has also been found combined with other genetic disorders including Noonan syndrome, Ramon syndrome, and fragile X syndrome.[9] SH3BP2 mutations were reported in 93.5% of the cases in which the gene was investigated and mainly occurred at protein residues 415, 418, 419, and 420.[2] The mutation of the SH3BP2 gene is believed to increase production of over active proteins from this gene. However, Specific amino acid substitutions of SH3BP2 mutations were not associated with the clinical grading of the disease.[2] The SH3BP2 gene is found on the smaller arm of chromosome 4 at position 16.3.[4] The SH3BP2 protein is involved with chemical signaling to immune system cells known as macrophages and B cells.[citation needed]\nThe effects of SH3BP2 mutations are still under study, but researchers believe that the abnormal protein disrupts critical signaling pathways in cells associated with the maintenance of bone tissue and in some immune system cells. The overactive protein likely causes inflammation in the jaw bones and triggers the production of osteoclasts, which are cells that break down bone tissue during bone remodeling. Osteoclasts also sense the increased inflammation of the mandible and maxilla and are further activated to break down bone structures.  Bone loss and inflammation lead to increased fibrous tissue and cyst growth. An excess of these bone-eating cells contributes to the destruction of bone in the upper and lower jaws. A combination of bone loss and inflammation likely underlies the cyst-like growths characteristic of cherubism.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "The chemical imbalance is usually diagnosed when dental abnormalities are found. These abnormalities include premature deciduous teeth and abnormal growth of permanent teeth due to displacement by cysts and lesions. The only definite way to correctly diagnose the condition is by sequence analysis of the SH3BP2 gene. The gene has been found to have missense mutation in exon 9.[5] Initial study of the patient is usually conducted using x-ray and CT scans. Neurofibromatosis may resemble cherubism and may accompany the condition. Genetic testing is the final diagnosis tool.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Because cherubism changes and improves over time, the treatment should be individually determined. Generally, moderate cases are watched until they subside or progress into the more severe range. Severe cases may require surgery to eliminate bulk cysts and fibrous growth of the maxilla and mandible. There are few reports in the medical literature in which the patients were treated with different medical drugs.[2] Surgical bone grafting of the cranial facial bones may be successful on some patients. Surgery is preferred for patients aged 5 to 15.[3] Special consideration should be taken when operating on the face to avoid the marginal mandibular branch as well as the zygomatic branch of the facial nerve. Unintentional damage to these nerves can decrease muscle strength in the face and mandible region. Orthodontic treatment is generally required to avoid permanent dental problems arising from malocclusive bite and misplaced permanent teeth that have not erupted.[3] Orthodontic treatment may be used to erupt permanent teeth that have been unable to descend due to lesions and cysts being in their path of eruption. Patients with orbital issues of diplopia, eye proptosis, and visual loss will require ophthalmologic treatment.[3]",

    "Disease": "Childhood dementia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "By their usual definitions, childhood dementias always cause global neurocognitive decline. In some childhood dementia conditions the child's early development is indistinguishable from their healthy peers, then slows or plateaus before declining. In other childhood dementia disorders, early development may be slower than typical before declining.[12]\nThis progressive decline causes difficulty concentrating, memory loss, confusion, and learning difficulties,[4] in addition to the loss of developmental skills acquired previously, such as: walking, talking, writing, reading, and playing.[4][13] Eventually the body loses its ability to function, leading to an early death.[12][4][13]\nOther symptoms and complications can occur depending on the subtype.[1]\nOther symptoms:\n• Behavioral changes: Changes in one's personality,[14] aggression, and hyperactivity.[5]\n• Motor decline: Loss of coordination[citation needed], balance[citation needed], and movement[4] abilities.\n• Seizures: Frequent in many forms of childhood dementia.[1][4]\nOther complications:\n• Loss of vision or hearing.[4]\n• Cardiovascular, respiratory, and/or digestive problems[4]\n• Bone or joint problems.[4]",
    "Cause": "The majority of childhood dementia cases are caused by genetic diseases.[1] More than 145 monogenic diseases have been identified that cause dementia with onset in childhood. Examples include lysosomal disorders such as Sanfilippo syndrome, Niemann-Pick disease type C and Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinoses (NCLs or Batten Disease), some mitochondrial diseases such as Leigh syndrome and peroxisomal disorders such as X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. Two-thirds of the cases can be attributed to inborn errors of metabolism.[1][15]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis typically involves a combination of biochemical testing and genetic testing, often performed around the age of four.

    "Disease": "Childhood granulomatous periorificial dermatitis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "CGPD is characterized by the presence of small, raised, dome-shaped, flesh-colored or yellow-brown papules primarily distributed around the mouth, eyes, and nose.[1] Affected children may also have papules on the ears, eyelids, cheeks, forehead, and nose.[1] CGPD skin lesions rarely affect areas of the skin other than the face.[1]",
    "Cause": "The cause of CGPD is unknown.[3]",
    "Diagnosis": "The approach to diagnosing CGPD is controversial.[2] Certain dermatologists suggest that ruling out infectious and allergic causes of similar skin eruptions and a skin biopsy demonstrating features consistent with CGPD is adequate for diagnosis. In contrast, other dermatologists advocate for performing a complete history and physical examination and obtaining laboratories and appropriate imaging to rule out cutaneous sarcoidosis.[2] On microscopy, non-tuberculous granulomas with surrounding lymphocytes clustered around hair follicles may be seen; additionally, infiltrates of epithelioid macrophages, lymphocytes, and giant cells may also be seen.[2][3]\nSeveral conditions exhibit skin findings similar to those of CGPD. These conditions include perioral dermatitis, acne vulgaris, granulomatous rosacea, contact dermatitis, folliculitis, atopic dermatitis, cheilitis, medication-induced acneiform eruptions, lupus miliaris disseminatus faciei, benign cephalic histiocytosis, granulosis rubra nasi, xanthomas, zinc deficiency, glucagonoma, cutaneous sarcoidosis, and scabies.[2][3]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment recommendations for CGPD vary and may include observation without treatment, stopping the use of topical corticosteroids, and the use of topical or oral antibiotics as well as isotretinoin.[2] Topical antibiotics such as metronidazole and erythromycin have been used for CGPD.[2] Oral antibiotics of the tetracycline class such as minocycline, doxycycline, and tetracycline have been recommended for CGPD.[1] Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole has also been used.[2] The use of oral systemic antibiotics is limited by side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity of the skin to sunlight.[1] Tetracycline antibiotics are not recommended for children under the age of 8 since tetracyclines are known to deposit in teeth (thereby staining them) and impair bone growth in children.[1]\nThe use of calcineurin inhibitor creams such as tacrolimus or pimecrolimus on the skin is controversial and results have been mixed.[1] Certain studies found the use of topical calcineurin inhibitors led to resolution of CGPD whereas others saw incomplete resolution or prolonged symptoms.[1] Topical azelaic acid has been used successfully to treat CGPD.[1] Immediate discontinuation of topical corticosteroids is recommended since corticosteroids are thought to worsen CGPD.[2]",

    "Disease": "Chorea-acanthocytosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "There are multiple symptoms that can help this disease to be diagnosed, this disease is marked by the presence of acanthocytes in blood (these acanthocytes can sometimes be absent or even make a late appearance in the course of the disease.)[9] and neurodegeneration causing a choreiform movement disorder.[10]\nAnother one of them would be that this disease should be considered in patients who have elevated levels of acanthocytes in a peripheral blood film.[citation needed]\nThe serum creatine kinase is often elevated in the body of the people who are affected by this disease.[6]\nChoreoacanthocytosis patients may have a \"rubber man\" appearance with truncal instability and sudden, violent trunk spasms. Patients develop generalized chorea and a minority of Choreoacanthocytosis patients develops Parkinsonism.[11]\nIn a least one third of patients, seizures, typically generalized, are the first manifestation of disease. Impairment of memory and executive functions is frequent, although not invariable.[11]\nPeople afflicted by this disease also experience a loss of neurons. Loss of neurons is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases. Due to the generally non-regenerative nature of neuronal cells in the adult central nervous system, this results in an irreversible and fatal process of neurodegeneration.[10] There is also the presence of several movement related disorders including chorea, dystonia and bradykinesia, one of the more incapacitating ones includes Truncal spasms.[7]",
    "Cause": "Choreo-acanthocytosis is caused by a mutation in both copies of the gene VPS13A, which codes for vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 13A.[12]",
    "Diagnosis": "Protein function tests that demonstrate a reduce in chorein levels and also genetic analysis can confirm the diagnosis given to a patient. For a disease like this it is often necessary to sample the blood of the patient on multiple occasions with a specific request given to the haematologist to examine the film for acanthocytes.[6] Another point is that the diagnosis of the disease can be confirmed by the absence of chorein in the western blot of the erythrocyte membranes.[10]",
    "Treatment": "The treatment to battle the disease chorea-acanthocytosis is completely symptomatic. For example, botulinum toxin injections can help to control orolingual dystonia.[6]\nDeep brain stimulation is a treatment that has varied effects on the people suffering from the symptoms of this disease, for some it has helped in a large way and for other people it did not help whatsoever, it is more effective on specific symptoms of the disease.[7] Patients with chorea-acanthocytosis should undergo a cardiac evaluation every five years to look for cardiomyopathy.[citation needed]",

    "Disease": "Citrullinemia type I",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of CTLN1 in infants are caused by increasing levels of ammonia in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid and include excessive vomiting, anorexia, refusal to eat, irritability, increased intracranial pressure, and worsening lethargy, seizures, hypotonia, respiratory distress, hepatomegaly, and cerebral edema. These symptoms appear within days of birth in the more severe forms of the disease with complete deficiency of the enzyme. As ammonia accumulates further, the affected infant may enter a hyperammonemic coma, which indicates neurological damage and can cause developmental delays, cognitive disabilities, cerebral palsy, hypertonia, spasticity, ankle clonus, seizures, and liver failure.[2]\nMilder forms of the disease are caused by partial arginosuccinate synthetase deficiency and may manifest in childhood or in adulthood. Symptoms of mild CTLN1 include failure to thrive, avoidance of high-protein foods, ataxia, worsening lethargy, and vomiting. Hyperammonemic coma can still develop in these people.[2] CTLN1 can also develop in the perinatal period.[3]",
    "Cause": "N/A",

Other diseases that may appear similar to CTLN1 include the organic acidemias and citrin deficiency. To diagnose CTLN1, a blood test for citrulline and ammonia levels can indicate the correct diagnosis; high levels of both are indicative of this disorder. Newborns are routinely screened for CTLN1 at birth. A genetic test is the only definitive way to diagnose it.[2]",
    "Treatment": "The main treatments for CTLN1 include a low-protein, high-calorie diet with amino acid supplements, particularly arginine. The Ucyclyd protocol, using buphenyl and ammonul, is used for treatment as well. Hyperammonemia is treated with hemodialysis; intravenous arginine, sodium benzoate, and sodium phenylacetate.

In 10% of cases, they are completely missing.[10] If the collarbones are completely missing or reduced to small vestiges, this allows hypermobility of the shoulders including ability to touch the shoulders together in front of the chest.[11] The defect is bilateral 80% of the time.[12] Partial collarbones may cause nerve damage symptoms and therefore have to be removed by surgery.\n• The mandible is prognathic due to hypoplasia of maxilla (micrognathism) and other facial bones.[11]\n• A soft spot or larger soft area in the top of the head where the fontanelle failed to close, or the fontanelle closes late.\n• Bones and joints are underdeveloped. People are shorter and their frames are smaller than their siblings who do not have the condition.\n• The permanent teeth include supernumerary teeth. Unless these supernumeraries are removed they will crowd the adult teeth in what already may be an underdeveloped jaw. If so, the supernumeraries will probably need to be removed to make space for the adult teeth. Up to 13 supernumerary teeth have been observed. Teeth may also be displaced. Cementum formation may be deficient.[13]\n• Failure of eruption of permanent teeth.\n• Bossing (bulging) of the forehead.\n• Open skull sutures, large fontanelles.\n• Hypertelorism.\n• Delayed ossification of bones forming symphysis pubis, producing a widened symphysis.\n• Coxa vara can occur, limiting abduction and causing Trendelenburg gait.\n• Short middle fifth phalanges,[14] sometimes causing short and wide fingers.[15]\n• Vertebral abnormalities.[14]\n• On rare occasions, brachial plexus irritation can occur.[10]\n• Scoliosis, spina bifida and syringomyelia have also been described.[10]\n• Wide nasal bridge\n• Crooked teeth\n• Increased risk of flat foot and knee deformities\n• High risk of hearing loss caused by infections\n• Decreased bone density, resulting in increased risk of fractures[16]\nOther features are: parietal  bossing, basilar invagination (atlantoaxial impaction), persistent metopic suture, abnormal ear structures with hearing loss, supernumerary ribs, hemivertebrae with spondylosis,  small and high scapulae, hypoplasia of illiac bones, absence of the pubic bone, short / absent fibular bones, short / absent  radial bones, hypoplastic terminal phalanges.[17]",

    "Disease": "Cockayne syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "N/A",
    "Cause": "If hyperoxia or excess oxygen occurs in the body, the cellular metabolism produces several highly reactive forms of oxygen called free radicals. This can cause oxidative damage to cellular components including the DNA. In normal cells, our body repairs the damaged sections. In the case of this disease, due to subtle defects in transcription, children's genetic machinery for synthesizing proteins needed by the body does not operate at normal capacity. Over time, went this theory, results in developmental failure and death. Every minute, the body pumps 10 to 20 liters of oxygen through the blood, carrying it to billions of cells in our bodies. In its normal molecular form, oxygen is harmless. However, cellular metabolism involving oxygen can generate several highly reactive free radicals. These free radicals can cause oxidative damage to cellular components including the DNA. In an average human cell, several thousand lesions occur in the DNA every day. Many of these lesions result from oxidative damage. Each lesion—a damaged section of DNA—must be snipped out and the DNA repaired to preserve its normal function. Unrepaired DNA can lose its ability to code for proteins. Mutations also can result. These mutations can activate oncogenes or silence tumor suppressor genes. According to research, oxidative damage to active genes is not preferentially repaired, and in the most severe cases, the repair is slowed throughout the whole genome. The resulting accumulation of oxidative damage could impair the normal functions of the DNA and may even result in triggering a program of cell death (apoptosis). The children with this disease do not repair the active genes where oxidative damage occurs. Normally, oxidative damage repair is faster in the active genes (which make up less than five percent of the genome) than in inactive regions of the DNA. The resulting accumulation of oxidative damage could impair the normal functions of the DNA and may even result in triggering a program of cell death (apoptosis).[12]",
    "Diagnosis": "People with this syndrome have smaller than normal head sizes (microcephaly), are of short stature (dwarfism), their eyes appear sunken, and they have an \"aged\" look. They often have long limbs with joint contractures (inability to relax the muscle at a joint), a hunched back (kyphosis), and they may be very thin (cachetic), due to a loss of subcutaneous fat. Their small chin, large ears, and pointy, thin nose often give an aged appearance.[9]\nThe skin of those with Cockayne syndrome is also frequently affected: hyperpigmentation, varicose or spider veins (telangiectasia),[9] and serious sensitivity to sunlight are common, even in individuals without XP-CS. Often patients with Cockayne Syndrome will severely burn or blister with very little heat exposure.\nThe eyes of patients can be affected in various ways and eye abnormalities are common in CS. Cataracts and cloudiness of the cornea (corneal opacity) are common. The loss of and damage to the nerves of the optic nerve, causing optic atrophy, can occur.[3] Nystagmus, or involuntary eye movement, and pupils that fail to dilate demonstrate a loss of control of voluntary and involuntary muscle movement.[9] A salt and pepper retinal pigmentation is also a typical sign.\nDiagnosis is determined by a specific test for DNA repair, which measures the recovery of RNA after exposure to UV radiation. Despite being associated with genes involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER), unlike xeroderma pigmentosum, CS is not associated with an increased risk of cancer.[6]",
    "Treatment": "There is no cure for this syndrome, although patients can be symptomatically treated. Treatment usually involves physical therapy and minor surgeries to the affected organs, such as cataract removal.[3] Also wearing high-factor sunscreen and protective clothing is recommended because Cockayne Syndrome patients are very sensitive to UV radiation.[21] Optimal nutrition can also help. Genetic counseling for the parents is recommended, as the disorder has a 25% chance of being passed to any future children, and prenatal testing is also a possibility.[3] Another important aspect is the prevention of recurrence of CS in other siblings. Identification of gene defects involved makes it possible to offer genetic counseling and antenatal\ndiagnostic testing to the parents who already have one affected child.[22]\nCurrently, there are two ongoing projects focused on the development of gene therapy for Cockayne syndrome. The first project, led by the Viljem Julijan Association for Children with Rare Diseases, aims to develop gene therapy specifically for Cockayne syndrome type B.[23] The second project, led by the Riaan Research Initiative, is dedicated to the development of gene therapy for Cockayne syndrome type A.[24]",

    "Disease": "Congenital hyperinsulinism",
    "Signs and symptoms": "As HI is a congenital condition, an infant usually starts to show signs and symptoms within the first few days of life, although very occasionally symptoms may appear later in life. It is often difficult to identify signs and symptoms of HI because they are often confused with the typical behaviours of newborns and infants.[18] About 60% of babies with HI develop hypoglycemia during the first month of life. An additional 30% will be diagnosed later in the first year and some later in life.[5]\nHI may present in several ways; common symptoms of hypoglycemia include:\n• Irritability[19][20]\n• Lethargy (excessive sleepiness)[21][20]\n• Jitteriness/tremors[21][22][19][20]\n• Tachycardia or bradycardia[23]\n• Abnormal breathing patterns/apnoea[19][20]\n• Hypothermia[21][19][20]\n• Abnormal feeding behaviour (not waking for feeds, not sucking effectively, appearing unsettled and demanding very frequent feeds, especially after a period of feeding well)[21][19][20]\n• High-pitched cry[21]\n• Hypotonia (Loose/floppy muscles)[21][19][20]\n• Pale/pallor/cyanosis (bluish coloured skin)[19]\n• Sweating[22][20]\nOlder children and adults' symptoms may also include headaches, confusion, and dizziness.[23]\nParents often describe initial concerns or symptoms such as their infants \"not feeding well, being sleepy and jittery\".[5]\nMore severe symptoms, such as seizures (fits or convulsions), can occur with a prolonged or extremely low blood sugar level.[24][22][19][20] If the blood sugar level is not corrected, it can lead to loss of consciousness and potential brain injury.[24]\nA simple blood sugar measurement is essential if there are any symptoms of hypoglycaemia.[25]",
    "Cause": "Hyperinsulinism or congenital hyperinsulinism can be a genetic or acquired condition. Acquired HI may be secondary to factors around birth, such as growth restriction of the fetus, less oxygen to the baby, or maternal diabetes. Together, these are often called perinatal stress-induced HI. They are typically present in the first 24 hours of life but often resolve by two weeks of age.[17][26]\nIn contrast to the resolving perinatal stress-induced low blood sugars, HI can also be due to a genetic cause. Therefore, genetic testing should be considered in children in whom acquired HI is unlikely. This typically includes those not responding to first-line medication diazoxide. A genetic cause is also possible in children responding to diazoxide but where low sugars persist beyond the first 4 months of life.[6][27]\nThere are many different genetic forms of HI which can be present in isolation or as part of a wider condition, called a syndrome.[28]",
    "Diagnosis": "HI is due to dysregulation of the secretion of the hormone insulin from beta-cells in the pancreas. Insulin is present in the blood at the time of hypoglycemia rather than being suppressed. This can be difficult to measure due to fluctuation in insulin levels. The diagnosis of HI is made based on increased insulin action and/or inadequate suppression of plasma insulin during a time of hypoglycemia. Increased insulin action can be demonstrated by increased glucose requirement (e.g., > 8 mg/kg/minute in a newborn compared to normal of 4-6 mg/kg/minute.[39] Another sign of excess insulin action is suppressed blood levels of free fatty acids and ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate) during hypoglycemia. The clinical diagnosis is also supported by a large blood glucose rise after glucagon administration at the time of hypoglycemia.[40][41][42] Glucagon is another hormone secreted from the pancreas that opposes insulin action and stimulates the release of glucose from liver glycogen stores. Measurement of insulin, c-peptide (which is co-secreted with insulin) free fatty acids and ketones together with a glucagon stimulation test can be performed during the spontaneous time of hypoglycemia or during hypoglycemia induced by a period of supervised and monitored fasting. In newborn infants, there is a time of transitional hypoglycaemia due to hyperinsulinism for the first after birth 72 hours. Hence the clinical diagnosis is best established after 72 hours of age.[28] Assessing blood ammonia and acylcarnitine profile, urinary metabolic profiles, in addition to provocative responses to protein and amino acids (leucine) may be helpful in defining the subtype of HI.[43][44][45][46]",
    "Treatment": "The goal of treatment in hyperinsulinism is to prevent hypoglycemia-induced brain damage, thus, the goal of therapy is to maintain the blood sugar level in the normal range [>70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L)]. The first step is the restoration of blood sugar level to the normal range after acute hypoglycemia, followed by the prevention of recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia, which is common in congenital hyperinsulinism. This is best accomplished with intravenous dextrose initially.\nOnce the diagnosis of HI has been established, including determination of the genotype and phenotype, whenever possible, specific treatment should be initiated. Some of the following measures are often tried:\nDiazoxide, a KATP channel opener, that inhibits insulin secretion by binding to the sulfonylurea 1 (SUR1) component of the KATP channel, is the only drug with regulatory approval for the treatment of HI and the first-line of therapy for this condition.[48] To prevent complications from diazoxide-induced fluid retention, diuretic therapy is typically initiated concomitantly with diazoxide. Dose selection and dose escalation should be carefully considered weighing the response and potential for side effects. Because of its long half-life, it may take up to 5 days to achieve a full therapeutic effect. An important next step is the assessment of the responsiveness to diazoxide, which has important diagnostic and therapeutic implications. Responsiveness to diazoxide is defined by the demonstration that the cardinal feature of HI, hypoketotic hypoglycemia, is corrected by treatment. This is best assessed by a fasting test demonstrating that the child can fast for 12-18 hours with plasma glucose ≥ 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) or that plasma betahydroxybutyrate increases to > 1.8 mmol/L before plasma glucose decreases below 50-60 mg/dL (2.8-3.3 mmol/L) during fasting. Lack of responsiveness to diazoxide suggests the possibility that the HI is due to inactivating mutation(s) in the genes encoding the KATP channels which accounts for up to 90% of cases of diazoxide-unresponsive HI. For these cases, rapid genetic testing of the genes ABCC8 and KCNJ11 is critical to determine the likelihood of focal HI.[30]\nSurgery is the treatment of choice for focal HI, but before surgery, it is important to localize the lesion. These lesions are not visible using conventional imaging techniques such as ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scan, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) However, specialized imaging using 18-F-L 3,4 dihydroxyphenylalanine (18F DOPA) positron emission tomography (PET) scan is almost 100% accurate in localizing a focal lesion.[49] Expert assessment of the pancreatic histology during surgery using frozen biopsies and surgical expertise are key for the success of the surgery. The reported cure rate for focal HI is 97%.[12]\nFor non-focal diazoxide-unresponsive cases, treatment options are limited. Off-label use of the somatostatin analogue octreotide has been the long-standing second line of treatment for HI,[50] but its effectiveness is limited by the development of tachyphylaxis. It is important to note that in countries where diazoxide is not available, octreotide may be the first line of therapy. Because of its association with potentially fatal necrotizing enterocolitis, octreotide use in very young infants should be carefully considered weighting the risk versus the potential benefits.[51] Octreotide is administrated as a subcutaneous injection typically every 6 hours but it can also be administrated continuously through a subcutaneous pump. Long-acting somatostatin analogues, octreotide LAR (administrated intramuscularly) and lanreotide (administered as a deep subcutaneous injection), are convenient options for older children. An alternative treatment approach for diazoxide-unresponsive cases that are either not eligible or unresponsive to somatostatin analogues is the use of a continuous infusion of dextrose through a gastrostomy tube.[52]",

    "Cause": "CIP is caused by extremely rare genetic disorders.[2] Roughly 50% of CIP cases are inherited from a parent with CIP.[6] Of the five HSAN disorders, HSAN II, III, IV, and V are inherited via an autosomal recessive pattern, while HSAN I is inherited via an autosomal dominant pattern.[1] The breakdown of specific genetic mutation types among those diagnosed with CIP is unknown as of 2020.[4] HSAN IV, one of the more common forms of CIP, is caused by a mutation in the NTRK1 gene (also known as TrkA).[4]",

This protein induces outgrowth of axons and dendrites and promotes the survival of embryonic sensory and sympathetic neurons. The mutation in NTRK1 does not allow NGF to bind properly, causing defects in the development and function of nociceptive reception.[3]\nMitochondrial abnormalities in muscle cells have been found in people with CIPA. Skin biopsies show a lack of innervation of the eccrine glands[4] and nerve biopsies show a lack of small myelinated and unmyelinated fibers.[4][8][3]",

If the zygote division occurs after two weeks of the development of the embryonic disc, it results in the formation of conjoined twins.[10]\n• fusion of two fertilized eggs occurs early in development.\nPartial splitting of the primitive node and streak may result in the formation of conjoined twins. These twins are classified according to the nature and degree of their union. Occasionally, monozygotic twins are connected only by a common skin bridge or by a common liver bridge. The type of twins formed depends on when and to what extent abnormalities of the node and streak occurred. Misexpression of genes, such as goosecoid, may also result in conjoined twins.[11] Goosecoid activates inhibitors of BMP4 and contributes to regulation of head development. Over- or underexpression of this gene in laboratory animals results in severe malformations of the head region, including duplications, similar to some types of conjoined twins.[12]",

    "Disease": "Corticobasal degeneration",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Because CBD is progressive, a standard set of diagnostic criteria can be used, which is centred on the disease's evolution.  Included in these fundamental features are problems with cortical processing, dysfunction of the basal ganglia, and a sudden and detrimental onset.[2]  Psychiatric and cognitive dysfunctions, although present in CBD, are much less prevalent and lack establishment as common indicators of the presence of the disease.[3]\nAlthough corticobasal degeneration has a plethora of symptoms, some are more prevalent than others. In a study of 147 patients with CBD, it was found that all of them had at least one Parkinsonian sign, 95% having two and 93% had some higher order dysfunction (cognitive impairments like acalculia, sensory loss, dementia, neglect, etc.). In a separate study of 14 patients recorded 3 years after the onset of symptoms, many patients had high numbers of motor symptoms. 71% had bradykinesia (slow movements), 64% showed apraxia, 43% reported limb dystonia, and although more cognitive 36% had dementia. In another study of 36, over half had a useless/alien arm and 27% had a gait impediment[21]. From this, we can see why CBD is hard to diagnose.

    "Treatment": "Because the exact cause of CBD is unknown, there is no formal treatment for the disease.  Instead, treatments focus on minimizing the appearance or effect of symptoms. The most easily treatable symptom of CBD is parkinsonism, most commonly treated with dopaminergic drugs.  However, there is usually only moderate improvement, and the relief from the symptom is not long-lasting.  In addition, palliative therapies, including the use of wheelchairs, speech therapy, and feeding techniques, are often used to alleviate many of the symptoms that are not improved by medication.[17]\nMany treatments have low success rates or have not been tested thoroughly or produced frequently. For example, in relation to the motor aspect of disability, CBD has high resistance against treatments to improve dopamine intake, such as levodopa. A number of studies have reported no real levels of improvement based on similar drugs/dopaminergic agonists. Because of the brain's levels of inhibition, some medications have focused on creating an inhibition that would negate the effect. Many of these relaxants and anticonvulsants have some success but also have unwanted side effects[21][clarification needed].\nCognitive and associative effects of CBD are also hard to treat as the effects of many of the treatments for the symptomatic conditions that ensue such as dementia, aphasia, neglect, and apraxia are not well understood.[citation needed]",

However, it is important to distinguish this population from CFND for research purposes. On the other hand, especially in males, it is possible that someone is a carrier of the EFNB1 gene mutation yet does not present with any physical manifestations.[14][15]\nGenetic counseling or prenatal screening may be advised if there is a reason to suspect the presence of an EFNB1 gene mutation.[3][5] Prenatal screening may be done by performing an ultrasound, where can be searched specifically for hypertelorism or a bifid nasal tip. However, this is quite difficult as facial involvement may not be obvious at such an early age, especially in cases with mild phenotypic presentation.[7] The most definitive way to prove the presence of CFND is done by genetic testing, through amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling. This however carries a greater risk of premature termination of the pregnancy.[16]",

Facial bipartition is the preferable choice as there are less additional corrections needed, as well as providing a more stable long-term result after treatment.[18] After the correction of the orbitas, the medial corners of the eyes are put more into a horizontal line.[7]\n• Nasal deformity correction: The correction of the broad nasal base is simultaneously done with the orbital hypertelorism repair.

    "Disease": "Creatine transporter defect",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Generally, the majority of individuals with creatine transporter defect express the following symptoms with varying levels of severity: developmental delay and regression, intellectual disability, and abnormalities in expressive and cognitive speech.[5] However, several studies have shown a wider variety of symptoms including, but not limited to attention deficit and hyperactivity with impulsivity, myopathy, hypotonia, semantic-pragmatic language disorder, oral dyspraxia, extrapyramidal movement disorder, constipation, absent speech development, seizures, and epilepsy.[6][2][3][7] Furthermore, symptoms can significantly vary between hemizygous males and heterozygous females, although, symptoms are generally more severe in hemizygous males. Hemizygous males more commonly express seizures, growth deficiency, severe intellectual disability, and severe expressive language impairment.[2][3] Heterozygous females more commonly express mild intellectual disability, impairments to confrontational naming and verbal memory, and learning and behavior problems.[6][2][8]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of CTD is usually suspected based on the clinical presentation of intellectual disability, abnormalities in cognitive and expressive speech, and developmental delay. Furthermore, a family history of X-linked intellectual disability, developmental coordination disorder, and seizures is strongly suggestive.[14] Initial screening of CTD involves obtaining a urine sample and measuring the ratio of creatine to creatinine. If the ratio of creatine to creatinine is greater than 1.5, then the presence of CTD is highly likely. This is because a large ratio indicates a high amount of creatine in the urine.[7][15] This, in turn, indicates inadequate transport of creatine into the brain and muscle. However, the urine screening test often fails in diagnosing heterozygous females. Studies have demonstrated that as a group heterozygous females have significantly decreased cerebral creatine concentration, but that individual heterozygous females often have normal creatine concentrations found in their urine. Therefore, urine screening tests are unreliable as a standard test for diagnosing CTD, particularly in females.[8]\nA more reliable and sophisticated manner of testing for cerebral creatine concentrations is through in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS). In vivo 1H MRS uses proton signals to determine the concentration of specific metabolites. This method of testing is more reliable because it provides a fairly accurate measurement of the amount of creatine inside the brain. Similar to urine testing, a drawback of using 1H MRS as a test for CTD is that the results of the test could be attributed to any of the cerebral creatine deficiencies.[15] The most accurate and reliable method of testing for CTD is through DNA sequence analysis of SLC6A8. DNA analysis of SLC6A8 allows the identification of the location and type of variant causing the cerebral creatine deficiency. Furthermore, DNA analysis of SLC6A8 is able to prove that a cerebral creatine deficiency is due to CTD and not GAMT or AGAT deficiency.[4][7][8]",
    "Treatment": "CTD is difficult to treat because the transporter responsible for transporting creatine to the brain and muscles is defective. Affected individuals have sufficient amounts of creatine, but it cannot get to the tissues where it is needed. Studies in which oral creatine monohydrate supplements were given to patients with CTD found that patients did not respond to treatment.[16]  Patients with CTD are unresponsive to oral creatine monohydrate supplements because regardless of the amount of creatine they ingest, the creatine transporter is still defective, and therefore creatine is incapable of being transported across the BBB.[15][17] Therapeutic approaches that are currently in development include dodecyl creatine ester (DCE) for intranasal creatine delivery, pharmacochaperones to aid in rescuing misfolded transporter, and gene therapy to compensate for the mutated SLC6A8 gene.[16]",

    "Disease": "Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The first symptom of CJD is usually rapidly progressive dementia, leading to memory loss, personality changes, and hallucinations. Myoclonus (jerky movements) typically occurs in 90% of cases, but may be absent at initial onset.[15] Other frequently occurring features include anxiety, depression, paranoia, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and psychosis.[16] This is accompanied by physical problems such as speech impairment, balance and coordination dysfunction (ataxia), changes in gait, and rigid posture. In most people with CJD, these symptoms are accompanied by involuntary movements. Rarely, unusual symptoms like the alien limb phenomenon have been observed.[17] The duration of the disease varies greatly, but sporadic (non-inherited) CJD can be fatal within months or even weeks.[18] Most affected people die six months after initial symptoms appear, often of pneumonia due to impaired coughing reflexes. About 15% of people with CJD survive for two or more years.[19]\nThe symptoms of CJD are caused by the progressive death of the brain's nerve cells, which are associated with the build-up of abnormal prion proteins forming in the brain. When brain tissue from a person with CJD is examined under a microscope, many tiny holes can be seen where the nerve cells have died. Parts of the brain may resemble a sponge where the prions were infecting the areas of the brain.[20]",
    "Cause": "CJD is a type of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE), which is caused by prions.[8] Prions are misfolded proteins that occur in the neurons of the central nervous system (CNS). The CJD prion is dangerous because it promotes refolding of cellular prion proteins into the diseased state.[21] The number of misfolded protein molecules will increase exponentially, and the process leads to a large quantity of insoluble proteins in affected cells. This mass of misfolded proteins disrupts neuronal cell function and causes cell death. Mutations in the gene for the prion protein can cause a misfolding of the dominantly alpha helical regions into beta pleated sheets. This change in conformation disables the protein's ability to undergo digestion. Once the prion is transmitted, the defective proteins invade the brain and induce other prion protein molecules to misfold in a self-sustaining feedback loop. These neurodegenerative diseases are commonly called prion diseases.[22]\nPrPC, the normal fibril cellular proteins responsible for a wide range of CNS functions, are misfolded by what current research suggests are small, highly neurotoxic oligomeric aggregates, known as PrPSc, which interact with cell surfaces to disrupt neuronal function.[23] The binding of prion oligomers to normal prion protein on neurons may trigger toxic signals similar to how oligomeric β-amyloid causes synaptic damage in Alzheimer’s disease.[23] Different conformations of PrPSc (often termed prion “strains”) are thought to cause the distinct subtypes of prion disease, explaining variations in clinical features and progression.[24] They are thought to affect signaling processes, damaging neurons and resulting in degeneration that causes the spongiform appearance in the affected brain.[25] Other forms of TSEs that are found in humans are Gerstmann–Sträussler–Scheinker syndrome, fatal familial insomnia, kuru, and variably protease-sensitive prionopathy.[26] Susceptibility and disease phenotype are influenced by a common polymorphism at codon 129 of the PRNP gene (methionine/valine). Notably, individuals homozygous at codon 129 are over-represented in sporadic CJD cases and tend to have shorter incubation periods.[27]",
    "Diagnosis": "Testing for CJD has historically been problematic, due to the nonspecific nature of early symptoms and difficulty in safely obtaining brain tissue for confirmation. The diagnosis may initially be suspected in a person with rapidly progressing dementia, particularly when it is also found with the characteristic medical signs and symptoms such as involuntary muscle jerking,[41] difficulty with coordination/balance and walking, and visual disturbances.[4] Further testing can support the diagnosis and may include:\n• Electroencephalography – may have a characteristic generalized periodic sharp wave pattern. Periodic sharp wave complexes develop in half of the people with sporadic CJD, particularly in the later stages.[2]\n• Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis for elevated levels of 14-3-3 protein and tau protein could be supportive in the diagnosis of sCJD. The two proteins are released into the CSF by damaged nerve cells. Increased levels of tau or 14-3-3 proteins are seen in 90% of prion diseases. The markers have a specificity of 95% in clinical symptoms suggestive of CJD, but specificity is 70% in other, less characteristic cases.[42] 14-3-3 and tau proteins may also be elevated in the CSF after ischemic strokes, inflammatory brain diseases, or seizures.[42] The protein markers are also less specific in early CJD, genetic CJD or the bovine variant.[42] However, a positive result should not be regarded as sufficient for the diagnosis.[43][44][45] The real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assay, which amplifies misfolded PrPSc, now plays a central role in CJD diagnosis. Second-generation RT-QuIC on cerebrospinal fluid has sensitivity in the 90–97% range and ~100% specificity in sporadic CJD,[27] far superior to earlier CSF tests. A positive RT-QuIC (on CSF or other tissues) is now included as a criterion for probable CJD in many national surveillance centers.[27] Studies have shown RT-QuIC can also be done on olfactory mucosa swabs obtained via nasal brushing and on skin biopsies, with high diagnostic accuracy (reported sensitivities ~90–100%).[27]\n• MRI with diffusion weighted inversion (DWI) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) shows a high signal intensity in certain parts of the cortex (a cortical ribboning appearance), the basal ganglia, and the thalami.[42] The most common presenting patterns are simultaneous involvement of the cortex and striatum (60% of cases), cortical involvement without the striatum (30%), thalamus (21%), cerebellum (8%) and striatum without cortical involvement (7%). In populations with a rapidly progressive dementia (early in the disease process), MRI has a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 97% for diagnosing CJD.[46] The MRI changes characteristic of CJD may also be seen in the immediate aftermath (hours after the event) of autoimmune encephalitis or focal seizures.[42]\nIn recent years, studies have shown that the tumour marker neuron-specific enolase (NSE) is often elevated in CJD cases; however, its diagnostic utility is seen primarily when combined with a test for the 14-3-3 protein.[47] As of 2010[update], screening tests to identify infected asymptomatic individuals, such as blood donors, are not yet available, though methods have been proposed and evaluated.[48]",
    "Treatment": "As of 2025, there is no cure or effective treatment for CJD.[72] Some of the symptoms, like twitching, can be managed, but otherwise treatment is palliative care.[72] Psychiatric symptoms like anxiety and depression can be treated with sedatives and antidepressants. Myoclonic jerks can be handled with clonazepam or sodium valproate. Opiates can help with pain.[73] Seizures are very uncommon but can nevertheless be treated with antiepileptic drugs.[74]\nIn 2022, results of an early-stage trial of PRN100, a monoclonal antibody against PrP, were reported: the drug appeared safe and reached the brain, but treated patients did not show clearly improved survival compared to historical controls. While not curative, this trial demonstrated the feasibility of immunotherapy for prion disease.[75]",

    "Signs and symptoms": "It is characterised by skin that is loose, hanging, wrinkled, and lacking in elasticity. The loose skin can be either generalised or localised.[4] Biopsies have shown reduction and degeneration of dermal elastic fibres in the affected areas of skin.[5] The loose skin is often most noticeable on the face, resulting in a prematurely aged appearance. The affected areas of skin may be thickened and dark. In addition, the joints may be loose (hypermobile) because of lax ligaments and tendons. When cutis laxa is severe, it can also affect the internal organs. The lungs, heart (supravalvular pulmonary stenosis), intestines, or arteries may be affected with a variety of severe impairments. In some cases, hernias and outpouching of the bladder can be observed. Patients can also present with whites of the eyes that are blue.[citation needed]",
    "Cause": "In many cases, cutis laxa is inherited. Autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked recessive forms have been described, but acquired forms also occur.[citation needed]\nCutis laxa is associated with deficient or absent elastin fibers in the extracellular matrix.[6] This can be related to decreased elastin synthesis or structural defects in the extracellular matrix.[7]\nCutis laxa may be caused by mutations in the genes: ELN,[8] ATP6V0A2,[9]\nATP7A,[10] FBLN4,[11] FBLN5,[12] and PYCR1.[13] A related neurocutaneous syndrome may be caused by mutations in the gene ALDH18A1 (P5CS).[14] Cutis laxa may also be seen in association with inherited connective tissue disorders such as Ehlers–Danlos syndromes. Another syndrome associated with cutis laxa is Lenz-Majewski syndrome which is due to a mutation in the phosphatidylserine synthase 1 (PTDSS1) gene. [citation needed]\nIn contrast, acquired cutis laxa often has a triggering event such as urticaria, drugs (such as penicillin) or neoplasms.[15] Acquired cutis laxa may also be immunologically mediated, as it can involve dermal deposit of immunoglobulins and it can occur with autoimmune diseases.[5] Acquired cutis laxa has been associated with granular immunoglobulin A deposits as well as abundant neutrophils.[5] One hypothesis for the cause is excessive elastase release from neutrophils and macrophages.[15] It has also been considered that mutations in elastin (ELN) and fibulin-5 (FBLN5) genes can increase susceptibility of elastic fibres to inflammatory degradation in acquired cutis laxa.[15]\nAcquired cutis laxa has also been seen in conjunction with a number of conditions including: rheumatoid arthritis,[16] systemic lupus erythematosus,[17] celiac disease,[5] and monoclonal gammopathies.[18] It can also occur as a postinflammatory response after urticaria.[19] Urticarial skin fibroblasts have shown a 2- to 3- fold increase in elastase activity in a patient with acquired cutis laxa.[20]",

Some children may have low self-esteem due to the condition. CMTC is an uncommon, sporadic congenital vascular malformation characterized by a generalized or localized reticulated cutaneous vascular network.[citation needed]\nCutaneous lesions described in patients with CMTC include nevus flammeus, hemangioma, nevus anemicus, café-au-lait spots, melanocytic nevus, aplasia cutis and acral cyanosis.[5]\nIt has a marbled bluish to deep-purple appearance. The dark skin lesions often show a palpable loss of dermal substance. The reticulated mottling frequently appears more prominent in a cold environment (physiologic cutis marmorata), but tends not to disappear with warming. Hence, the erythema may be worsened by cooling, physical activity, or crying. CMTC frequently involves the extremities, with the lower extremities involved most commonly, followed by the upper extremities, and then the trunk and face. The lower extremities often show atrophy and seldom show hypertrophy resulting in limb circumference discrepancy.[citation needed]\nWhen located on the trunk, the lesions of CMTC tend to show mosaic distribution in streaks with a sharp midline demarcation seen across the abdomen.[5] The lesions are primarily localized, but can be segmental or generalized, often unilateral in appearance.[5] Diffuse involvement of the skin is usually not observed.\nAlthough its course is variable, the majority of lesions in mild cases fade by adolescence. Ulceration and secondary infection are complications in severe cases and can be fatal if present in the neonatal period.[6]",
    "Cause": "Fewer than 100 cases of CMTC have been published worldwide. Petrozzi reported the first case of CMTC in the United States in 1970.[7] CMTC is believed to be more common than suspected, as studies have shown that milder forms of the disease are not being recognized as CMTC.[5]\nThe pathophysiology is still unclear, with most cases occurring sporadically, although rare cases were reported in families. Studies indicated the primary involvement of capillaries, venules and veins, and possibly also that of arterioles and lymphatics.\nHypotheses that have been proposed include: environmental/external factors;[8] peripheral neural dysfunction; failure of the development of mesodermic vessels in an early embryonic stage; autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance and, finally, the theory of Happle.[9]",

    "Signs and symptoms": "The common symptoms of neutropenia are recurrent fever, malaise, inflammation of the tissues surrounding the teeth, mouth ulcers, inflammation and bacterial infection of the respiratory tract, digestive tract, skin, and abdominal pain.[1][2] It is considered that the greatest risk for death is from developing necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), peritonitis, bacteremia or Clostridium and Escherichia coli sepsis and septic shock, and pneumonia.[1][3][4]",
    "Cause": "Cyclic neutropenia (CyN), like severe congenital neutropenia (SCN), is a rare disorder. It is considered that in the general population, CyN has a frequency of one in one million.[1] It is the result of autosomal dominant mutation in ELANE gene located on the short arm (p) of chromosome 19 (19p13.3), the gene encoding neutrophil elastase, which is also the most common cause of the SCN.[1][5][6][7] It sporadically occurs as a de novo mutation variant or can be present among members of the same family.[1] In the case of CyN, the mutation variants have been found to mostly cluster in intron 4 and exon 4 and 5,[6][3] but were also located in intron 3, and exon 2 and 3.[8][9][10][11][12] Some mutation variants have been found in both Cyn and SCN, which indicates they are phenotypes of the same disease with different severity.[9]\nIt is considered that the mutation causes a decrease in the \"neutrophil production or excessive apoptosis (shorter half-life)\" which results in a deficiency of mature neutrophils in the blood.[13] The exact pathological mechanism is still researched, with the main hypotheses being mislocalization of ELANE or unfolded protein response (UPR) induced by mutant ELANE,[14] however according to Mehta et al. (2016), the \"UPR induction by mutant ELANE is not strong enough to promote cell death and that mutant ELANE causes SCN through an alternative mechanism\".[15] According to Garg et al. (2020), new \"findings challenge the currently prevailing model that SCN results from mutant ELANE, which triggers endoplasmic reticulum stress, UPR, and apoptosis\".[16] The expression of the ELANE gene has been linked to GFI1 gene,[8][17] and some considered that interaction with other genes causes the emergence and severity of one or the other phenotypic disorder.[9] It is unclear what causes the cyclic aspect in CyN.[17] According to Donadieu et al. (2011), the \"cyclic aspect ... suggests the existence of a cryptic biological clock that regulates granulopoiesis. This putative clock might be revealed by particular mutations\".[13] Michael Mackey \"postulates that the production of neutrophils is governed by long‐range stimulatory factors in a long feedback loop that has a built‐in time delay in the maturation of promyelocytes to fully differentiated neutrophils\".[18] It is also not clear what causes that the levels of secretory leucocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), which influences the induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR), are not diminished and as such activation of UPR is absent in CyN compared to SCN, in other words, different ELANE mutations \"have different effects on UPR activation, and SLPI regulates the extent of ELANE‐triggered UPR\".[19]\nA 2020 study published in Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences about the pathomechanism of CyN revealed that \"some HSPCs escape the UPR‐induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and proliferate in response to granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor (G‐CSF) to a certain threshold at which UPR again affects the majority of HSPCs. There is a cyclic balance between ER stress-induced apoptosis of HSPCs and compensatory G‐CSF–stimulated HSPC proliferation followed by granulocytic differentiation\"; in other words, CyN is \"characterized by cycling UPR activities and cycling UPR‐escaping cells\". Also, the most probable reason that from the same mutation variant develops SCN and not CyN is due to more severe damage caused by UPR stress in SCN.[18]",
    "Diagnosis": "A diagnosis is usually confirmed by monitoring absolute neutrophil (ANC) count three times per week for at least six weeks.[1][3] The confirmation can be assisted with Lomb periodogram.[20] During the condition, which lasts for three to six days and tends to occur approximately every three weeks (but can range from 14 to 36 days),[2][3] the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is less than 200-500 cells/μL (<0.2-0.5 billion/L), with increase of monocyte counts, and mild oscillations of other cells, including a mild anemia.[1][21] Between cycles the neutrophil count mostly peaks at subnormal or normal values.[17]\nGenetic testing is advised for mutations in the ELANE and other neutropenia related genes (like HAX1, G6PC3, GFI1 etc.) to differentiate it from other secondary causes and forms of neutropenia.[1][22] In some cases intervals and oscillations can be lower, making the ANC analysis insufficient,[1] and since both disorders can have the same mutation variants in ELANE it is preferable to have both ANC and genetic analysis to confirm in the diagnosis whether it is severe congenital or cyclic neutropenia.[21][20]",
    "Treatment": "Although individuals between cycles are generally healthy and symptoms tend to improve in adulthood, it is advised avoiding activities prone to injuries, to have regular oral and dental care,[2] and BCG vaccine to be avoided.[1][13] It is advised monitoring white blood cells several times a year. The treatment following the symptoms should be immediate to prevent infections, especially during a fever when it requires broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (see febrile neutropenia). The most important and often life-saving treatment is the preventive therapy of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), in the form of filgrastim, which regulates the production of neutrophils within the bone marrow, but shortens the neutropenic cycle to about 7-14 days and the duration of the severe condition.[1][17] The subcutaneous injections, with median dosage of 1.5 μg/kg/day,[18] can be given daily, intermittently once every three days, or timed to just treat the neutropenic period.[13][23] The therapy is considered to be \"safe and effective\", with no significant adverse effects,[24] besides a possibility of development of osteopenia.[21]\nThe granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is less effective with more adverse effects. Another alternative is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), but is usually practiced in SCN,[1] and in one case between two sibling donors, one of which was undergoing HSCT treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) while the second had CyN and whose marrow was transferred, was also transferred CyN through allogeneic marrow grafting. It shows that CyN is a stem cell disorder.[25] Yearly bone marrow examinations are not recommended.[23]",

    "Disease": "Cystic fibrosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Cystic fibrosis typically manifests early in life. Newborns and infants with cystic fibrosis tend to have frequent, large, greasy stools (a result of malabsorption) and are underweight for their age.[17]: Clinical Manifestations  Of newborns, 15–20% have their small intestine blocked by meconium, often requiring surgery to correct.[17]: Clinical Manifestations  Newborns occasionally have neonatal jaundice due to blockage of the bile ducts.[17]: Clinical Manifestations  Children with cystic fibrosis lose excessive salt in their sweat, and parents often notice salt crystallizing on the skin, or a salty taste when they kiss their child.[17]: Clinical Manifestations\nThe primary cause of morbidity and death in people with cystic fibrosis is progressive lung disease, which eventually leads to respiratory failure.[17]: Respiratory Tract  This typically begins as a prolonged respiratory infection that continues until treated with antibiotics.[17]: Respiratory Tract  Chronic infection of the respiratory tract is nearly universal in people with cystic fibrosis, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, fungi, and mycobacteria all becoming increasingly common over time.[18] Inflammation of the upper airway results in frequent runny nose and nasal obstruction. Nasal polyps are common, particularly in children and teenagers.[17]: Respiratory Tract  As the disease progresses, people tend to have shortness of breath, and a chronic cough that produces sputum.[17]: Biliary Tract  Breathing problems make it increasingly challenging to exercise, and prolonged illness causes those affected to be underweight for their age.[17]: Biliary Tract  In late adolescence or adulthood, people begin to develop severe signs of lung disease: wheezing, digital clubbing, cyanosis, coughing up blood, pulmonary heart disease, and collapsed lung (atelectasis or pneumothorax).[17]: Respiratory Tract\nIn rare cases, cystic fibrosis can manifest itself as a coagulation disorder. Vitamin K is normally absorbed from breast milk, formula, and later, solid foods. This absorption is impaired in some CF patients. Young children are especially sensitive to vitamin K malabsorptive disorders because only a very small amount of vitamin K crosses the placenta, leaving the child with very low reserves and limited ability to absorb vitamin K from dietary sources after birth. Because clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X are vitamin K–dependent, low levels of vitamin K can result in coagulation problems. Consequently, when a child presents with unexplained bruising, a coagulation evaluation may be warranted to determine whether an underlying disease is present.[19]",
    "Cause": "CF is caused by having no functional copies (alleles) of the gene cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). As of 2018, over 1,900 mutations leading to CF have been described, but only 5 of them have a frequency greater than 1% among patients. The most common mutant allele, ΔF508 (also termed F508del), is a deletion (Δ signifying deletion) of three nucleotides that results in a loss of the amino-acid residue phenylalanine (F) at the 508th position of the protein.[47][48] This mutant allele is already present in 1 in 20 to 25 people of Northern European ancestry; it accounts for 70% of CF cases worldwide and 90% of cases in the United States; however, over 700 other mutant alleles, some of which represent new mutations, can produce CF.[49] Although most people have two working copies (alleles) of the CFTR gene, only one is needed to prevent cystic fibrosis. CF develops when neither allele can produce a functional CFTR protein. Thus, CF is considered an autosomal recessive disease.[50]\nThe CFTR gene, found at the q31.2 locus of chromosome 7, is 230,000 base pairs long, and encodes a protein that is 1,480 amino acids long. More specifically, the location is between base pair 117,120,016 and 117,308,718 on the long arm of chromosome 7, region 3, band 1, subband 2, represented as 7q31.2. Structurally, the CFTR is a type of gene known as an ABC gene. The product of this gene (the CFTR protein) is a chloride ion channel important in creating sweat, digestive juices, and mucus. This protein possesses two ATP-hydrolyzing domains, which allows the protein to use energy in the form of ATP. It also contains two domains comprising six alpha helices apiece, which allow the protein to cross the cell membrane. A regulatory binding site on the protein allows activation by phosphorylation, mainly by cAMP-dependent protein kinase.[22] The carboxyl terminal of the protein is anchored to the cytoskeleton by a PDZ domain interaction.[51] Most CFTR in lung passages is produced by rare ion-transporting cells that regulate mucus properties.[52]\nIn addition, the evidence is increasing that genetic modifiers besides CFTR modulate the frequency and severity of the disease. One example is mannan-binding lectin, which is involved in innate immunity by facilitating phagocytosis of microorganisms. Polymorphisms in one or both mannan-binding lectin alleles that result in lower circulating levels of the protein are associated with a threefold higher risk of end-stage lung disease, as well as an increased burden of chronic bacterial infections.[21]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis of CF is initially based on clinical findings indicative of respiratory diseases, various digestive problems, meconium ileus, and more. Definitive diagnosis may involve genetic testing based on family history or chloride concentration testing in sweat, which is relatively high (>60mEq/L) in individuals with CF.[citation needed]\nIn many localities all newborns are screened for cystic fibrosis within the first few days of life, typically by blood test for high levels of immunoreactive trypsinogen.[79] Newborns with positive tests or those who are otherwise suspected of having cystic fibrosis based on symptoms or family history, then undergo a sweat test. An electric current is used to drive pilocarpine into the skin, stimulating sweating. The sweat is collected and analyzed for salt levels. Having unusually high levels of chloride in the sweat suggests CFTR is dysfunctional; the person is then diagnosed with cystic fibrosis.[17]: Diagnosis and Assessment [note 1] Genetic testing is also available to identify the CFTR mutations typically associated with cystic fibrosis. Many laboratories can test for the 30–96 most common CFTR mutations, which can identify over 90% of people with cystic fibrosis.[17]: Diagnosis and Assessment\nPeople with CF have less thiocyanate and hypothiocyanite in their saliva[81] and mucus (Banfi et al.). In the case of milder forms of CF, transepithelial potential difference measurements can be helpful. CF can also be diagnosed by the identification of mutations in the CFTR gene.[82]\nIn many cases, a parent makes the diagnosis because the infant tastes salty.[21] Immunoreactive trypsinogen levels can be increased in individuals who have a single mutated copy of the CFTR gene (carriers) or, in rare instances, in individuals with two normal copies of the CFTR gene. Due to these false positives, CF screening in newborns can be controversial.[83][84]\nBy 2010 every US state had instituted newborn screening programs[85] and as of 2016[update] 21 European countries had programs in at least some regions.[86]",
    "Treatment": "N/A",
    "Management": "Treatment for CF is diverse, tailored to different symptoms, and includes various devices, inhalation medications to alleviate respiratory difficulties, oral enzyme supplements to address exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and, in some cases, surgical interventions for conditions such as meconium ileus.[92] While treatment alleviates symptoms and prevents potential complications, there is currently no cure for the disease.[citation needed]\nThe management of CF has improved significantly over the past 70 years. While infants born with it 70 years ago would have been unlikely to live beyond their first year, infants today are likely to live well into adulthood. Advances in the treatment of cystic fibrosis have meant that people with cystic fibrosis can live a fuller life less encumbered by their condition. The cornerstones of management are the proactive treatment of airway infection, encouragement of good nutrition, and an active lifestyle. Pulmonary rehabilitation as a management of CF continues throughout a person's life, and is aimed at maximizing organ function, and therefore the quality of life.[93] Occupational therapists use energy conservation techniques in the rehabilitation process for patients with cystic fibrosis.[94] Examples of energy conservation techniques are ergonomic principles, pursed lip breathing, and diaphragmatic breathing.[95] People with CF tend to have fatigue and dyspnoea due to chronic pulmonary infections, so reducing the amount of energy spent during activities can help people feel better and gain more independence.[94] At best, current treatments delay the decline in organ function.[citation needed] Because of the wide variation in disease symptoms, treatment typically occurs at specialist multidisciplinary centers and is tailored to the individual. Targets for therapy are the lungs, gastrointestinal tract (including pancreatic enzyme supplements), the reproductive organs (including assisted reproductive technology), and psychological support.[96]\nThe most consistent aspect of therapy in CF is limiting and treating the lung damage caused by thick mucus and infection, with the goal of maintaining quality of life. Intravenous, inhaled, and oral antibiotics are used to treat chronic and acute infections. Mechanical devices and inhalation medications are used to alter and clear the thickened mucus. These therapies, while effective, can be extremely time-consuming. Oxygen therapy at home is recommended in those with significantly low oxygen levels.[97] Many people with CF use probiotics, which are thought to be able to correct intestinal dysbiosis and inflammation, but the clinical trial evidence regarding the effectiveness of probiotics for reducing pulmonary exacerbations in people with CF is uncertain.[98]"

    "Disease": "Cystinosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "There are three distinct types of cystinosis each with slightly different symptoms: nephropathic cystinosis, intermediate cystinosis, and non-nephropathic or ocular cystinosis. Infants affected by nephropathic cystinosis initially exhibit poor growth and particular kidney problems (sometimes called renal Fanconi syndrome). The kidney problems lead to the loss of important minerals, salts, fluids, and other nutrients. The loss of nutrients not only impairs growth, but may result in soft, bowed bones (hypophosphatemic rickets), especially in the legs. The nutrient imbalances in the body lead to increased urination, thirst, dehydration, and abnormally acidic blood (acidosis).[citation needed]\nBy about age two, cystine crystals may also be present in the cornea. The buildup of these crystals in the eye causes an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia). Without treatment, children with cystinosis are likely to experience complete kidney failure by about age ten. With treatment this may be delayed into the patients' teens or 20s. Other signs and symptoms that may occur in patients include muscle deterioration, blindness, inability to swallow, impaired sweating, decreased hair and skin pigmentation, diabetes, and thyroid and nervous system problems.[citation needed]\nThe signs and symptoms of intermediate cystinosis are the same as nephropathic cystinosis, but they occur at a later age. Intermediate cystinosis typically begins to affect individuals around age twelve to fifteen. Malfunctioning kidneys and corneal crystals are the main initial features of this disorder. If intermediate cystinosis is left untreated, complete kidney failure will occur, but usually not until the late teens to mid twenties.[citation needed]\nPeople with non-nephropathic or ocular cystinosis do not usually experience growth impairment or kidney malfunction. The only symptom is photophobia due to cystine crystals in the cornea.[citation needed]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "Cystinosis is a rare genetic disorder[11] that causes an accumulation of the amino acid cystine within cells, forming crystals that can build up and damage the cells. These crystals negatively affect many systems in the body, especially the kidneys and eyes.[3]\nThe accumulation is caused by abnormal transport of cystine from lysosomes, resulting in a massive intra-lysosomal cystine accumulation in tissues. Via an as yet unknown mechanism, lysosomal cystine appears to amplify and alter apoptosis in such a way that cells die inappropriately, leading to loss of renal epithelial cells. This results in renal Fanconi syndrome,[12] and similar loss in other tissues can account for the short stature, retinopathy, and other features of the disease.\nDefinitive diagnosis and treatment monitoring are most often performed through measurement of white blood cell cystine level using tandem mass spectrometry.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Cystinosis is normally treated with cysteamine, which is available in capsules and in eye drops.[13] Cysteamine acts to solubilize the cystine by (1) forming a mixed disulfide cysteine-cysteamine and (2) reducing cystine to cysteine. People with cystinosis are also often given sodium citrate to treat the blood acidosis, as well as potassium and phosphorus supplements as well as others. If the kidneys become significantly impaired or fail, then treatment must be begun to ensure continued survival, up to and including renal transplantation.[14]",

    "Signs and symptoms": "Males\nIn males, the symptoms of Danon disease are more severe. Features of Danon disease in males are:[citation needed]\n• An early age of onset of muscle weakness and heart disease (onset in childhood or adolescence)\n• Some learning problems or intellectual disability can be present\n• Muscle weakness can be severe and can affect endurance and the ability to walk\n• Heart disease (cardiomyopathy) can be severe and can lead to a need for medications. It usually progresses to heart failure, commonly complicated by atrial fibrillation and embolic strokes with severe neurological disability,[3] leading to death unless a heart transplant is performed.\n• Cardiac conduction abnormalities can occur. Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome is a common conduction pattern in Danon disease.\n• Symptoms are usually gradually progressive\n• Some individuals may have visual disturbances, and/or retinal pigment abnormalities\n• Danon Disease is rare and unfamiliar to most physicians. It can be mistaken for other forms of heart disease and/or muscular dystrophies, including Pompe disease.\nFemales\nIn females, the symptoms of Danon disease are less severe. Common symptoms of Danon disease in females are:[citation needed]\n• A later age of onset of symptoms. Many females will not have obvious symptoms until late adolescence or even adulthood.\n• Learning problems and intellectual disability are usually absent.\n• Muscle weakness is often absent or subtle.

    "Cause": "Although the genetic cause of Danon disease is known, the mechanism of the disease is not well understood. Danon disease involves a genetic defect (mutation) in a gene called LAMP2, which results in a change to the normal protein structure. While the function of the LAMP2 gene is not well understood, it is known that LAMP2 protein is primarily located in small structures within cells called lysosomes.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "Making a diagnosis for a genetic or rare disease can often be challenging.

    "Treatment": "Two recent reviews of the medical literature have evaluated treatment strategies for DD.  Management and treatment of Darier disease depends on the severity of the presented clinical symptoms. Mild symptoms are often treated with moisturising creams, and more severe symptoms with topical and oral retinol or other medications (oral medications having higher strength than topical equivalents), and medical procedures.[22][23]\nIn many mild cases, DD can be managed by avoiding excessive perspiration and non-breathable and abrasive clothing (producing contact dermatitis), washing with salty water, and gentle abrasion with a gauze pad. This is supplemented by moisturising lotions and topical sunscreens. Most patients with Darier's disease can live normal healthy lives.\nIn more severe cases of DD, application of topical and oral medications, particularly retinoids, is prescribed. Hospitalisation may be required for seriously affected individuals who display frequent relapse and remit patterns and severe infections.\nRapid resolution of rash symptoms can be complicated by the increased vulnerability of affected skin surfaces to secondary bacterial or viral infections. Bacterial overgrowth can produce an odour. The main bacteria is epidermal Staphylococcus aureus. The main viruses are human papillomavirus (HPV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV). Infections are treated with antibiotics (for bacteria) and antiviral medications (for viruses).[citation needed]\nTreatments that have evidence-based support (though not for all persons treated) can be classified into a number of groups.[22] Because DD is a product of systemic Vitamin A deficiency, retinoids, chemical compounds (molecules) that are forms of (or related to) Vitamin A, are often recommended. Vitamin A acid compounds are often preferred as being less toxic than Vitamin A itself.[15]\n1. Topical medications: Retinoids (Adapalene, Tretinoin, Isotretinoin, Tazarotene gel).

    "Disease": "GLUT1 deficiency",
    "Signs and symptoms": "N/A",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "Early diagnosis is crucial in order to initiate treatment during the important early stages of brain development.  To make a proper diagnosis, it is important to know the various symptoms of GLUT1 deficiency and how those symptoms evolve with age.[18]\nGLUT1 deficiency is diagnosed based on the clinical features in combination with determining the glucose concentration in the CSF and/or a genetic analysis through a lumbar puncture (spinal tap).[13] A low glucose value in CSF (<2.2 mmol/L) or lowered CSF/plasma glucose ratio (<0.4)are indicatieve of GLUT1 deficiency. A genetic mutation in the SLC2A1 gene also confirms the diagnosis, although mutations have not been identified in approximately 15% of GLUT1 deficiency patients.[19]  A highly specialized lab test called the red blood cell uptake assay may confirm GLUT1 deficiency but is not commercially available.[20]",
    "Treatment": "N/A",
    "Management": "Anti-seizure medications are generally not effective, since they do not provide nourishment to the starved brain.[8]\nOnce diagnosed, a medically supervised ketogenic diet is usually recommended as it can help to control seizures.[21] The ketogenic diet is the current standard of care treatment, with 80% of patients having >90% seizure reduction[13] and improving some movement disorders in approximately two thirds of GLUT1 deficiency patients.[18] There is also some evidence of some cognitive benefits for GLUT1 deficiency patients on a ketogenic diet, and most parents report improved energy, alertness, balance, coordination, and concentration,[18] especially when the diet is started early in childhood.\nThe ketogenic diet is a diet high in fat and low in protein and carbohydrates, with up to 90% of calories obtained from fat. Since the diet is low in carbohydrates, the body gets little glucose, normally the main energy source. The fat in the diet is converted by the liver in ketone bodies, which causes a build up of ketones in the blood stream, called ketosis. Ketone bodies are transported across the blood-brain barrier by other means than the GLUT1 protein and thus serve as an alternative fuel for the brain when glucose is not available.[22]\nWhile ketogenic diets have been proven effective to control seizures and relieve some movement disorders in many GLUT1 deficiency patients, some patients do not respond as well as others.  In addition, some critical symptoms, including cognitive deficits and certain movement difficulties, tend to persist in GLUT1 deficiency patients treated by a ketogenic diet, raising the question whether GLUT1 deficiency is caused simply by a lack of proper brain energy or if there are more complicated and widespread systems and processes affected.[18]\nThe ketogenic diet must be carefully crafted and tailored to meet the needs of each patient and reduce the risk of side effects.  It should only be used under the care of medical professionals and dietitians, and it may take some time to establish the ideal ratio of fat versus proteins and carbohydrates and other diet variables for each individual patient to experience optimal tolerance and benefits.    Variations on the ketogenic diet, including the Modified Atkins Diet, and diets based on MCT oil have also been shown to be beneficial for some GLUT1 deficiency patients.[18]\nWhile the classic ketogenic diet is commonly used for younger children, compliance with the ketogenic diet can be difficult for older children and adults. In recent years, the Modified Atkins Diet, and MCT oil based diets, have gained increasing acceptance among doctors treating these groups and may be more feasible for quality of life and compliance.[13] There is growing empirical evidence that these diets can provide at least some of the benefits of the classical ketogenic diet for some GLUT1 deficiency patients.[18]\nKetone esters are an area of dietary therapy currently under investigation for potential treatment of GLUT1 deficiency and other medical conditions.  Ketone esters are synthetic ketones that break down into natural ketones when metabolized.  Ketone esters have been shown in recent research to improve seizures and movement disorders in GLUT1 deficient mice, but human studies have not yet been conducted.[18]\nTriheptanoin (C7 oil), a triglyceride oil synthesized from castor beans.[18] is an investigational pharmaceutical-grade medical food that has shown potential as a treatment for a number of inherited metabolic diseases.    When metabolized by the body, C7 oil produces ketones similar to those produced on a ketogenic diet in addition to other types of ketones that are thought to fulfill further metabolic requirements in the absence of sufficient glucose.[18] A phase 3 clinical trial however failed to find an improvement in patients with GLUT1 DS with disabling movement disorders.\nThe inhibition of insulin production to increase glucose in the blood with the medicine diazoxide, in combination with continuous glucose monitoring, has been successful in one adolescent. The increased blood glucose also increases the availability of glucose in the brain, through the increased transfer of more glucose through the GLUT1-protein. She became seizure-free, became more physically active and had improved cognition.[23]\nResearchers are studying gene therapy as a possible effective treatment for Glut 1 Deficiency.[24][25]\nTherapies and rehabilitative services are beneficial since most GLUT1 deficiency patients experience movement disturbances as well as speech and language disorders. Occupational, physical, and speech/language therapies are standard for most patients, especially in childhood.[18] Many families greatly benefit from other therapies such as aquatic therapy, hippotherapy, specific learning strategies, and behavioral therapy.[18]\nGlut 1 patients Weak Areas are lowered IQ and adaptive behavior scores, expressive-language deficits, weakness in fine motor skills, limited visual attention to details, weakness in abstract analytical skills, and weakness in transfer of learning to new contexts.[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "Degos disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The characteristic symptom of Degos disease is the development of papules. Initially, individuals may have skin lesions or rashes, but they will proceed to develop distinct bumps, or papules.[4] Papules are circular in shape, have a porcelain-white center and red border. As papules age, the white centers will sink in and only the border will remain raised. Typically, papules range from 0.5 to 1 cm in width. Papules appear on the trunk and upper extremities and are not found on the individual's palms, soles, scalp, or face.[1]\nSymptoms vary, depending on whether an individual has the benign variant or malignant variant of the disease. Both the benign and malignant forms have development of the characteristic papules. Individuals with the benign form will have the typical papules persisting anywhere from a few years to throughout their whole lives. In the benign form, no inner organs are affected. If an individual develops the malignant form, it means that not only are the papules present, but inner organs are involved. Most malignant cases involve problems of the gastrointestinal tract leading to small intestine lesions, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bowel perforation. If the central nervous system is involved, symptoms can include headaches, dizziness, seizures, paralysis of cranial nerves, weakness, stroke, damage to small areas of the brain due to artery blockage (cerebral infarcts, and cerebral hemorrhage). Additional organs commonly impacted include the heart, lungs, and kidneys. Symptoms that may develop from damage to these organs include double vision (diplopia), clouding of lenses of eyes, swelling of the optic disc (papilledema), partial loss of vision, shortness of breath, chest pain, epilepsy, and thickening of pericardium.[3][4]\nSomeone with the benign form may suddenly develop symptoms of the malignant form.[1] Symptoms can last anywhere from a few weeks to several years. Onset of symptoms typically begins to manifest between the ages of 20–50.[5] A few cases of this condition in newborns have also been described.[6]",
    "Cause": "The papules characteristic for this disease develop due to infarctions, or blockages in small-medium arteries and veins. The underlying cause is unknown for this disease.[1] Though not confirmed, some cases have shown signs of inheritance between first-degree relatives. It has been suggested that the disease has a familial inheritance pattern; it is thought to be an autosomal dominant disorder. In most cases of familial inheritance, the benign variant of the disease has been present.[4][7][8]\nDue to the lack of knowledge of the pathomechanism for this condition prevention strategies are not known. However, in order to prevent worsening of symptoms, consistent evaluations should be conducted by a physician.[1]",
    "Diagnosis": "Clinical evaluation and identification of characteristics papules may allow a dermatologist to diagnose Degos disease.[4] The papules have a white center and are bordered with a red ring. After lesions begin to appear, the diagnosis for Degos disease can be supported by histological findings. Most cases will show a wedge-shaped connective tissue necrosis in the deep corium. This shape is due to the blockage/occlusion of small arteries.[1]\nIndividuals may be diagnosed with the benign form if only the papules are present. However, an individual may be diagnosed with the malignant form if involvement of other organs like the lungs, intestine and/or central nervous system occurs. The malignant, or systematic form of this condition may suddenly develop even after having papules present for several years. In order to quickly diagnose this shift to the malignant variant of the disease, it is important for individuals to have consistent follow-up evaluations. In these evaluations, depending on which organs are suspected to be involved, the following procedures and tests may be conducted: skin inspection, brain magnetic resonance tomography, colonoscopy, chest X-ray, and/or abdominal ultrasound.[1]",
    "Treatment": "Due to the lack of knowledge around the underlying mechanism of malignant atrophic papulosis, an effective treatment method has not been developed.[1] Treatment for this condition is symptomatic.[4] However, several treatment methods have been tested and are still being developed as more information regarding the condition is found. Fibrinolytic and immunosuppressive therapeutic regimens were tested and found to be mostly unsuccessful as treatment methods.[1][8]\nAfter treating conditions comorbid with Degos disease, physicians have recently found improvement in symptoms with the use of eculizumab and treprostinil.[9][10] Discovered by dermatopathologist, Cynthia Magro, response to eculizumab is often immediate and dramatic, but has been of limited duration and is expensive, needing to be infused every 14 days.[9] Treprostinil use has been reported to result in clearing of gastrointestinal and central nervous system findings as well as clearing of cutaneous lesions, but reports are limited. Treprostinil may be more effective than other vasodilators because it may also increase the population of circulating endothelial cells, allowing angiogenesis.[1]",

    "Signs and symptoms": "Clinically, Denys–Drash is characterized by the triad of pseudohermaphroditism, mesangial renal sclerosis, and Wilms' tumor. The condition first manifests as early nephrotic syndrome and progresses to mesangial renal sclerosis, and ultimately kidney failure—usually within the first three years of life.\nMales with Denys-Drash syndrome exhibit gonadal dysgenesis and undescended testes. Females with Denys-Drash syndrome typically have normal genitalia.[1]\nThe presenting characteristics of DDS include loss of playfulness, decreased appetite, weight loss, growth delay, abnormal skeletal development, insomnia, abdominal pain, constipation, and anuria.",
    "Cause": "The cause of DDS is most commonly (96% of patients) an abnormality in the WT1 gene (Wilms tumor suppressor gene). These abnormalities include changes in certain exons (9 and 8) and mutations in some alleles of the WT1 gene. Genetically, the syndrome is due to mutations in the Wilms tumor suppressor gene, WT1, which is on chromosome 11 (11p13). These mutations are usually found in exons 8 or 9, but at least one has been reported in exon 4.[2]\nThe condition can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, but most cases occur due to new genetic mutations in people with no family history of the disorder.[1]",

Researchers have proposed a 'minimal definition' based on symptoms most often part of Dercum's disease: 1) Generalized overweight or obesity. 2) Chronic pain in the adipose tissue.[4] The associated symptoms in Dercum's disease include obesity, fatty deposits, easy bruisability, sleep disturbances, impaired memory, depression, difficulty concentrating, anxiety, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, diabetes, bloating, constipation, fatigue, weakness, and joint and muscle aches.[7] Regarding the associated symptoms in Dercum's disease, only case reports have been published. No study involving medical examinations has been performed in a large group of patients.[4]",
    "Cause": "There are no currently known causes of this disease. There are studies currently proposing several theories of the causes which include inflammation of the adipose tissue, nervous system malfunction and endocrine malfunction. None of the theories that are currently proposed have been found viable. Since little is known about Dercum's disease, there are currently no known modes of prevention.[8]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis of Dercum's disease is done through a physical examination. In order to properly diagnose the patient, the doctor must first exclude all other possible differential diagnoses. The basic criteria for Dercum's disease are patients with chronic pain in the adipose tissue (body fat) and patients who are also obese. Although rare, the diagnosis may not include obesity.[4] Dercum's disease can also be inherited and a family medical history may aid in the diagnosis of this disease.[4] There are no specific laboratory test for this disease. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging can play a role in diagnosis.[9]",
    "Treatment": "Common treatments for Dercum's disease is directed towards treating the individual symptoms. Pain relief medication may be administered to temporarily reduce the discomfort in the patient. Cortisone shots have also been shown to be effective in temporarily reducing the chronic pain. Surgical removal of the damaged adipose tissue can be effective, but often the disease will recur.[10]\nFew convincing large studies on the treatment of Dercum's disease have been conducted. Most of the different treatment strategies that exist are based on case reports. [4] Currently, there is a lack of scientific data on the use of integrative therapies for the treatment or prevention of Dercum's disease. Not enough studies have been done to substantiate that diet and supplements could help with the disease.[citation needed]",

    "Disease": "Dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Symptoms include lack of sweat glands, thin hair, brittle nails, mottled skin, and lack of fingerprints.[6] It is also characterized by a widespread, early-onset reticulate hyperpigmentation.[7] Those affected may also have adermatoglyphia, abnormal epithelial differentiation, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles, acral dorsal blistering, as well as hypohidrosis or hyperhidrosis.[7][8][5]\nDPR is very similar to the related Naegeli-Franceschetti-Jadassohn syndrome (NFJS). Both cause an affected person to lack fingerprints, as well as present a lace-like pattern of hyperpigmentation and hyperkeratosis of the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. DPR is distinguished from NFJS by the duration of hyperpigmentation and lack of dental abnormalities.[9] Since these differences are very slight and relatively minimal, researchers recommend that NFJS and DPR be considered a single disorder.[5]",
    "Cause": "The disease interval for DPR was found to harbor 230 genes associated with the condition.[10] DPR and NFJS syndromes were specifically found to be differentiated from other syndromes by a mutation of the keratin 14 gene,[5] located on chromosome 17q21.2.[11] This was found when keratin genes KRT14, KRT16, and KRT17 were reassessed in 2006, revealing pathogenic mutations of KRT14 in all patients with NFJS/DPR, displaying a strong correlation and suggesting a potential causation.[5] The type of mutations observed were heterozygous nonsense or frameshift mutations,[10] meaning the function of the gene was completely disrupted (missense is correlated with EBS).[5] The different phenotypic presentations of recessive (EBS-causing) versus dominant (NFJS/DPR-causing) premature truncation mutations in KRT14 are still unclear.[5] The NFJS/DPR mutations were verified using two screening approaches, in which it was found that 17delG was absent from a panel of 100 control individuals, and C18X and Q7X were found to create a novel recognition site for the endonucleases DdeI and BfaI.[5] Because the mutations were found to be heterozygous, the condition was concluded to be autosomal dominant in its inheritance pattern.[5]\nInterestingly, a study conducted on five families using a two-point linkage analysis of the combined genotyping data for three families across the NFJS/DPR candidate region generated an LOD score of 6.2 at marker D17S800, with a recombination score of 0.[5] Further analysis revealed that NFJS may be caused by an identical founder mutation located within a 6-Mb interval between D17S946 and D17S2180.[5]\nThe disruption of the KRT14 gene in DPR suggests this gene is important during the early development of dermatoglyphics and sweat glands.[10] Because of the aforementioned genetic similarity between NFJS and DPR, some researchers have suggested treating the disorders as a single condition.[10]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis of DPR begins with review of a patient's medical history, laboratory results, and clinical examination of symptoms. Biopsy and histopathological examination can be used to test for the presence of hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, follicular plugging, and basal cell melanization, all indicators of DPR. Furthermore, abnormalities in skin pigmentation patterns as well as the presence of palmoplantar keratoderma with yellow tinting of the skin can indicate a possible case of DPR.[12] Despite the presence of outward indicators, routine blood testing will not yield abnormal results.\nWhile the aforementioned symptoms of DPR are outwardly identifiable, DPR is a rare genetic disease that requires genetic analysis to yield a confirmed diagnosis.[13]\nThe Genetic Testing Registry lists 15 clinical genetic tests used in obtaining a diagnosis of this disorder. Two of these tests utilize Targeted Variant Analysis, thirteen utilize sequence analysis of the entire coding region, and seven utilize deletion and duplication analysis.[7] The type of test ordered may depend on the clinician's judgement or access to specific testing methods.",
    "Treatment": "N/A",
    "Management": "To date, there is no medical treatment specific to DPR, however symptom management of palmoplantar hyperkeratosis as well as other, secondary symptoms is possible through the use of topical steroids, keratolytics, and emollients.

    "Disease": "Diabetes insipidus",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Excessive urination and extreme thirst and increased fluid intake (especially for cold water and sometimes ice or ice water) are typical for DI.[7] The symptoms of excessive urination and extreme thirst are similar to what is seen in untreated diabetes mellitus, with the distinction that the urine does not contain glucose. Blurred vision is a rarity. Signs of dehydration may also appear in some individuals since the body cannot properly regulate the amount of the water it takes in.[8]\nExtreme urination continues throughout the day and the night. In children, DI can interfere with appetite, eating, weight gain and growth, as well. They may present with fever, vomiting or diarrhea. Adults with untreated DI may remain healthy for decades as long as enough water is consumed to offset the urinary losses. However, there is a continuous risk of dehydration and loss of potassium that may lead to hypokalemia.[9][10]",
    "Cause": "The several forms of diabetes insipidus are:",
    "Diagnosis": "To distinguish DI from other causes of excess urination, blood glucose levels, bicarbonate levels, and calcium levels need to be tested. Measurement of blood electrolytes can reveal a high sodium level (hypernatremia as dehydration develops). Urinalysis demonstrates a dilute urine with a low specific gravity. Urine osmolarity and electrolyte levels are typically low.[32]\nA fluid deprivation test is another way of distinguishing DI from other causes of excessive urination.[33] If there is no change in fluid loss, giving desmopressin can determine if DI is caused by:[34]\n• a defect in ADH production\n• a defect in the kidneys' response to ADH\nThis test measures the changes in body weight, urine output, and urine composition when fluids are withheld to induce dehydration. The body's normal response to dehydration is to conserve water by concentrating the urine. Those with DI continue to urinate large amounts of dilute urine in spite of water deprivation. In primary polydipsia, the urine osmolality should increase and stabilize at above 280 mOsm/kg with fluid restriction, while a stabilization at a lower level indicates diabetes insipidus.[35] Stabilization in this test means, more specifically, when the increase in urine osmolality is less than 30 Osm/kg per hour for at least three hours.[35] Sometimes measuring blood levels of ADH toward the end of this test is also necessary, but is more time-consuming to perform.[35]\nTo distinguish between the main forms, desmopressin stimulation is also used; desmopressin can be taken by injection, a nasal spray, or a tablet. While taking desmopressin, a person should drink fluids or water only when thirsty and not at other times, as this can lead to sudden fluid accumulation in the central nervous system. If desmopressin reduces urine output and increases urine osmolarity, the hypothalamic production of ADH is deficient, and the kidney responds normally to exogenous vasopressin (desmopressin). If the DI is due to kidney pathology, desmopressin does not change either urine output or osmolarity (since the endogenous vasopressin levels are already high).[34][36]\nWhilst diabetes insipidus usually occurs with polydipsia, it can also rarely occur not only in the absence of polydipsia but in the presence of its opposite, adipsia (or hypodipsia). \"Adipsic diabetes insipidus\" is recognised[37] as a marked absence of thirst even in response to hyperosmolality.[38] In some cases of adipsic DI, the person may also fail to respond to desmopressin.[39]\nIf central DI is suspected, testing of other hormones of the pituitary, as well as magnetic resonance imaging, particularly a pituitary MRI, is necessary to discover if a disease process (such as a prolactinoma, or histiocytosis, syphilis, tuberculosis or other tumor or granuloma) is affecting pituitary function. Most people with this form have either experienced past head trauma or have stopped ADH production for an unknown reason.[12]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment involves drinking sufficient fluids to prevent dehydration.[1] Other treatments depend on the type.[1] In central and gestational DI treatment is with desmopressin.[1] Nephrogenic DI may be treated by addressing the underlying cause or the use of a thiazide, aspirin, or ibuprofen.[1]",

    "Disease": "Diffuse infantile fibromatosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The severity of infantile fibromatosis can vary. Although infantile fibromatosis tumors are benign, these tumors can grow in large masses and damage organs as they expand.[6] Some early signs and symptoms can be observed in the early stage of infancy (90% of cases are observed in children under two years of age). Infantile fibromatosis can be categorized by lesions are that are firm and non-tender, and skin that may be purple or red in color and appears ulcerated and crusted.\nAccording to the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD), infantile myofibromatosis can be categorized into different forms. The most common form of infantile myofibromatosis is known as the solitary form. This is mostly found in males around the head, neck or trunk areas. While the lesions are mostly seen on the surface of the skin, they can also extend into the subcutaneous tissue and/or muscle tissue. The second form of infantile myofibromatosis is called the multicentric form without visceral involvement. This form is more commonly found in females, and is characterized by multiple nodules that can occur on the skin, subcutaneous tissue and/or muscle. The most severe form of infantile myofibromatosis, however, is known as the multicentric form with visceral involvement because many organs are typically involved and the growth of the lesion is widespread. This can be categorized as having multiple growths of the skin, muscles, and even internal organs or structures such as the bones, lung, heart, and the GI tract. In this form, life-threatening complications can arise.[3][7]",
    "Cause": "For the majority of cases, infantile myofibromatosis (IM) manifests spontaneously without a known cause. Rarely, multiple family members present with the disorder. In these instances, mutations/variants in the PDGFRB and NOTCH3 genes have been identified as causative.[3]  In familial cases of IM, a mutation in the PDGFRB gene was discovered in 18/19 families .[8] Mutations in the NOTCH3 are less common, to date only one family with IM has been identified to have the mutation.[9]\nThese mutations are caused by errors in DNA replication and they can be either germline or somatic.[10] Germline mutations occur in sperm or egg cells meaning that the mutation can be passed down to future generations. While somatic mutations occur after fertilization during a time of rapid cell division and development. Somatic mutations cannot be passed down to offspring because they do not occur in germ cells (sperm and egg).[10][11]\nEveryone inherits two copies of the same gene, one from either parent. Mutations in one copy or both copies of the gene may result in the development of a disease or disorder. IM may present as either an autosomal dominant or recessive disorder. Autosomal mutations are those not occurring in the X and Y chromosomes. Autosomal dominant disorders are those in which a mutation in one gene is needed for the disorder to manifest, while autosomal recessive disorders need both genes to carry the mutation. IM acts as an autosomal dominant disorder when there is either a germline or somatic mutation in one copy of the PDGFRB gene.[10]  In rare cases, IM manifests as an autosomal recessive disorder in individuals who have inherited two mutated NOTCH3 genes.[9]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis of diffuse infantile myofibromatosis requires microscopic tissue examination as well as a physical examination of the individual.[3] Tumor growth is monitored using imaging software like ultrasound and MRI to visualize the tumor progression, regression, and can be useful in diagnosing recurrence of a tumor. The imaging software allows surgeons to pinpoint the location of the tumors and the extent of the lesions to properly evaluate the size.\nIn order to diagnose infantile myofibromatosis, a tissue sample must be removed from the tumor and be identified as infantile myofibromatosis as opposed to other growths that may look similar in imaging.[3] In a case study in a 15-month-old diagnosed with diffuse infantile fibromatosis, the lesion tissue extracted from the infant's thigh had a salt-and-pepper appearance.[2] By the looks of the tissue, there was swelling due to the increased presence of inflammatory cells, lymphoid follicles (dense tissue), increased capillaries, and some fat cells.[2] Blood draws can be used to genetically test for and diagnose infantile myofibromatosis while also providing more details on potential causes (such as specific genes) and assessing the risk of infantile myofibromatosis in future pregnancies.[3]\nGenetic testing can identify the likelihood of getting the disease.[3] It identifies if the individual is susceptible by screening for the PDGFRB and NOTCH3 gene, which are the causes of infantile fibromatosis.[9] If a child is diagnosed with diffuse infantile fibromatosis, it is recommended for parents and siblings to be tested as well to calculated the risk of conceiving another child with the same gene.[3]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment for diffuse infantile fibromatosis is individualized and depends on the type of treatment that is most appropriate for the type, location, and size of the tumor. There are currently no guidelines for treatment due to how rare this disease is and treatment for individuals with the disease was decided on a case-by-case basis. Sometimes, these infantile lesions are untreated in hopes of a spontaneous remission, which means the lesion heals without any interventions or treatment.[3]\nWhile the tumor may grow slowly (or even shrink over time) and not require any intervention, surgery is the most direct treatment option to remove the tumor to prevent organ damage. As the tumor expands and grows bigger in size, it can lead to life-threatening complications and damage to organs, such as the bones, heart, and lungs.\nIn cases involving vital organs or progression towards vital organs, surgery is highly recommended to avoid further complications and improve the prognosis.[3]\nAnother treatment option is chemotherapy; it is recommended when surgery is not an viable treatment option.[6] However, in the study \"Clinical utility of vinblastine therapeutic drug monitoring for the treatment of infantile myofibroma patients: A case series\", the pharmacokinetic parameters of vinblastine (a chemotherapy medication) were studied among four infants with the age ranging between 3–3.5 weeks at the first dose of vinblastine. The study states that chemotherapy dose adjustment for infants is extremely difficult mainly due to the lack of age-specific pharmacokinetic data sets, and further study needs to be performed in order to establish an evidence-based dosing guidelines for infants.[14]\nSome affected children where surgery could not be performed for any reason or where progression was rapid were successfully treated with a combination of methotrexate and vinblastine.[3]",

    "Disease": "Diffuse panbronchiolitis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Symptoms of DPB include chronic sinusitis (inflamed paranasal sinuses), wheezing, crackles (respiratory sounds made by obstructions such as phlegm and secretions in the lungs), dyspnea (shortness of breath), and a severe cough that yields large amounts of sputum (coughed-up phlegm). There may be pus in the sputum, and affected individuals may have fever. Typical signs of DPB progression include dilation (enlargement) of the bronchiolar passages and hypoxemia (low levels of oxygen in the blood). If DPB is left untreated, bronchiectasis will occur; it is characterized by dilation and thickening of the walls of the bronchioles, inflammatory damage to respiratory and terminal bronchioles, and pooling of mucus in the lungs.[4][5] DPB is associated with progressive respiratory failure, hypercapnia (increased levels of carbon dioxide in the blood), and can eventually lead to pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the pulmonary vein and artery) and cor pulmonale (dilation of the right ventricle of the heart, or \"right heart failure\").[6][7]",
    "Cause": "DPB is idiopathic, which means an exact physiological, environmental, or pathogenic cause of the disease is unknown. However, several factors are suspected to be involved with its pathogenesis (the way in which the disease works).[4]\nThe major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a large genomic region found in most vertebrates that is associated with the immune system. It is located on chromosome 6 in humans. A subset of MHC in humans is human leukocyte antigen (HLA), which controls the antigen-presenting system, as part of adaptive immunity against pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. When human cells are infected by a pathogen, some of them can present parts of the pathogen's proteins on their surfaces; this is called \"antigen presentation\". The infected cells then become targets for types of cytotoxic T-cells, which kill the infected cells so they can be removed from the body.[8]\nGenetic predisposition for DPB susceptibility has been localized to two HLA haplotypes (a nucleotide or gene sequence difference between paired chromosomes, that is more likely to occur among a common ethnicity or trait) common to people of East Asian descent. HLA-B54 is associated with DPB in the Japanese, while HLA-A11 is associated with the disease in Koreans.[9] Several genes within this region of class I HLA are believed to be responsible for DPB, by allowing increased susceptibility to the disease.[7][10] The common genetic background and similarities in the HLA profile of affected Japanese and Korean individuals were considered in the search for a DPB gene.[10] It was suggested that a mutation of a suspected disease-susceptibility gene located somewhere between HLA-B[11] and HLA-A[12] had occurred on an ancestral chromosome carrying both HLA-B54 and HLA-A11. Further, it is possible that a number of genetic recombination events around the disease locus (location on a chromosome) could have resulted in the disease being associated with HLA-B54 in the Japanese and HLA-A11 in Koreans. After further study, it was concluded that a DPB susceptibility gene is located near the HLA-B locus at chromosome 6p21.3. Within this area, the search for a genetic cause of the disease has continued.[9][10]\nBecause many genes belonging to HLA remain unidentified, positional cloning (a method used to identify a specific gene, when only its location on a chromosome is known) has been used to determine that a mucin-like gene is associated with DPB. In addition, diseases caused by identified HLA genes in the DPB-susceptibility region have been investigated. One of these, bare lymphocyte syndrome I (BLS I), exhibits a number of similarities with DPB in those affected, including chronic sinusitis, bronchiolar inflammation and nodules, and the presence of H. influenzae. Also like DPB, BLS I responds favorably to erythromycin therapy by showing a resolution of symptoms. The similarities between these two diseases, the corresponding success with the same mode of treatment, and the fact that the gene responsible for BLS I is located within the DPB-causing area of HLA narrows the establishment of a gene responsible for DPB.[9] Environmental factors such as inhaling toxic fumes and cigarette smoking are not believed to play a role in DPB, and unknown environmental and other non-genetic causes—such as unidentified bacteria or viruses—have not been ruled out.[4][6][7]\nCystic fibrosis (CF), a progressive multi-system lung disease, has been considered in the search for a genetic cause of DPB. This is for a number of reasons. CF, like DPB, causes severe lung inflammation, abundant mucus production, infection, and shows a genetic predominance among Caucasians of one geographic group to the rarity of others; whereas DPB dominates among East Asians, CF mainly affects individuals of European descent. While no gene has been implicated as the cause of DPB, mutation in a specific gene—much more likely to occur in Europeans—causes CF. This mutation in the CF-causing gene is not a factor in DPB, but a unique polymorphism (variation) in this gene is known to occur in many Asians not necessarily affected by either disease. It is being investigated whether this gene in any state of mutation could contribute to DPB.[4][9]",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of DPB requires analysis of the lungs and bronchiolar tissues, which can require a lung biopsy, or the more preferred high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan of the lungs.[7] The diagnostic criteria include severe inflammation in all layers of the respiratory bronchioles and lung tissue lesions that appear as nodules within the terminal and respiratory bronchioles in both lungs.[4] The nodules in DPB appear as opaque lumps when viewed on X-rays of the lung, and can cause airway obstruction, which is evaluated by a pulmonary function test, or PFT.[6]   Lung X-rays can also reveal dilation of the bronchiolar passages, another sign of DPB. HRCT scans often show blockages of some bronchiolar passages with mucus, which is referred to as the \"tree-in-bud\" pattern.[7]  Hypoxemia, another sign of breathing difficulty, is revealed by measuring the oxygen and carbon dioxide content of the blood, using a blood test called arterial blood gas. Other findings observed with DPB include the proliferation of lymphocytes (white blood cells that fight infection), neutrophils, and foamy histiocytes (tissue macrophages) in the lung lining. Bacteria such as H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa are also detectable, with the latter becoming more prominent as the disease progresses.[4][5] The white blood, bacterial and other cellular content of the blood can be measured by taking a complete blood count (CBC). Elevated levels of IgG and IgA (classes of immunoglobulins) may be seen, as well as the presence of rheumatoid factor (an indicator of autoimmunity). Hemagglutination, a clumping of red blood cells in response to the presence of antibodies in the blood, may also occur. Neutrophils, beta-defensins, leukotrienes, and chemokines can also be detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid injected then removed from the bronchiolar airways of individuals with DPB, for evaluation.[4][9]",
    "Treatment": "Macrolide antibiotics, such as erythromycin, are an effective treatment for DPB when taken regularly over an extended period of time.[16][17][18] Clarithromycin or roxithromycin are also commonly used.[19] The successful results of macrolides in DPB and similar lung diseases stems from managing certain symptoms through immunomodulation (adjusting the immune response),[17] which can be achieved by taking the antibiotics in low doses. Treatment consists of daily oral administration of erythromycin[7] for two to three years, an extended period that has been shown to dramatically improve the effects of DPB. This is apparent when an individual undergoing treatment for DPB, among a number of disease-related remission criteria, has a normal neutrophil count detected in BAL fluid, and blood gas (an arterial blood test that measures the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood) readings show that free oxygen in the blood is within the normal range.[16][17][20] Allowing a temporary break from erythromycin therapy in these instances has been suggested, to reduce the formation of macrolide-resistant P. aeruginosa.[16] However, DPB symptoms usually return, and treatment would need to be resumed. Although highly effective, erythromycin may not prove successful in all individuals with the disease, particularly if macrolide-resistant P. aeruginosa is present or previously untreated DPB has progressed to the point where respiratory failure is occurring.[17][20]\nWith erythromycin therapy in DPB, great reduction in bronchiolar inflammation and damage is achieved through suppression of not only neutrophil proliferation, but also lymphocyte activity and obstructive mucus and water secretions in airways.[16] The antibiotic effects of macrolides are not involved in their beneficial effects toward reducing inflammation in DPB.[20] This is evident because the treatment dosage is much too low to fight infection, and in DPB cases with the occurrence of macrolide-resistant P. aeruginosa, erythromycin therapy still reduces inflammation.[16]\nA number of factors are involved in suppression of inflammation by erythromycin and other macrolides. They are especially effective at inhibiting the proliferation of neutrophils, by diminishing the ability of interleukin 8 and leukotriene B4 to attract them.[21] Macrolides also reduce the efficiency of adhesion molecules that allow neutrophils to stick to bronchiolar tissue linings. Mucus production in the airways is a major culprit in the morbidity and mortality of DPB and other respiratory diseases. The significant reduction of inflammation in DPB attributed to erythromycin therapy also helps to inhibit the production of excess mucus.[21]",

    "Cause": "Cause of diphallia is unknown.[13] Its associated anomalies vary largely, ergo it is impossible to give a simple, single explanation of its cause.[12] It is thought to occur due to duplication of cloacal membrane in early embryonic development stages in the fetus, between the third and sixth week of gestation,[13][7] as normal development of cloacal folds in the fetus is typically complete between this time.[10][16]\nNormal development of penis occurs with the fusion of cloacal tubercles at anterior end of urogenital sinus.[1][13] Mesenchyme migrate around cloacal membrane, proliferate and expand around cloacal plate, forming a pair of cloacal folds that fuse to form genital tubercle which develops into penis.[13][1][12] If cloacal membrane is doubled, mesenchyme will migrate and surround both cloacal membranes, leading to the formation of two pairs of cloacal folds around two cloacal membranes, resulting in formation of two genital tubercles and thus two penises.[1][12] The concept of caudal duplication syndrome is used to explain the symptoms of diphallia with associated complex anomalies in lower abdomen and urinary tract.[16][12] Further, as mesenchyme migrate from more than one area, failure in migration and in the fusion of mesoderm results in formation of two genital tubercles [1] and double penises, as well as producing associated anomalies such as double bladders, double urethra, double colons and imperforated anus.[13][12] Failure in proper fusion of urethral folds results in hypospadias.[17] Failure in mesoderm cell migration results in epispadia.[18]\nDiphallia is a rare abnormal external genitalia. The cause is uncertain, but most scientists agree that diphallia is a defect of genital tubercle, and occurs at about week three of gestation, when caudal cell mass of mesoderm is affected by various external environmental factors including drugs, infections and malfunctioning homeobox genes.[11][2]",

In true diplocoria, both pupils constrict and dilate together to light or pharmacologic stimuli, indicating separate sphincters; in pseudopolycoria, only the primary pupil reacts.[1][2] Anterior-segment imaging and careful pharmacologic testing of the pupillary light reflex help differentiate true from false accessory pupils.[10]",
    "Treatment": "N/A",
    "Management": "Treatment depends on symptoms and the underlying cause. Visual symptoms from pseudopolycoria may be reduced with prosthetic or tinted contact lenses that limit stray light or create a single functional aperture.[4] Selected cases of true diplocoria (true polycoria) have been treated surgically (e.g., pupilloplasty) to reconstruct a single round pupil.[11]"

    "Disease": "Donohue syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Facial features indicative of Donohue syndrome include protuberant and low-set ears, flaring nostrils, unusually large mouth, thick lips, and widely spaced eyes. Physical features include stunted growth (including during gestation), lack of subcutaneous adipose tissue, muscle atrophy, hirsutism (excessive body hair growth), and dysplasia (nail malformation).[3] Additionally, a condition known as acanthosis nigricans is present in affected individuals. In acanthosis nigricans, patches of skin darken and thicken to gain a velvet-like appearance. Gender specific features also include enlarged clitoris and breasts, as well as ovarian cysts in affected females, and enlarged penis in affected males.[3] In the Journal of Pediatric Medicine, Donohue and Uchida described affected sisters whose growth appeared to have ended in the seventh month of gestation, both born alive but dying before four months of age.[4] Very early death (or spontaneous abortion) is typical, although affected individuals sometimes live longer than a decade.[4]\nEndocrine related abnormalities as a result of insulin receptor malfunction include insulin resistance, hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia (depending on whether or not the individual has eaten) and hyperinsulemia.[citation needed]\nA much milder form of the disease, in which there is some insulin resistance but normal growth and subcutaneous fat distribution, is also known.[5] It is caused by a less severe mutation of the same gene.",
    "Cause": "Donohue syndrome is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. The mutations responsible for the disorder are found on the short arm chromosome 19 (19p13.2) within the coding sequence of the INSR gene (insulin receptor) causing the production of inactive receptor molecules.[1] There are several mutations that can be responsible for the disease, as any mutation that severely impairs the functionality of the insulin receptor will have similar effects. The INSR gene spans over one hundred and twenty thousand base pairs, which contain twenty-two exons coding for a protein that consists of 1382 amino acids.[6] Some of the introns may or may not be spliced out depending on the kind of cell.[7]\nKnown mutations to the gene which can cause Donohue syndrome include a nonsense mutation that resulted in early termination of the protein, an addition or deletion mutation that resulted in a frame shift,[8] a single missense mutation[4] and in the milder form mentioned above, a single codon change that altered isoleucine to methionine in the receptor protein.[4] Some mutations to the gene instead result in insulin resistant diabetes without Donohue syndrome.[4]\nBecause mutations in the gene are extremely rare, most cases result from consanguineous matings, for example, between cousins.[4] However, the exact mutation need not be the same. Disease can be caused by inheritance of two different mutant alleles, one from each parent, in which case the patient is a compound heterozygote.[9]\nA heterozygous individual (i.e. one who is a carrier for the disease, having only one normal allele for the insulin receptor) will not be affected. Two heterozygous parents have, in theory, a one in four chance of having a child with the disease, and two thirds of their unaffected children will be carriers. However, because spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) often results when the fetus has the disease, in actuality the proportion of children born alive with Donohue syndrome will be lower than 25%.[4]\nIt is possible to do a genetic test to identify carriers, but because it is so rare, this is not usually done unless there is reason to suspect that the individual being tested is a carrier, for instance having an affected sibling or cousin. As expected for a genetic disease that can be caused by many different mutations, it is not limited to a specific ethnic group, and has been seen in people of various ethnicities.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "There are a few ways to diagnose Donohue syndrome. Due to the nature of the disorder, Donohue syndrome can be diagnosed either genetically, symptomatically, or both. Because Donohue syndrome is a genetic disorder, genetic testing can be performed to diagnose the disease. These genetic tests include diagnostic testing, carrier testing, predictive and pre-symptomatic testing, as well as forensic testing. Prenatally, amniocentesis can be performed to determine if the child will have Donohue syndrome.[2] Additionally, the disorder can be diagnosed through laboratory testing to measure blood insulin levels and defective insulin receptors.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "While there currently is no cure for Donohue syndrome, treatments for those with the disease are tailored specifically to the symptoms present in each individual. It is often that a team of medical professionals will come together to treat a patient with this condition in their specific realm of practice such as pediatrics, endocrinology, and dermatology.[3] Treatment will often address specific dysfunctions in the patient, such as skin defects, hormonal imbalances, and normal progression of child growth.[citation needed]",

    "Disease": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy causes progressive muscle weakness due to muscle fiber disarray, death, and replacement with connective tissue or fat.[3] The voluntary muscles are affected first, especially those of the hips, pelvic area, thighs, calves.[3][2][12] It eventually progresses to the shoulders and neck, followed by arms, respiratory muscles, and other areas.[12] Fatigue is common.[13]\nSigns usually appear before age five, and may even be observed when a boy takes his first steps.[14] There is general difficulty with motor skills, which can result in an awkward manner of walking, stepping, or running.[15] They tend to walk on their toes,[15] in part due to shortening of the Achilles tendon,[16] and because it compensates for knee extensor weakness.[12] Falls can be frequent.[17] It becomes increasingly difficult for the boy to walk. The ability to walk usually disintegrates completely before age 13.[15] Most men affected with Duchenne muscular dystrophy become essentially \"paralyzed from the neck down\" by the age of 21.[14] Cardiomyopathy, particularly dilated cardiomyopathy, is common, seen in half of 18-year-olds.[15] The development of congestive heart failure or arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat) is only occasional.[12] In late stages of the disease, respiratory impairment and swallowing impairment can occur, which can result in pneumonia.[18]\nA classic sign of Duchenne muscular dystrophy is trouble getting up from a lying or sitting position,[17] as manifested by a positive Gowers's sign. When a child tries to rise from lying on his stomach, he compensates for pelvic muscle weakness through the use of the upper extremities:[15] first by rising to stand on his arms and knees, and then \"walking\" his hands up his legs to stand upright. Another characteristic sign of Duchenne muscular dystrophy is pseudohypertrophy (enlarging) of the muscles of the tongue, calves, buttocks, and shoulders (around age 4 or 5). Fat and connective tissue eventually replace the muscle tissue, hence the term pseudohypertrophy. Muscle fiber deformities and muscle contractures of Achilles tendon and hamstrings can occur, which impair functionality because the muscle fibers shorten and fibrose in connective tissue.[12] Skeletal deformities can occur, such as lumbar hyperlordosis, scoliosis, anterior pelvic tilt, and chest deformities. Lumbar hyperlordosis is thought to be a compensatory mechanism in response to gluteal and quadriceps muscle weakness, all of which cause altered posture and gait (e.g.: restricted hip extension).[19][20]\nNon-musculoskeletal manifestations of Duchenne muscular dystrophy occur. There is a higher risk of neurobehavioral disorders (e.g., ADHD), learning disorders (dyslexia), and non-progressive weaknesses in specific cognitive skills (in particular short-term verbal memory),[15] which are believed to be the result of inadequate dystrophin in the brain.[21]",
    "Cause": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by a mutation of the dystrophin gene, located on the short arm of the X chromosome (locus Xp21)[22] that codes for dystrophin protein. Mutations can either be inherited or occur spontaneously during germline transmission,[citation needed] causing a large reduction or absence of dystrophin, a protein that provides structural integrity in muscle cells.[23] Dystrophin is responsible for connecting the actin cytoskeleton of each muscle fiber to the underlying basal lamina (extracellular matrix), through a protein complex containing many subunits. The absence of dystrophin permits excess calcium to penetrate the sarcolemma (the muscle cell membrane).[24]\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy is extremely rare in females (about 1 in 50,000,000 female births).[6] It can occur in females with an affected father and a carrier mother, in those who are missing an X chromosome, or in those who have an inactivated X chromosome (the most common of the rare reasons).[25] The daughter of a carrier mother and an affected father will be affected or a carrier with equal probability, as she will always inherit the affected X-chromosome from her father and has a 50% chance of also inheriting the affected X-chromosome from her mother.[26]\nDisruption of the blood–brain barrier has been seen to be a noted feature in the development of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.[27]",
    "Diagnosis": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy can be detected with about 95% accuracy by genetic studies performed during pregnancy.[18]",
    "Treatment": "No cure for Duchenne muscular dystrophy is known.[35]\nTreatment is generally aimed at controlling symptoms to maximize the quality of life which can be measured using specific questionnaires,[36] and include:\n• Corticosteroids such as prednisolone, deflazacort, and Vamorolone (Agamree) lead to short-term improvements in muscle strength and function up to 2 years.[37] Corticosteroids have also been reported to help prolong walking, though the evidence for this is not robust.[38]\n• Disease-specific physical therapy helps maintain muscle strength, flexibility, and function. It aims to:[39]\nMinimize the development of contractures and deformity by developing a program of stretches and exercises where appropriate\nAnticipate and minimize other secondary complications of physical nature by recommending bracing and durable medical equipment[40]\nMonitor respiratory function and advise on techniques to assist with breathing exercises and methods of clearing secretions[39]\n• Minimize the development of contractures and deformity by developing a program of stretches and exercises where appropriate\n• Anticipate and minimize other secondary complications of physical nature by recommending bracing and durable medical equipment[40]\n• Monitor respiratory function and advise on techniques to assist with breathing exercises and methods of clearing secretions[39]\n• Orthopedic appliances (such as braces and wheelchairs) may improve mobility and the ability for self-care. Form-fitting removable leg braces that hold the ankle in place during sleep can defer the onset of contractures.\n• Appropriate respiratory support as the disease progresses is important.\n• Cardiac problems may require a pacemaker.[41]\nThe medication eteplirsen, a Morpholino antisense oligo, has been approved in the United States for the treatment of mutations amenable to dystrophin exon 51 skipping. The US approval has been controversial[42] as eteplirsen failed to establish a clinical benefit;[43] it has been refused approval by the European Medicines Agency.[44][45]\nThe medication ataluren (Translarna) is approved for use in the European Union.[46][47]\nThe antisense oligonucleotide golodirsen (Vyondys 53) was approved for medical use in the United States in 2019, for the treatment of cases that can benefit from skipping exon 53 of the dystrophin transcript.[48][49]\nThe Morpholino antisense oligonucleotide viltolarsen (Viltepso) was approved for medical use in the United States in August 2020, for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in people who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 53 skipping.[50]  Developed by Nippon Shinyaku and the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry (NCNP), viltolarsen's pre-clinical development was supported by pioneering work from Toshifumi Yokota and colleagues.[51] It is the second approved targeted treatment for people with this type of mutation in the United States.[50] Approximately 8% of people with DMD have a mutation that is amenable to exon 53 skipping.[50]\nCasimersen (Amondys 45) was approved for medical use in the United States in February 2021,[52] and it is the first FDA-approved targeted treatment for people who have a confirmed mutation of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene that is amenable to exon 45 skipping.[52]\nComprehensive multidisciplinary care guidelines for Duchenne muscular dystrophy have been developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and were published in 2010.[29] An update was published in 2018.[53][54]\nDelandistrogene moxeparvovec (Elevidys) is a gene therapy that in June 2023 received United States FDA accelerated approval for the treatment of four and five-year-old children.[55][56]\nIn October 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Vamorolone (Agamree) as a Treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Catalyst Pharmaceuticals holds the exclusive North American license and commercial rights.[57]\nIn March 2024, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved givinostat (Duvyzat), an oral medication, to be used in the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy in people aged six years and older. Givinostat is the first nonsteroidal drug to receive FDA approval for the treatment of all genetic variants of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Functioning as a histone deacetylase (Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, givinostat operates by targeting pathogenic processes within the body, ultimately leading to a reduction in inflammation and muscle loss associated with the disease.[58]",

    "Disease": "Dupuytren's contracture",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Typically, Dupuytren's contracture first presents as a thickening or nodule in the palm, which initially can be with or without pain.[13] Later in the disease process, which can be years later,[14] there is increasing loss of range of motion of the affected finger(s). The earliest sign of a contracture is a triangular \"puckering\" of the skin of the palm as it passes over the flexor tendon just before the flexor crease of the finger, at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint.[citation needed]\nDupuytren disease is generally considered painless, but can be painful if nerve tissue is involved, although this is not usually discussed in the literature.[7] The most common finger to be affected is the ring finger; the thumb and index finger are much less often affected.[15] \nThe disease begins in the palm and moves towards the fingers, with the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints affected before the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints.[16] \nThe MCP joints at the base of the finger responds much better to treatment and are usually able to fully extend after treatment. Due to anatomic differences in the ligaments and extensor tendons at the PIP joints, they may have some residual flexion. Proper patient education is necessary to set realistic treatment expectation.\nIn Dupuytren's contracture, the palmar fascia within the hand becomes abnormally thick, which can cause the fingers to curl and can impair finger function. The main function of the palmar fascia is to increase grip strength; thus, over time, Dupuytren's contracture decreases a person's ability to hold objects and use the hand in many different activities. Dupuytren's contracture can also be experienced as embarrassing in social situations and can affect quality of life.[17] People may report pain, aching, and itching with the contractions. Normally, the palmar fascia consists of collagen type I, but in Dupuytren patients, the collagen changes to collagen type III, which is significantly thicker than collagen type I.[18]",

If the hand lies completely flat on the table, the test is considered negative. If the hand cannot be placed completely flat on the table, leaving a space between the table and a part of the hand as big as the diameter of a ballpoint pen, the test is considered positive and surgery or other treatment may be indicated. Additionally, finger joints may become fixed and rigid. There are several types of treatment, with some hands needing repeated treatment.[citation needed]\nThe main categories listed by the International Dupuytren Society in order of stage of disease are radiation therapy, needle aponeurotomy (NA), collagenase injection, and hand surgery. As of 2016[update] the evidence on the efficacy of radiation therapy was considered inadequate in quantity and quality, and difficult to interpret because of uncertainty about the natural history of Dupuytren's disease.[34]\nNeedle aponeurotomy is most effective for Stages I and II, covering 6–90 degrees of deformation of the finger. However, it is also used at other stages.\nCollagenase injection is likewise most effective for Stages I and II. However, it is also used at other stages.[citation needed]\nHand surgery is effective at stage I to stage IV.[35]\nUse of a splint to keep treated fingers straight following various forms of treatment, typically at all times for some days, then at nighttime for some weeks, is usual. However, a 2015 Cochrane review concluded: \"low-quality evidence suggests that postoperative splinting may not improve outcomes and may impair outcomes by reducing active flexion.

    "Disease": "Dysfibrinogenemia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "N/A",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of congenital dysfibrinogenmia is made by clinical laboratory studies that find normal levels of plasma fibrinogen but significant excess in the amount of immunologically detected compared to functionally detected (i.e. able to be clotted) fibrinogen. The ratio of functionally-detected to immunologically detected fibrinogen masses in these cases is <0.7. Partial thromboplastin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, and reptilase time tests are usually prolonged regardless of history of bleeding or thrombosis.[11] Where available, laboratory analyses of the fibrinogen genes and peptide chains solidify the diagnosis. Initial examination of these genes or protein chains should search specifically for \"hot spot\" mutations, i.e. the most common mutations (see Pathophysiology section) that comprise the large bulk of mutations in the disorder.[5] In cases of dysfibrinogenemia in which acquired disease is suspected, diagnosis requires a proper diagnosis of the presence of a causable disease.[4]\nCongenital dysfibrinogenmia is initially distinguished form congenital hypodysfibrinogenemia by the finding of normal immunologically-detected levels of fibrinogen in congenital dysfibrinogenemia and sub-normal levels of immunologically-detected fibrinogen in congenital hypodysfibrinogenemia. Both disorders exhibit mass ratios of functionally-detected to immunologically-detected fibrinogen that are below <0.7. Genetic and protein analyses can definitively differentiate the two disorders.[9]",
    "Treatment": "In a study of 189 individuals diagnosed with congenital dysfibrinogenemia, ~33% were asymptomatic, ~47% experienced episodic bleeding, and ~20% experienced episodic thromboses.[9] Due to the rareness of this disorder, treatment of individuals with these presentations are based primarily on case reports, guidelines set by the United Kingdom, and expert opinions rather than controlled clinical studies.[5]",

    "Disease": "Ecstatic seizures",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The symptoms variably include feelings of increased self-awareness, mental clarity, certainty, feelings of \"unity with everything that exists\" (including the external environment), intense positive affect, a sense of intense serenity or bliss, mystical, spiritual, or religious experiences, physical well-being, a sense of \"hyper-reality\", and time dilation, among others.[2][1][4][5][15][16] The term \"oceanic\" has also been invoked in describing the experiences.[14] The physical well-being includes a feeling of warmth ascending from the feet to the head or a feeling of the body being covered in velvet.[2]\nThe key and essential definitional criteria of ecstatic seizures include:[1]\n• \"Intense positive emotion (bliss)\"\n• \"Enhanced physical well-being\"\n• \"Heightened self-awareness or heightened perception of the external world (clarity)\"\nThe state seems to primarily involve an absence of doubts or uncertainty rather than a primary intense positive emotion.[2] Ecstatic seizures have been compared to the bliss of enjoying music or orgasm and have been described as much better than sex.[1][5] They have also been described as life-changing, for instance resulting in people no longer fearing death or converting from atheism to religion.[2][1] Alternating ecstatic and unpleasant emotions, such as anxiety, have also been reported however.[1][5]\nA description of Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky's ecstatic auras by his close friend Nikolay Strakhov was published as follows:[17][18]\nEpileptic auras, generally speaking, last from a few seconds up to usually 20 to 30 seconds but to a maximum of about 2 to 3 minutes.[2] Thereafter, the seizure may or may not evolve into loss of consciousness and a generalized tonic–clonic seizure.[2][1] In contrast to the auras in ecstatic seizures, most auras of seizures generally are unpleasant, including feelings of anxiety and fear (60%) as well as depression, while positive feelings are only rarely reported.[1]\nThere are some similarities and overlap of ecstatic epilepsy with Geschwind syndrome (occurs in about 7% of cases of temporal lobe epilepsy), orgasmic epilepsy, and certain other forms of epilepsy.[1][19][20][17]\nPeople with ecstatic or pleasant seizures often have a strong wish to prevent the auras from ending and have been known to try to prolong them.[20] In one case, a patient initially refused surgical resection of a brain tumor causing the seizures.[20] Noncompliance with anticonvulsant medication is common.[14] Others have admitted to lowering their medication doses in an attempt to achieve a level that could allow for ecstatic auras without seizures.[20] This is a difficult balance to strike however and has often not been successful.[20] There have been cases of epileptic individuals willingly self-inducing ecstatic or pleasurable seizures via exposure to known provoking epileptogenic stimuli, like flickering or flashing television screens.[1][14][21][22] Positive emotions have been reported to be a trigger of ecstatic seizures in some.[3]",
    "Cause": "The primary brain area thought to be involved in the generation of ecstatic seizures is the dorsal anterior insula.[2][4][1] It is thought that the ecstatic feelings result from ictal hyperactivation of the anterior insular cortex.[5] The epilepsy is often caused by epileptogenic brain tumors.[3]\nBrain imaging studies support activation of the anterior insula in ecstatic seizures.[4][2] Additionally, several instances of reproducible ecstatic-like seizures have been induced during presurgical evaluation with electrical brain stimulation to the dorsal anterior insula.[1][4][2][6][15][16] Intense time dilation has also been produced by stimulation of the right mid-dorsal insular region.[2] Stimulation of a variety of other brain areas, including the inferior temporal gyrus, temporal pole, left amygdala, inferior frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex, and supplementary motor area, have also been reported to produce euphoric or pleasant feelings.[1][2] However, ecstasy-like experiences have not been specifically described with these other areas.[1][2] Stimulation of the right amygdala and the hippocampus have been associated with very unpleasant emotions.[1] It is thought that vast activation of the anterior insula is needed for generation of ecstatic seizures, which may underlie the few cases that have been observed with electrical brain stimulation.[1]\nThe theory of predictive coding posits that the brain is a prediction machine, is constantly modeling its environment and updating this model, and tries to minimize prediction errors (the mismatch between the predictions/model and the actual environment) and uncertainty to avoid surprise and to minimize energy expenditure.[4][2][15] Prediction errors are often experienced as aversive and threatening and can produce feelings of uncertainty and discomfort.[8] It has been theorized that ecstatic seizures, including feelings of certainty, clarity, trust, well-being, serenity, and inner peace, may be due to a temporary blockade of interoceptive prediction error generation and associated negative emotions.[1][4][2][9][7] This in turn results in an acute \"ultimate stable state\", with no ambiguity or \"perfect prediction of the world\", and associated positive feelings.[1][7][2][8] A natural or physiological (but much less intense) analogue could be considered \"aha!\" or \"eureka!\" moments—that is, sudden understanding of a previously incomprehensible problem and associated joy, elation, and satisfaction—for instance discovering the cause of a difficult software bug in computer code.[15] The heightened awareness and time dilation in ecstatic seizures have been hypothesized to be related to the strongly salient nature of the experiences.[1]\nThere is an especially high density of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the dorsal anterior insula.[1][23] This has raised questions about the role of acetylcholine in predictive and emotional processing and in the experience of ecstatic seizures.[1][23]\nEcstatic seizures have been compared to the subjective experiences of psychoactive drugs, such as psychostimulant euphoriants and entactogens, like amphetamines, cocaine, and methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; \"ecstasy\"), as well as psychedelic hallucinogens, like ayahuasca (dimethyltryptamine), psilocybe mushrooms (psilocybin), and peyote (mescaline).[1][10][2][3] The states produced by these drugs can show similarities to the blissful experiences of ecstatic seizures.[1][10][2][3][5] As an example, Alexander Shulgin, who discovered the subjective effects of MDMA, described his first experience with the drug as follows: \"I feel absolutely clean inside, and there is nothing but pure euphoria. I have never felt so great or believed this to be possible. I am overcome by the profundity of the experience.\"[24][25] Activation of the anterior insula may cause the positive affect of these various drugs, similarly to ecstatic seizures.[10][2][3][5] However, the experience of ecstatic seizures has been anecdotally described by some as beyond that which could be achieved with any drug.[1]\nThe causes of ecstatic seizures may also overlap with other non-epileptic and non-pharmacological ecstatic or mystical experiences.[2] The insula has been found to be activated by maternal and romantic love, as well as by pleasant and mesmerizing musical moments and deeper states of meditation.[1][9] Besides the insula, the dopamine reward system of the ventral tegmental area and striatum or nucleus accumbens have also been found to be activated by musical moments.[1] There are many parallels between ecstatic auras and deeper states of meditation.[1][10][3] Greater activation of the dorsal anterior insula has been found in advanced meditators (>10,000 hours of practice) and with greater self-reported intensity of meditation.[1][10][3] More gray matter, a thicker cortex, and greater gyrification of the anterior insula have been found in meditators compared to non-mediators.[1][10] In addition, more years of meditation is positively correlated with gyrification of the anterior insula.[1][10][3] Some people have also been known to have spontaneous and naturally occurring ecstatic and/or mystical experiences similar to those of ecstatic auras, often as single episodes in their lives, that are of non-epileptogenic origin and are outside of a meditative or religious context.[2] These have been referred to as \"awakening experiences\".[2]\nThe state in ecstatic seizures is in notable contrast to various neuropsychiatric disorders, like anxiety disorders, depression, and obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), in which there is intolerance of uncertainty and ambiguous situations, abnormally increased anticipation of aversive stimuli, subjective feelings of doubt (as opposed to certainty), and/or accompanying avoidance behavior.[1][4][9][8][2] Some of these conditions have been associated with increased activity of the dorsal anterior insula.[2] Ecstatic seizures may provide insight into the understanding and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.[4][2] The dorsal anterior insula has been proposed as a potential novel therapeutic target for treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders like severe depression, for instance through non-invasive intermittent brain stimulation techniques.[16] This could be an alternative to the novel field of psychedelics for these conditions, under the assumption that transient mystical experiences could result in long-lasting therapeutic psychological benefits.[16]",

    "Disease": "Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Patients usually present with abdominal symptoms such as altered bowel habits, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and early satiety.[5] In the early stages, these symptoms can be linked to signs of inflammation such as pyrexia and elevated CRP, and/or blood-stained ascites.[6]\nAbdominal pain, fullness, overt bowel obstruction, and the presence of an abdominal mass are linked to the late stages of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis. The intestines become gradually covered with a fibrous cocoon, which causes weight loss, malnutrition, bowel obstruction, ischemia and strangulation, infection, and death.[3]",
    "Cause": "Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis is typically observed in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving long-term peritoneal dialysis therapy. Dialysis fluid's high glucose content and acidic pH cause harm to the peritoneum.[7] High glucose concentrations promote osmosis and diffusion gradients across the peritoneum, while low pH inhibits the production of harmful glucose degradation products (GDPs).[8] GDPs are created when peritoneal dialysis fluid is heated to sterilize it[9] and these result in the production of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) when glucose is present.[10] Less GDP-containing biocompatible solutions are now more frequently used, which lessens peritoneal damage.[11]\nEncapsulating peritoneal sclerosis can also occur in patients who are not on peritoneal dialysis but are suffering from other illnesses like endometriosis, sarcoidosis, peritoneal and intra-abdominal cancers, chronic peritoneal ascites, intraperitoneal chemotherapy, intraperitoneal exposure to particulate matter or disinfectant, abdominal surgery, intraperitoneal infections (tuberculosis), and beta-blocker administration.[12][13]",
    "Diagnosis": "Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis is diagnosed clinically, supported by radiography or laparotomy, and based on a constellation of clinical findings.[5]\nThe non-specific laboratory results associated with encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis are linked to underlying infections, malnourishment, and inflammation.[44][36] It has been demonstrated that dialysate from patients with encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis had higher levels of inflammatory cytokines than did peritoneal dialysis controls, sometimes up to years before the condition's clinical manifestation.[45][46] Nevertheless, no biomarker has been discovered to help anticipate the onset of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis.[47]\nWhen distinguishing encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis from other causes of intestinal obstruction, imaging is frequently useful. Advanced encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis may be suggested by abdominal plain films with peritoneal calcification and dilated bowel loops with air-fluid levels.[5] The small bowel follow-through may be characterized by delayed transit, distension near small bowel adhesions, and a \"cauliflower\" appearance due to peritoneal sclerosis-encapsulated bowel loop compression. Dilated loops of bowel may appear encased in a dense fibrous membrane or matted together and tethered posteriorly on ultrasonography.[48] The appearance of a trilaminar colon wall may be due to intraperitoneal echogenic strands.[49]\nAs of right now, the most extensively researched and widely used imaging method for encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis diagnosis is the CT scan. Small bowel loops are frequently connected by a thickened, encircling peritoneum, which is usually accompanied by proximal bowel dilatation.[49] Increased mesenteric fat density, loculated ascites, and localized or diffuse peritoneal calcification are additional radiographic features.[50][5] Complex loculations may indicate intra-abdominal hemorrhage, but if they contain gas, there is reason to suspect sepsis or a perforation.[51] Elevated thickening or enhancement of the colon wall suggests transmural fibrosis or persistent inflammation.[49] Although it hasn't been used as much for diagnosis, magnetic resonance imaging probably produces similar results. Benefits include better bowel encasement and peritoneal thickening delineation, as well as the avoidance of ionizing radiation.[52]\nThe histologic results for encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis are not specific and can be confused with those for infectious peritonitis or simple peritoneal sclerosis.[53] The mesothelial cell layer is microscopically denuded by fibrin deposition, fibroblast proliferation, and fibrocollagenous deposition. When inflammation is active, there may be an infiltration of inflammatory mononuclear cells.[38] Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis is distinguished from peritoneal sclerosis and peritonitis by the transmembrane glycoprotein podoplanin, which is present on peritoneal mesothelial cells and binds inflammatory cytokines.[54]",
    "Treatment": "Treating the underlying cause of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis is recommended whenever it is feasible. This entails switching from peritoneal dialysis to hemodialysis in the case of peritoneal dialysis.[7]\nThe nutritional status should be evaluated upon encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis diagnosis. Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis cannot be effectively treated with bowel rest or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) alone; however, making sure the patient receives enough nutrition is crucial.[55] Enteral feeding is frequently not tolerated due to obstruction, necessitating TPN.[57]\nMany medications have been used to target the inflammatory component of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis such as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors,[58] cyclosporine,[59] mycophenolate mofetil,[60] colchicine,[61] corticosteroids, and azathioprine.[13][62]\nFor patients who have already experienced significant fibrosis, immunosuppression might not be enough. A potent anti-fibrotic agent, tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that inhibits TGF-β, a crucial cytokine in the fibrosis process.[63]\nBecause encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis surgery is a time-consuming, dangerous, and technical procedure, it should only be performed on patients who have not responded to conservative medical therapy and, if at all possible, in facilities with prior experience performing such procedures.[64][65]",

    "Treatment": "Research has focused on changing the mixture of keratins produced in the skin. There are 54 known keratin genes—of which 28 belong to the type I intermediate filament genes and 26 to type II—which work as heterodimers. Many of these genes share substantial structural and functional similarity, but they are specialized to cell type and/or conditions under which they are normally produced. If the balance of production could be shifted away from the mutated, dysfunctional keratin gene toward an intact keratin gene, symptoms could be reduced. For example, sulforaphane, a compound found in broccoli, was found to reduce blistering in a mouse model to the point where affected pups could not be identified visually, when injected into pregnant mice (5 μmol/day = 0.9 mg) and applied topically to newborns (1 μmol/day = 0.2 mg in jojoba oil).[21]\nAs of 2008, clinical research at the University of Minnesota has explored allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for RD and junctional EB, treating a two-year-old child who is one of two brothers with EB. A second transplant has also been performed on the child's older brother. A Missouri boy has also successfully undergone the transplant, as well as a 5 year old boy from Alabama. So far there have been 12 successful transplants.[22] Another transplant is scheduled for a California baby. A clinical trial is planned for 30 subjects.[23] However, the immune suppression that bone marrow transplantation requires causes a risk of serious infections with large scale blisters and skin erosion.[24] Indeed, at least four people have died in the course of either preparation for or institution of bone marrow transplantation for EB, out of only a small group of patients treated so far.[24] The mechanism of action of this therapy is unclear as hematopoietic stem cells are not thought to contribute to epithelial lineages. Rather, it is speculated that cross-correction from tissue-resident graft-derived immune cells contributes to the observed clinical benefit.[25]\nA pilot study performed in 2015 suggests that systemic granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) may promote increased wound healing in people with dystrophic EB.[26] Transplanting skin derived from genetically modified stem cells onto the wound surfaces has been studied with a report of improvements in one person.[27]\nA 2017 clinical trial with male RDEB (recessive dystrophic EB) patients conducted successful grafting of type VII gene corrected keratinocytes (COL7A1 gene correction using retrovirus transduction), without any serious adverse effects. Type VII collage formation was observed at the dermis-epidermis junction in significant amounts.[28]\nA 2020 study demonstrated the safe allogenic grafting of acellular dermal matrix/scaffolds in EB patients without any observed infection or necrosis and instead noted fewer required dressing changes, promoted wound healing, pain reduction, and an overall improvement in the quality of life of the patients.[29]\nIn 2022, a pharmaceutical gel made out of birch bark extract from Betula pendula and Betula pubescens was approved by the European Union as a treatment for epidermolysis bullosa.[30][31]",

    "Signs and symptoms": "Erdheim-Chester disease can range from having no symptoms to being fatal, depending on how severe the disease is. It can cause symptoms like bone pain, heart problems, neurological issues, exophthalmos, and constitutional changes in health.[4]\nBone pain is the most common symptom, usually affecting the long bones. The pain is typically mild but constant, occurring close to the joints. Most people with ECD have involvement of the long bones similarly on both sides of the body. More than half of cases also involve other organs, such as the heart, eyes, pituitary gland, brain, and kidneys.[5]\nThe cardiovascular system is the second most affected organ, involved in more than half of reported cases. While periarterial infiltration caused by ECD usually has minimal impact, it can cause increased blood pressure if it affects the renal arteries, which is often treated with subsequent stenting. Other complications include pericardial infiltration causing tamponade, right-sided myocardial infiltration, valve issues requiring replacement, and peri-coronary infiltration, which can lead to fatal heart attacks.[6][7]\nOrbital involvement is also common in ECD, with approximately 25% of patients developing bilateral and symmetrical exophthalmos as the disease progresses.[4] The mass effect from retro-orbital lesions can lead to thickening and twisting of the optic nerves. The lesions may also affect the lacrimal glands, orbital muscles, and retro-orbital fat. Additionally, yellowish periorbital cutaneous xanthomas may develop.[2]\nCentral diabetes insipidus is the most prevalent central nervous system manifestation in ECD. This results from hypothalamic or pituitary infiltration and can also lead to other hormonal disruptions, such as hyperprolactinemia or gonadotropin deficiency.[2][8]\nRenal involvement is seen in approximately 11% of ECD cases, often presenting as obstructive uropathy due to retroperitoneal fibrosis or renal histiocytic infiltration. Symptoms can include abdominal pain, trouble urinating, and kidney problems like swelling or reduced kidney function, which may require dialysis.[6]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis can often be challenging due to several factors, including unclear biopsy findings, the rarity of ECD cases, and the need to distinguish it from Langerhans cell histiocytosis. For these reasons, ECD is often diagnosed based on a combination of clinical symptoms, histology, imaging features, and the presence of mutations in the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways.[9]\nBone biopsy is said to offer the greatest likelihood of reaching a diagnosis. It would appear that approximately half these patients harbor point mutations of the BRAF gene at codon 600 substituting the amino acid glutamine for valine.[8]\nA diagnosis from neurological imaging may not be definitive. The presence of symmetrical cerebellar and pontine signal changes on T2-weighted images seem to be typical of ECD, however, multiple sclerosis and metabolic diseases must also be considered in the differential diagnosis.[10] Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery may be used for diagnostic confirmation and also for therapeutic relief of recurrent pericardial fluid drainage.[11]",
    "Treatment": "There are two FDA-approved targeted drugs to treat ECD.\n• Vemurafenib, an oral agent approved in 2019, targets the BRAF protein.

    "Disease": "Erythromelalgia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The most prominent symptoms of erythromelalgia are episodes of erythema, swelling, a painful deep-aching of the soft tissue (usually either radiating or shooting) and tenderness, along with a painful burning sensation primarily in the extremities. These symptoms are often symmetric and affect the lower extremities more frequently than the upper extremities. Symptoms may also affect the ears and face. For secondary erythromelalgia, attacks typically precede and are precipitated by the underlying primary condition. For primary erythromelalgia, attacks can last from an hour to months at a time and occur infrequently to frequently with multiple times daily. Attacks most frequently occur at night, thus having the potential to greatly interfere with sleep. Common triggers for daytime episodes are exertion, heating of the affected extremities, and alcohol or caffeine consumption, and any pressure applied to the limbs. In some patients sugar and even melon consumption have also been known to provoke attacks. Many of those with primary erythromelalgia avoid wearing shoes or socks as the heat this generates is known to produce erythromelalgia attacks.[9] The coexistence of erythromelalgia and Raynaud's phenomenon is rare, but case studies of patients with both diagnoses have been reported in medical journals.[17] Symptoms may present gradually and incrementally, sometimes taking years to become intense enough for patients to seek medical care.  In other cases symptoms emerge full blown with onset.[citation needed]\nEpidemic erythromelalgia is characterized by burning pain in the toes and soles of the feet, accompanied by foot redness, congestion, and edema; a few patients may have fever, palpitations, headache, and joint pain. In the 1987 epidemic in Hubei, 60.6% of patients had a common cold before the onset of erythromelalgia and 91.2% had pharyngitis.[13]",
    "Cause": "In general, erythromelalgia seems to consist of neuropathological and microvascular alterations. How this occurs in secondary erythromelalgia is poorly understood and may be specific to the underlying primary condition. Primary conditions that have been shown to elicit erythromelalgia are listed in diagnosis, below.[9]\nPrimary erythromelalgia is a better understood autosomal dominant disorder. The neuropathological symptoms of primary erythromelalgia arise from hyperexcitability of C-fibers in the dorsal root ganglion. Specifically, nociceptors (neurons responsible for the sensation and conduction of painful stimuli) appear to be the primarily affected neurons in these fibers. This hyperexcitability results in the severe burning pain experienced by patients. While the neuropathological symptoms are a result of hyperexcitability, microvascular alterations in erythromelalgia are due to hypoexcitability. The sympathetic nervous system controls cutaneous vascular tone and altered response of this system to stimuli such as heat likely results in the observed microvascular symptoms. In both cases, these changes in excitability are typically due to mutation of the sodium channel NaV1.7. These differences in excitability alterations between the sympathetic nervous system and nociceptors is due to different expression of sodium channels other than NaV1.7 in them.[9]\nWhat causes epidemic erythromelalgia in southern China remains unknown although several erythromelalgia-associated poxviruses were isolated from throat swabs of several patients at different counties and from two different seasons.[18][19][20]",
    "Diagnosis": "Erythromelalgia is a difficult condition to diagnose as there are no specific tests available. However, reduced capillary density has been observed microscopically during flaring;[39] and reduced capillary perfusion is noted in the patient. Another test that can be done is to have the patient elevate their legs, and note the reversal (from red to pale) in skin color. Tests done at universities include quantitative sensory nerve testing, laser evoked potentials, sweat testing and epidermal sensory nerve fiber density test (which is an objective test for small fiber sensory neuropathy).[40] Due to the aforementioned factors, patients may face delays in diagnosis.[41]\nOnce it has been established that it is not secondary erythromelalgia — see below — a programme of management can be put in place. Some diseases present with symptoms similar to erythromelalgia. Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), for instance, presents with severe burning pain and redness except these symptoms are often unilateral (versus symmetric) and may be proximal instead of purely or primarily distal. Furthermore, attacks triggered by heat and resolved by cooling are less common with CRPS.[citation needed]\nErythromelalgia is sometimes caused by other disorders. A partial list of diseases known to precipitate erythromelalgia is below.[9]",
    "Treatment": "For secondary erythromelalgia, treatment of the underlying primary disorder is the most primary method of treatment. Although aspirin has been thought to reduce symptoms of erythromelalgia, it is rare to find evidence that this is effective. Mechanical cooling of the limbs by elevating them can help or managing the ambient environment frequently is often necessary constantly as flares occur due to sympathetic autonomic dysfunction of the capillaries. The pain that accompanies it is severe and treated separately (the pain is similar to CRPS, phantom limb or thalamic pain syndrome). Patients are strongly advised not to place the affected limbs in cold water to relieve symptoms when flaring occurs. It may seem a good idea, but it precipitates problems further down the line causing damage to the skin and ulceration often intractable due to the damaged skin.  A possible reduction in skin damage may be accomplished by enclosing the flaring limb in a commonly available, thin, heat transparent, water impermeable, plastic food storage bag.  The advice of a physician is advised depending on specific circumstances.[citation needed]\nPrimary erythromelalgia management is symptomatic, i.e. treating painful symptoms only. Specific management tactics include avoidance of attack triggers such as: heat, change in temperature, exercise or over exertion, alcohol and spicy foods. This list is by no means comprehensive as there are many triggers to set off a 'flaring' episode that are inexplicable. Whilst a cool environment is helpful in keeping the symptoms in control, the use of cold water baths is strongly discouraged. In pursuit of added relief sufferers can inadvertently cause tissue damage or death, i.e. necrosis.[citation needed] See comments at the end of the preceding paragraph regarding possible effectiveness of plastic food storage bags to avoid/reduce negative effects of submersion in cold water baths.[citation needed]\nOne clinical study has demonstrated the efficacy of IV lidocaine or oral mexilitine, though differences between the primary and secondary forms were not studied. Another trial has shown promise for misoprostol, while other have shown that gabapentin, venlafaxine and oral magnesium may also be effective,[9] but no further testing was carried out as newer research superseded this combination.[citation needed]\nStrong anecdotal evidence from EM patients shows that a combination of drugs such as duloxetine and pregabalin is an effective way of reducing the stabbing pains and burning sensation symptoms of erythromelalgia in conjunction with the appropriate analgesia.[citation needed] In some cases, antihistamines may give some relief. Most people with erythromelalgia  never go into remission and the symptoms are ever present at some level, whilst others get worse, or the EM is eventually a symptom of another disease such as systemic scleroderma.[citation needed]\nSome suffering with EM are prescribed ketamine topical creams as a way of managing pain on a long-term basis.[42] Feedback from some EM patients has led to reduction in usage as they believe it is only effective for short periods. Living with erythromelalgia can result in a deterioration in quality of life resulting in the inability to function in a work place, lack of mobility, depression, and is socially alienating; much greater education of medical practitioners is needed. As with many rare diseases, many people with EM end up taking years to get a diagnosis and to receive appropriate treatment. Research into the genetic mutations continues but there is a paucity of clinical studies focusing on living with erythromelalgia. There is much urgency within pharmaceutical companies to provide a solution to those who suffer with pain such as that with erythromelalgia.[citation needed]",

It is also useful to find increased levels of protoporphyrin in feces and the demonstration of an excess of free protoporphyrin in erythrocytes.[17]\nScreening for FECH mutation on one allele or aminolevulinic acid synthase 2 gain-of-function mutation in selected family members may be useful, especially in genetic counseling.[citation needed]\nLiver biopsy confirms hepatic disease in EPP by the presence of protoporphyrin deposits in the hepatocytes that can be observed as a brown pigment within the biliary canaliculi and the portal macrophages. Macroscopically, the cirrhotic liver can have a black color due to protoporphyrin deposits. Using polarized light the characteristic Maltese cross shape of birefringent crystalline pigment deposits is found. The examination of liver tissue under a Wood's lamp reveals a red fluorescence due to protoporphyrin. Liver biopsy is not helpful for estimation of prognosis of liver disease.[15]",
    "Treatment": "There is no cure for this disorder; however, symptoms can usually be managed by limiting exposure to daytime sun and some types of artificial lighting.  Most types of artificial lighting emit light in the problematic wavelengths, with fluorescent lighting being the worst offender.  Color temperature can be a good indicator of what light is most detrimental, as the higher the color temperature, the more violet light (380–450 nm) is emitted.  Incandescent and LED lighting in the soft white range (2700–3000 K) produce the least problematic light.  Additionally, selecting lower wattage bulbs can reduce the overall output of light.[citation needed]\nSince the photosensitivity results from light in the visible spectrum, most sunscreens are of little use (with the exception of non-nano zinc oxide which provides uniform protection between 290–400 nm and some protection up to 700 nm[18]).  Sun protective clothing can also be very helpful, although clothing with UPF values are only rated based on their UV protection (up to 400 nm) and not on their protection from the visible spectrum.  Some sun protective clothing manufacturers use zinc oxide in their fabrics, such as Coolibar's ZnO Suntect line, which will offer protection from visible light.[19]\nWindow films which block UV and visible light up to 450 nm can provide relief from symptoms if applied to the patient's automobile and home windows.[citation needed]\nBlue blocking screen protectors can help provide relief from symptoms caused by televisions, phones, tablets and computer screens.[citation needed]\nEPP is considered one of the least severe of the porphyrias. Unless there is liver failure, it is not a life-threatening disease.[citation needed]",

    "Disease": "Ewing sarcoma",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Ewing sarcoma is more common in males (1.6 male:1 female) and usually presents in childhood or early adulthood, with a peak between 10 and 20 years of age. It can occur anywhere in the body but most commonly in the pelvis and proximal long tubular bones, especially around the growth plates. The diaphyses of the femur are the most common sites, followed by the tibia and the humerus. Thirty percent are overtly metastatic at presentation, while 10–15% of people present with a pathologic fracture at the time of diagnosis.[10] People usually experience extreme bone pain. Rarely, the tumor presents as extraskeletal, or outside the bone, such as in the vagina, pleura, or otherwise.[11][12][13]\nSigns and symptoms include intermittent fevers, anemia, leukocytosis, increased sedimentation rate, and other symptoms of inflammatory systemic illness.[14]\nAccording to the Bone Cancer Research Trust (BCRT), the most common symptoms are localized pain, swelling, and sporadic bone pain with variable intensity. The swelling is most likely to be visible if the sarcoma is located on a bone near the surface of the body, but when it occurs in other places deeper in the body, like on the pelvis, it may not be visible.[15]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "The definitive diagnosis is based on histomorphologic findings, immunohistochemistry and molecular pathology.\nEwing sarcoma is a small-blue-round-cell tumor that typically has a clear cytoplasm on H&E staining, due to glycogen.  The presence of the glycogen can be demonstrated with positive PAS staining and negative PAS diastase staining.  The characteristic immunostain is CD99, which diffusely marks the cell membrane. However, as CD99 is not specific for Ewing sarcoma, several auxiliary immunohistochemical markers can be employed to support the histological diagnosis.[23]  Morphologic and immunohistochemical findings are corroborated with an associated chromosomal translocation, of which several occur.  The most common translocation, present in about 90% of Ewing sarcoma cases, is t(11;22)(q24;q12),[24][25] which generates an aberrant transcription factor through fusion of the EWSR1 gene with the FLI1 gene.[26]\nThe pathologic differential diagnosis is the grouping of small-blue-round-cell tumors, which includes lymphoma, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, and desmoplastic small round cell tumor, among others.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Almost all people receive multidrug chemotherapy (most often vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, and etoposide),[32] as well as local disease control with surgery and/or radiation.[33] An aggressive approach is necessary because almost all people with apparently localized disease at the time of diagnosis actually have asymptomatic metastatic disease.[citation needed]\nThe surgical resection may involve limb salvage or amputation. Complete excision at the time of biopsy may be performed if malignancy is confirmed at the time it is examined.[citation needed] Treatment lengths vary depending on location and stage of the disease at diagnosis. Radical chemotherapy may be as short as six treatments at three-week cycles, but most people undergo chemotherapy for 6–12 months and radiation therapy for 5–8 weeks.[citation needed] Radiotherapy has been used for localized disease. The tumor has a unique property of being highly sensitive to radiation, sometimes acknowledged by the phrase \"melting like snow\", but the main drawback is that it recurs dramatically after some time.[citation needed]\nAntisense oligodeoxynucleotides have been proposed as possible treatment by down-regulating the expression of the oncogenic fusion protein associated with the development of Ewing sarcoma resulting from the EWS-ETS gene translocation.[34][35] In addition, the synthetic retinoid derivative fenretinide (4-hydroxy(phenyl)retinamide) has been reported to induce high levels of cell death in Ewing sarcoma cell lines in vitro and to delay growth of xenografts in in vivo mouse models.[36][37]\nIn most pediatric cancers including sarcoma, proton beam radiation (also known as proton therapy) delivers an equally effective dose to the tumor with less damage to the surrounding normal tissue compared to photon radiation.[38]",

    "Disease": "Extramammary Paget's disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Patients with EMPD present with typical symptoms, similar to MPD,[3] such as severe itchiness (also called pruritus), rash, plaque formation, burning sensation, pain and tenderness.[7] These symptoms are often confused for dermatitis or eczema.[8] 10% of patients are asymptomatic resulting in delayed diagnosis.[7] In rare cases bleeding can also be seen.[9]\nSymptoms of extramammary Paget's disease[7]\nSkin -\n• Temporary rash\n• itchiness\n• Redness of the skin\n• well-defined, non-resolving, eczematous plaque\n• hyperpigmented patches\n• scaly\n• lump\n• thickened skin, appearing leathery\nDischarge -\n• blood\n• ulceration\nSensation -\n• burning sensation\n• tenderness\n• pain\nDisease of the vulva\nVulvar Paget's disease affect women and presents as erythematous (red), eczematous lesions.[10] It is itchy and sometimes pain can be associated with the affected area.[10] The lesion is clearly separated from normal skin in most cases, and sometimes scattered areas of white scale can be present, giving a \"strawberries and cream\" appearance.[11]\nInvolvement may be extensive including the perianal region, genitocrural, and inguinal folds. Clinical examination should determine the presence of periurethral and perianal lesions.[12] In these cases an involvement of the skin by a noncutaneous internal neoplasm may occur.[12]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "Due to the rarity of EMPD and lack of clinical knowledge, the disease is not very commonly diagnosed.[8] Patients are often misdiagnosed with eczema or dermatitis[8] and a delay of 2 years is expected from the onset of symptoms before a definitive diagnosis has been reached.[8]\nIt is important to include that the lesion is associated with another cancer. A biopsy will establish the diagnosis. Punch biopsies are not effective in differentially diagnosing for EMPD and as a result, excisional biopsies of the affected area are taken [XX]. A positive test result for EMPD shows increased numbers of large polygonal cells with a pale bluish cytoplasm, large nucleus and nucleolus, infiltrating the epidermal layer.[7] These neoplastic cells can be found singly scattered or can appear in groups called nests.[7]\nPaget cells contain mucin and cytokeratins which can be used in the diagnosis of EMPD [8] MUC5A2 is found in EMPD of the vulvar and male genitalia regions whereas MUC2 is expressed in perianal EMPD. Loss of MUC5A2 can indicate an invasive spread.[15] Immunohistochemistry (IHC) can be used to determine whether EMPD is either primary or secondary.[15] Primary EMPD tests positive for CK7 but negative for CK20, whereas secondary is positive for both.[15] Lack of positivity for hormone receptors and HER2 protein is overexpressed meaning that the cells are dividing rapidly and can be indicate an aggressive and more recurrent disease.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Many chemotherapy treatments have been used, however the results are not desirable as prognosis remains to be poor.[16] Surgery remains to be the preferred treatment of choice. Wide local excision with a 3 cm margin and intra-operative frozen sections are suggested, due to high risk of local extension despite normal appearing tissue. In cases where Paget cells have invaded the dermis and metastasized, complete removal is often unsuccessful. Recurrence is a common result.[15] Lymphadenoectomy is often performed for infiltrative cases.[16] In lieu of surgery, radiotherapy is also an option and is especially preferred for elderly patients or for inoperable cases where the tumour size is too large.[6]  This form of treatment is also considered as possible adjuvant therapy following excision to combat the high recurrence rate.[2] However, there are side effects of radiotherapy, including but not limited to: vulvitis, post-radiation atrophy of mucous membranes, vaginal stenosis and sexual dysfunction.[2]\nLaser therapy and photodynamic therapies were also used in the past, but it was discovered the carbon dioxide laser did not penetrate deep enough and both treatment modalities resulted in high recurrence rates.[2]\nTopical chemotherapy treatments are effective, with imiquimod showing promising results.[2] However, overall survival begins to decline 10 months following treatment with chemotherapy.[4] Patients with metastatic EMPD only survive for a median of 1.5 years, and have a 7% 5-year survival rate.[4]",

    "Disease": "Fabry disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Symptoms are typically first experienced in early childhood and can be very difficult to diagnose; the rarity of Fabry disease to many clinicians sometimes leads to misdiagnoses. Manifestations of the disease usually increase in number and severity as an individual ages.[5]",
    "Cause": "Fabry disease is caused by a mutation in the DNA sequence of the GLA gene. A person who inherits this mutation does not have enough of a functioning enzyme known as alpha-galactosidase A. The lack of alpha-galactosidase leads to Fabry disease. A deficiency of alpha-galactosidase A (a-GAL A, encoded by GLA) due to mutation causes a glycolipid known as globotriaosylceramide (abbreviated as Gb3, GL-3, or ceramide trihexoside) to accumulate within the blood vessels, other tissues, and organs.[11] This accumulation leads to an impairment of their proper functions.[citation needed]\nAt least 443 disease-causing mutations in the GLA gene have been discovered.[12] The DNA mutations that cause the disease are X-linked recessive with incomplete penetrance in heterozygous females. The condition affects hemizygous males (i.e. all non-intersex males), as well as homozygous, and in many cases heterozygous females. While males typically experience severe symptoms, women can range from being asymptomatic to having severe symptoms.  Research suggests many women experience severe symptoms ranging from early cataracts or strokes to hypertrophic left ventricular heart problems and kidney failure.  This variability is thought to be due to X-inactivation patterns during embryonic development of the female.[13]",
    "Diagnosis": "Fabry disease is suspected based on the individual's clinical presentation and can be diagnosed by an enzyme assay (usually done on leukocytes) to measure the level of alpha-galactosidase activity.  An enzyme assay is not reliable for the diagnosis of disease in females due to the random nature of X-inactivation. Molecular genetic analysis of the GLA gene is the most accurate method of diagnosis in females, particularly if the mutations have already been identified in male family members.  Many disease-causing mutations have been noted. Kidney biopsy may also be suggestive of Fabry disease if excessive lipid buildup is noted. Pediatricians, as well as internists, commonly misdiagnose Fabry disease.[16] All immediate and extended family members in the same family have the same family mutation, so if one member of a family has a DNA sequence analysis performed, other members of the family can be diagnosed by performing a targeted sequence analysis instead of testing the entire gene.[17] Targeted sequencing is quicker and less expensive to perform. One study reported that for every first diagnosis in a family, on average five more family members (immediate and extended) are also diagnosed.[17]\nMRI is accurate in accessing left ventricular mass and thickness and hypertrophy. Late gadolinium enhancement shows an increased signal of the mid wall at the inferolateral wall of the base of the left ventricle, usually in the non-hypertrophic ventricle. T1-weighted imaging can show low T1 signal due to sphingolipid storage in the heart even without ventricular hypertrophy in 40% of those affected by the disease. Thus, MRI is a useful way of diagnosing the disease early.[18] T2 signal is increased in inflammation and oedema.[19]",
    "Treatment": "The treatments available for Fabry disease can be divided into therapies that aim to correct the underlying problem of decreased activity of the alpha-galactosidase A enzyme and thereby reduce the risk of organ damage, and therapies to improve symptoms and life expectancy once organ damage has already occurred.[citation needed]",

    "Disease": "Facial onset sensory and motor neuronopathy",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The sensory symptoms in FOSM start in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve with paresthesias and numbness and characteristically spread from the head to lower parts of the body; involving the scalp, neck, shoulders and upper extremities. The lower extremities are sometimes also affected.[6] The trigeminal involvement may be unilateral or bilateral at onset.[6] Lower motor neuron involvement may start at the same time as sensory involvement or soon afterwards and also spreads in a head to lower body sequence.[6] Bulbar symptoms due to involvement of the cranial nerves are very common; which often leads to difficulties with swallowing or respirations. This may necessitate placement of a feeding tube or non-invasive ventilation.[6] Lower motor neuron symptoms commonly seen in FOSMN commonly include weakness, fasciculations, difficulties with speech and trouble swallowing.[6] Whereas lower motor neuron signs is observed in all cases of FOSMN, upper motor neuron associated weakness, which presents as brisk reflexes sometimes with clonus and a positive Babinski Sign, is also seen but is less common.[6] In approximately 50% of cases symptoms are initially asymmetric; affecting one side of the body, with eventual progression to the other side. In cases of asymmetric spread; the initially affected side may have more severe symptoms.[6] Although most features of FOSMN reflect lower motor neuron impairment some findings have suggested upper motor neuron impairment in FOSMN.[6]\nFrontotemporal dementia, including the behavioral variant, is a co-morbid condition associated with FOSMN.[6]",
    "Cause": "The etiology of FOSMN is unknown but it is thought to involve a neurodegenerative or autoimmune process.[6] Some people with FOSMN were positive for various auto-antibodies and others had partial symptom improvement in response to various immunotherapies suggesting a possible autoimmune pathophysiology.[6] Abnormal TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) deposits were found on autopsy in the nerves of some with FOSMN. Abnormal TDP-43 deposits are seen in 98% of cases of ALS and are also commonly found in frontotemporal dementia. The pathological TDP-43 deposits suggest a neurodegenerative cause of FOSMN with pathophysiology closely linked to that of ALS and frontotemporal dementia.[6]",
    "Diagnosis": "As with many neurological diseases, there is no test that is diagnostic of FOSMN. The diagnosis can be notoriously difficult, mainly on account of its rarity. Diagnosis is based on clinical signs and symptoms with exclusion of similar conditions. There are no validated diagnostic criteria.[6] The principal differential diagnosis to consider is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or a related motor neuron disorder: the chief distinction between the two is the presence of sensory abnormalities in FOSMN, and their absence in the motor neuron disorders. Diagnostic tests such as nerve conduction studies, electromyography, cerebrospinal fluid analyses, and blood tests can help narrow the diagnostic possibilities and support a clinical diagnosis.[6] Neurophysiology studies show a generalized sensory and motor neuronopathy which is most severe cranially.[3]",
    "Treatment": "There is currently no cure for FOSMN. Those with severe disease often require a feeding tube as swallowing is impaired.[6] Those with weakness affecting the muscles of respiration may require non-invasive ventilation. There have been case reports of symptom improvement after immunotherapy, suggesting a possible immune mediated etiology.[7]",

    "Cause": "It is associated with multiple genes:\nMutations in the KCNQ1 gene cause familial atrial fibrillation. The KCNE2 and KCNJ2 genes are associated with familial atrial fibrillation. A small percentage of all cases of familial atrial fibrillation are associated with changes in the KCNE2, KCNJ2, and KCNQ1 genes. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that act as channels across the cell membrane. These channels transport positively charged potassium ions into and out of cells. In heart muscle, the ion channels produced from the KCNE2, KCNJ2, and KCNQ1 genes play critical roles in maintaining the heart's normal rhythm. Mutations in these genes have been identified in only a few families worldwide. These mutations increase the activity of the channels, which changes the flow of potassium ions between cells. This disruption in ion transport alters the way the heart beats, increasing the risk of syncope, stroke, and sudden death.[citation needed]\nMost cases of atrial fibrillation are not caused by mutations in a single gene. This condition is often related to structural abnormalities of the heart or underlying heart disease. Additional risk factors for atrial fibrillation include high blood pressure (hypertension), diabetes mellitus, a previous stroke, or an accumulation of fatty deposits and scar-like tissue in the lining of the arteries (atherosclerosis). Although most cases of atrial fibrillation are not known to run in families, studies suggest that they may arise partly from genetic risk factors. Researchers are working to determine which genetic changes may influence the risk of atrial fibrillation.[citation needed]\nFamilial atrial fibrillation appears to be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means the defective gene is located on an autosome, and only one copy of the defective gene - inherited from one parent - is sufficient to cause the disorder.",
    "Diagnosis": "If untreated, this abnormal heart rhythm can lead to dizziness, chest pain, a sensation of fluttering or pounding in the chest (palpitations), shortness of breath, or fainting (syncope). Atrial fibrillation also increases the risk of stroke. Complications of familial atrial fibrillation can occur at any age, although some people with this heart condition never experience any health problems associated with the disorder. Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of sustained abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia), affecting more than 3 million people in the United States. The risk of developing this irregular heart rhythm increases with age. The incidence of the familial form of atrial fibrillation is unknown; however, recent studies suggest that up to 30 percent of all people with atrial fibrillation may have a history of the condition in their family.[3]",

The majority of patients die in their fifties or sixties.[4]\nFDD patients also have extensive brain atrophy, particularly in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and white matter, as well as very thin and virtually demyelinated cranial nerves.\nCerebral amyloid angiopathy in this disorder is severe.[8] CAA is present in all regions of the central nervous system.[9]\nOther symptoms include intention tremor, neurofibrillary tangles, spasticity,[10] apathy, hyperorality, early dyscalculia, and stereotyped behavior.[11]",
    "Cause": "FDD is caused by a 10-nucleotide duplication prior to the stop codon of the BRI2/ITM2B gene. In healthy people, BRI2 is produced as an immature type-II membrane protein (imBRI2), which is cleaved at the C-terminus by a pro-protein convertase to create mature BRI2 (mBRI2) and a 23aa soluble C-terminal fragment (Bri23). However, in FDD patients, a longer C-terminal fragment, the ADan peptide, is formed from the Danish mutant protein (BRI2-ADan), which exhibits amyloidogenic features. ADan causes amyloid angiopathy in the cerebrum, choroid plexus, cerebellum, spinal cord, and retinas. [12]\nMutations in Cystatin C have also been suggested to be a cause of the disorder.[13]",

There may be self-mutilation of the tongue (especially in toddlers during teething), lips, and cheeks, or loss of teeth. Compulsive oral biting may result in ulcers or tumour-like masses (Riga–Fede disease).[8]",
    "Cause": "Familial dysautonomia is the result of mutations in the IKBKAP gene on chromosome 9, which encodes for the IKAP protein (IkB kinase complex-associated protein). Three mutations in IKBKAP have been identified in individuals with FD. The most common FD-causing mutation occurs in intron 20 of the donor gene. Conversion of T→C in intron 20 of the donor gene resulted in shift splicing that generates an IKAP transcript lacking exon 20. Translation of this mRNA results in a truncated protein lacking all of the amino acids encoded by exons 20–37. Another less common mutation is a G→C conversion resulting in a one-amino-acid mutation in 696, where proline substitutes for normal arginine. The decreased amount of functional IKAP protein in cells causes familial dysautonomia.[citation needed]",

FD does not express itself in a consistent manner. The types and severity of symptoms displayed vary among patients and even at different ages on the same patients, so patients should have specialized individual treatment plans. Medications are used to control vomiting, eye dryness, and abnormal blood pressure. Common management strategies include artificial tears, appropriate feeding strategy (maintenance of adequate nutrition, avoidance of aspiration (thickened formula and differently shaped nipples[further explanation needed] for infants)), daily chest physiotherapy (nebulization, bronchodilators, and postural drainage) for chronic pulmonary disease, pharmaceutical management of autonomic features (e.g. intravenous or rectal diazepam, or rectal chloral hydrate), preventing accidental injury, prevention of orthostatic hypotension (hydration, leg exercise, frequent small meals, a high-salt diet, and medication (e.g. with fludrocortisone)), treatment of orthopedic problems, compensating labile blood pressure.[citation needed]\nParents and patients should be informed regarding daily eye care and early signs of corneal problems, as well as punctal cautery.

These signs typically first manifest themselves in the first or second decade of life.[citation needed]",
    "Cause": "See the equivalent section in the main migraine article.\nFHM mutations are believed to lead to migraine susceptibility by lowering the threshold for cortical-spreading-depression generation. The FHM1 and FHM3 mutations occur in ion channels expressed in neurons. These mutations may lead to both the hyper- and hypoexcitable neurons that might underlie cortical-spreading-depression. How the mutations seen in FHM2 patients might lead to FHM symptoms is even less clear, as the gene mutated in FHM2 is expressed primarily in astrocytes. One proposal states that the depolarization of astrocytes caused by haploinsufficiency of the ATP1A2 Na+/K+-ATPase causes increased release of compounds such as adenosine from astrocytes. These compounds then interact with neighboring neurons, altering their excitability and leading to cortical-spreading-depression and migraine.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis of FHM is made according to these criteria:[citation needed]\n• Two attacks of each of:\n• At least one close (first- or second-degree) relative with FHM\n• No other likely cause\nSporadic forms follow the same diagnostic criteria, with the exception of family history.\nIn all cases, family and patient histories are used for diagnosis. Brain-imaging techniques, such as MRI, CAT scan, and SPECT,[46] are used to look for signs of other familial conditions such as CADASIL or mitochondrial disease, and for evidence of cerebellar degeneration. With the discovery of causative genes, genetic sequencing can also be used to verify diagnosis (though not all genetic loci are known).",
    "Treatment": "N/A",
    "Management": "See the equivalent section in the main migraine article.\nPeople with FHM are encouraged to avoid activities that may trigger their attacks. Minor head trauma is a common attack precipitant, so FHM sufferers should avoid contact sports. Acetazolamide or standard drugs are often used to treat attacks, though those leading to vasoconstriction should be avoided due to the risk of stroke.[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "Fatal insomnia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The disease has four stages:[6]\n• Characterized by worsening insomnia, resulting in panic attacks, paranoia, and phobias. This stage lasts for about four months.\n• Hallucinations and panic attacks become noticeable, continuing for about five months.\n• Complete inability to sleep is followed by rapid loss of weight. This lasts for about three months.\n• Dementia, during which the person becomes unresponsive or mute over the course of six months, is the final stage of the disease, after which death follows.\nClinically, Fatal Insomnia manifests with a disordered sleep-wake cycle, dysautonomia, motor disturbances, and neuropsychiatric disorders.\nOther symptoms include profuse sweating, miosis (pinpoint pupils), sudden entrance into menopause or impotence, neck stiffness, and elevation of blood pressure and heart rate. The sporadic form of the disease often presents with double vision. Prolonged constipation is common as well. As the disease progresses, the person becomes stuck in a state of pre-sleep limbo, or hypnagogia, which is the state just before sleep in healthy individuals. During these stages, people commonly and repeatedly move their limbs as if they were  dreaming.[7]\nThe age of onset is variable, ranging from 13 to 60 years, with an average of 50.[8] The disease can be detected prior to onset by genetic testing.[9] Death usually occurs between 6–36 months from onset. The presentation of the disease varies considerably from person to person, even among people within the same family; in the sporadic form, for example, sleep problems are not commonly reported, and early symptoms are ataxia, cognitive impairment, and double vision.[10]",
    "Cause": "Fatal familial insomnia is a rare hereditary prion disease that is associated with a mutation in PRNP. The gene, which provides instructions for making the prion protein PrPC, is located on the short arm of chromosome 20 at position p13.[11] Individuals with FFI or familial Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (fCJD) both carry a mutation at codon 178 of the prion protein gene. FFI is also invariably linked to the presence of the methionine codon at position 129 of the mutant allele, whereas fCJD is linked to the presence of the valine codon at that position. The disease occurs when there is a change of amino acid at position 178 in which asparagine is found instead of the normal aspartic acid. This has to be accompanied with a methionine at position 129.[12]\nFFI is an autosomal dominant disease caused by a missense GAC-to-AAC mutation at codon 178 of the PRNP prion protein gene located on chromosome 20, along with the presence of the methionine polymorphism at position 129 of the mutant allele. Pathologically, FFI is characterized predominantly by thalamic degeneration—especially in the medio-dorsal and anteroventral nuclei.[13] Phenotypic variability is a perplexing feature of FFI.[14]\nPrion diseases are caused by the accumulation of misfolded prion proteins in the brain. Generally, prion disorders are characterized by long incubation periods and short clinical duration, which means the abnormal prions may accumulate for many years without causing symptoms (long incubation period), but once symptoms begin the disorder rapidly worsens.",

Cortical destruction is a common finding with no soft tissue expansion in many cases. Histopathology of the lesion shows large areas of mature fibrous stroma undergoing hyaline cartilage metaplasia resulting in conspicuous lobules or gradual transformation into chondroid foci. Both hyaline cartilage and chondroid in turn undergo calcification and endochondral cancellous bone formation mimicking epiphyseal plate-like cartilage.[citation needed]\nDifferential diagnosis is concerned with fibrocartilaginous dysplasia of bone, desmoplastic fibroma, low-grade fibrosarcoma, chondromyxoid fibroma and low-grade chondrosarcoma.[5][6][7]\nA full account of imaging findings on radiography, bone scan, CT and magnetic resonance has been provided by Sumner et al.[8]",

    "Disease": "Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva",
    "Signs and symptoms": "For unknown reasons, children born with FOP often have malformed big toes, sometimes missing a joint or, in other cases, simply presenting with a notable lump at the minor joint.[17] The first \"flare-up\" that leads to the formation of FOP bone usually occurs before the age of 10.[17] The bone growth generally progresses from the top of the body downward, just as bones grow in fetuses. A child with FOP will typically develop additional bones starting at the neck, then at the shoulders, arms, chest area, and finally at the feet.[22]\nSpecifically, ossification is typically first seen in the dorsal, axial, cranial, and proximal regions of the body. Later, the disease progresses in the ventral, appendicular, caudal, and distal regions.[17] However, it does not necessarily occur in this order due to injury-caused flare-ups. Often, the tumor-like lumps that characterize a flare-up of the disease appear suddenly.\nBone growth occurring during flare-ups may result in the loss of mobility to affected joints, including, if the jaw/mandible is involved, the inability to fully open the mouth, limiting speech and eating. Bone growth can also result in the immobilization of the hip or knee, affecting the individual's ability to walk. Extra bone formation around the rib cage restricts the expansion of lungs and diaphragm causing respiratory complications.[17]\nSince the disorder is incredibly rare, only occurring in 1 out of 2 million people, the condition may be misdiagnosed as cancer or fibrosis. Misdiagnoses can lead physicians to order biopsies, potentially exacerbating the growth of FOP bone.[23] The presence of malformed toes or thumbs in those born with FOP helps distinguish this disorder from other skeletal problems.[24]\nWith proper medical management the median age of survival is 40 years. However, delayed diagnosis, trauma, and infections can decrease life expectancy.[25]",
    "Cause": "FOP is caused by an autosomal dominant allele on chromosome 2q23-24.[10] The allele has variable expressivity, but complete penetrance. Most cases are caused by spontaneous mutation in the gametes; most people with FOP cannot or choose not to have children.  A similar but less catastrophic disease is fibrous dysplasia, which is caused by a post-zygotic mutation.\nA mutation in the gene ACVR1 (also known as activin-like kinase 2 (ALK2)) is responsible for the disease.[10] ACVR1 encodes activin receptor type-1, a BMP type-1 receptor. The mutation causes substitution of codon 206 from arginine to histidine in the ACVR1 protein.[11][12] This substitution causes abnormal activation of ACVR1, leading to the transformation of connective tissue and muscle tissue into a secondary skeleton. This causes endothelial cells to transform to mesenchymal stem cells and then to bone.[13] \nNormally, the ACVR1 gene encodes the activin receptor type-1 transmembrane kinase that bind BMP receptors (Type I BMPR and Type II BMPR) for chondrogenesis signaling. BMPs belong to a superfamily of proteins known as Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) proteins. The binding of ACVR1 protein to BMP receptors start a signaling cascade that is crucial for inducing endochondral bone formation during development, as well as, skeletal and tissue homeostasis.[14]\nFOP is an autosomal dominant disorder. Thus, a child of an affected heterozygous parent and an unaffected parent has a 50% probability of being affected. Two affected individuals can produce unaffected children. Two unaffected individuals can produce an affected offspring as a result of the mutation of the gene. The homozygous dominant form is more severe than the heterozygous form.[15]\nThe protein that causes ossification is normally deactivated by an inhibitory protein after a fetus's bones are formed in the womb, but in patients with FOP, the protein keeps working. Aberrant bone formation in patients with FOP occurs when injured connective tissue or muscle cells at the sites of injury or growth incorrectly express an enzyme for bone repair during apoptosis (self-regulated cell death), resulting in lymphocytes containing excess bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) provided during the immune system response. The bone that results occurs independently of the normal skeleton, forming its own discrete skeletal elements.  These elements, however, can fuse with normal skeletal bone.[16] The diaphragm, tongue, and extra-ocular muscles are spared in this process, as well as cardiac and smooth muscle.[17] Since the incorrect enzyme remains unresolved within the immune response, the body continues providing the incorrect BMP4-containing lymphocytes. BMP4 is a product that contributes to the development of the skeleton in the normal embryo.[18]\nThe ACVR1 gene encodes a bone morphogenic protein (BMP) receptor; this gene is mutated in FOP. It is responsible for growth and development of bone and muscles. The typical mutation, R202H, makes the inhibitor FKBP1A bind less tightly to the activation GS-loop.[19] The result is that ACVR1 is not effectively turned off, and an overgrowth of bone and cartilage and fusion of joints occurs.[20] Atypical mutations involving other residues work similarly. In some cases, the receptor can end up signalling that it's active without being bound to its activating ligand.[21]\nMost cases of FOP are the result of a new gene mutation: these people had no history of this particular disorder in their family. There are some cases where the individual has inherited the mutation from one affected parent.[20]",
    "Diagnosis": "FOP is diagnosed based on a combination of clinical features, imaging studies, and genetic testing. Hallmark clinical features of FOP include congenital malformations of the large toes (hallux valgus) and episodes of painful soft tissue swelling. The characteristic features of FOP on radiographs and CT scan include extraosseous bone formation in soft tissue, forming corticated bone in ribbons, sheets or bridges across joints. During flare-ups, MRI and ultrasound are sensitive for preosseous lessions, including soft tissue edema and enhancement  prior to ossification.[26] PET scans can identify early, metabolically active lesions, and can predict future sites of ossification.[27] Molecular genetic testing for FOP includes sequence analysis of the ACVR1 gene.[28]\nEarly diagnosis of this disorder through radiology is very important to avoid unnecessary invasive investigations like biopsies. The smallest or trivial trauma or intramuscular injections can amplify progression of the disease through inflammation hence the favorability of radiology. Clinicians should be aware of this rare entity, as it is frequently misdiagnosed as cancer or other benign entities such as infection, resulting in biopsies that can often hasten disease progression.[29]",

    "Disease": "Fibromuscular dysplasia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Symptoms expressed by FMD patients are largely dependent on the vascular bed(s) affected by the disease. Patients may also be entirely asymptomatic and have FMD discovered incidentally (e.g., when imaging studies are performed for other reasons). In a study from the United States Registry for Fibromuscular Dysplasia, the median age at first symptom was roughly 47 years.[2]",
    "Cause": "While the cause of FMD remains unclear, current theory suggests that there may be a genetic predisposition as case reports have identified clusters of the disease and prevalence among twins.[7] According to Cleveland Clinic, approximately 10% of cases appear to be inherited and FMD often coexists with other genetic abnormalities that affect the blood vessels.[citation needed] Approximately 10% of patients with FMD have an affected family member.[1] A study conducted from the patient registry at Michigan Cardiovascular Outcomes Research and Reporting Program (MCORRP) at the University of Michigan Health System reported a high prevalence of a family history of stroke (53.5%), aneurysm (23.5%), and sudden death (19.8%).[2] Though FMD is a non-atherosclerotic disease, family histories of hypertension and hyperlipidemia were also common among those diagnosed with FMD. It is believed that there is not a single cause of FMD, but that there are multiple underlying factors. There are theories of effects of hormonal influence, mechanical stress from trauma and stress to the artery walls, and loss of oxygen supply to the blood vessel wall caused by fibrous lesions.[7] It has been suggested that environmental factors, such as smoking and estrogen, may play a role in addition to genetic factors, however concerns for safety associated with exogenous female hormones in FMD remain theoretical. [10]",
    "Diagnosis": "It is the lack of specific symptoms and their potential to appear anywhere that makes FMD a challenge to detect early on. The most accurate diagnosis comes from combining clinical presentation and angiographic imaging. According to the Michigan Cardiovascular Outcomes Research and Reporting Program (MCORRP, 2013) the length of time from a patient's first signs or symptoms to diagnosis is commonly 5 years.[citation needed]\nFMD is currently diagnosed through the use of both invasive and non-invasive tests.[10] Non-invasive testing includes duplex ultrasonography, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and computed tomography angiography (CTA).[4] Invasive testing through angiography is considered the best way to detect FMD, though it is typically not done early in the diagnosis process due to the higher risk of complications. Occasionally, FMD is diagnosed asymptomatically after an unrelated x-ray presents the classic \"string of beads\" appearance of the arteries, or when a practitioner investigates an unexpected bruit found during an exam. As part of the diagnosis process, a practitioner may review medical and family history and perform vascular examination.[citation needed]\nA definitive diagnosis of FMD can only be made with imaging studies. Catheter-based angiography (with contrast) is the most accurate imaging technique; this test involves a catheter inserted into a large artery and advanced until it reaches the examined vessel.[1] The catheter allows practitioners to view and measure the pressure of the artery aiding in the categorization and severity of the FMD diseased artery. According to a study published in the Journal of Vascular Surgery, \"catheter-based angiography is the only imaging modality that can accurately identify the changes of FMD, aneurysm formation, and dissection in the branch vessels.\"[4] Practitioners believe it is important to utilize intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging because stenosis can sometimes only be detected through the methods of pressure gradient or IVUS imaging.[4] In addition, computed tomography angiography and magnetic resonance angiography are commonly used to evaluate arteries in the brain. Doppler ultrasound may be used in both the diagnosis and follow-up of FMD.[1]",
    "Treatment": "There is no known cure for FMD. However, treatment focuses on relieving associated symptoms. Medical management is the most common form of treatment.

    "Disease": "Follicle-stimulating hormone insensitivity",
    "Signs and symptoms": "In females, FSH insensitivity results in diminished development of ovarian follicles and granulosa cells and low to normal estrogen levels, elevated to very elevated gonadotropin levels, and low inhibin B levels, whereas males present with diminished Sertoli cell proliferation and moderately elevated FSH levels, normal to slightly elevated LH levels, normal testosterone levels, and reduced inhibin B levels.[1][2][3]\nDue in part to elevated LH levels, which stimulate androgen production by theca cells in the ovaries, and due in part to FSH insensitivity, resulting in a lack of aromatase in nearby granulosa cells that normally convert androgens into estrogens, it could be expected that females with FSH insensitivity might present with symptoms of hyperandrogenism at puberty. However, this has not been found to be the case. This may be in part because FSH, via stimulation of granulosa cells and the resultant secretion of yet-unidentified paracrine factors (but possibly including inhibin B), has been shown to significantly enhance the LH-mediated stimulation of androgen production by theca cells.[4][5] In addition, theca cells predominantly secrete the relatively weak androgen androstenedione, whereas granulosa cells, signaled to do so by FSH under normal circumstances, convert androstenedione into its more potent relative testosterone (which is subsequently converted into estradiol).[6] Hence, in females, FSH insensitivity may not only result in deficiencies in estrogen production by granulosa cells, but in diminished androgen synthesis by both theca and granulosa cells as well, which could potentially explain why hyperandrogenism does not occur.[citation needed]\nFSH insensitivity presents itself in females as two clusters of symptoms: 1) hypergonadotropic hypogonadism or hypoestrogenism, resulting in a delayed, reduced, or fully absent puberty and associated sexual infantilism (if left untreated), reduced uterine volume, and osteoporosis; and 2) ovarian dysgenesis or failure, resulting in primary or secondary amenorrhea, infertility, and normal sized to slightly enlarged ovaries. Males on the other hand are significantly less affected, presenting merely with partial or complete infertility, reduced testicular volume, and oligozoospermia (reduced spermatogenesis).[1][2]",
    "Cause": "FSH insensitivity is caused by inactivating mutations of the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) and thus an insensitivity of the receptor to FSH. This results in an inability of the granulosa cells in ovarian follicles to respond to FSH in females, in turn resulting in diminished estrogen production by the ovaries and loss of menstrual cycles, and an inability of Sertoli cells in the seminiferous tubules of the testicles to respond to FSH in males, which in turn results in impaired spermatogenesis.[1][2]",

    "Signs and symptoms": "Most frequently, people with FOXG1 syndrome have abnormal hand movements, problems with walking, dyskinesia, difficulties with feeding, hypotonia, strabismus, progressive microcephaly, and anomalies of the corpus callosum. They also frequently exhibit absence of speech, autistic behavior, teeth grinding or clenching, delayed myelination, bilateral tonic-clonic seizures, choreoathetosis, intellectual disability, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), weight loss, constipation, sialorrhea (drooling), frequent crying without apparent cause, frequent laughing, muscle spasticity, vision problems, tardive dyskinesias, poor eye contact, myoclonic jerks, postnatal growth failure, and short stature. Occasionally, patients may also experience abnormal breathing, scoliosis with or without kyphosis, hypoplasia of the optic disk, poor speech, inability to ambulate, developmental regression, and pachygyria. In very rare cases, they might have repeated seizures without recovery.[8][9][10]",
    "Cause": "FOXG1 syndrome is caused by heterozygous mutations in the gene FOXG1. This gene provides instructions for making the protein Forkhead box protein G1 (FOXG1).[6][9] Most people with FOXG1 syndrome have a new mutation (which means that mutation is new and none of the parents have it), although there have been cases of person inheriting the pathogenic variant of FOXG1 from a healthy parent due to somatic mosaicism.[13][14][15][16]",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnostic criteria for FOXG1 syndrome have been established. Major diagnostic criteria include a de novo mutation in the FOXG1 gene, intellectual disability, an uneventful prenatal period, onset of symptoms within the first months of life, secondary microcephaly, poor muscle tone, severely delayed development with absent speech, and EEG abnormalities. Minor criteria include an irritable mood, facial dysmorphism (such as widely spaced eyes, anteverted ears, and a bulging forehead), strabismus (squint), teeth grinding, GERD, constipation, seizures, sleep pattern anomalies, dystonia, stereotypies, and autistic behaviors.[11][12]",

    "Disease": "Frontonasal dysplasia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Midfacial malformations can be subdivided into two different groups. One group with hypertelorism, this includes FND. The other with hypotelorism (a decreased distance between the eyes), this includes holoprosencephaly (failure of development of the forebrain).[5] In addition, a craniofacial cleft can be classified using the Tessier classification. Each of the clefts is numbered from 0 to 14. The 15 different types of clefts are then subdivided into 4 groups, based on their anatomical position in the face:[6] midline clefts, paramedian clefts, orbital clefts and lateral clefts. FND is a midline cleft, classified as Tessier 0/14.\nBesides this, the additional anomalies seen in FND can be subdivided by region. None of these anomalies are specific for the syndrome of FND, but they do occur more often in patients with FND than in the population. The anomalies that may be present are:\n• Nasal: mild anomalies to nostrils that are far apart and a broad nasal root, a notch or cleft of the nose and accessory nasal tags.\n• Ocular: narrowed eye slits, almond shaped eyes, epicanthal folds (extra eyelid tissue), epibulbar dermoids (benign tumors of the eye), upper eyelid colombas (full thickness upper eyelid defects), microphthalmos (one or two small eyes), congenital cataract and degeneration of the eye with retinal detachment.\n• Facial: telecanthus (an increased distance between the corners of the eye), a median cleft of the upper lip and/or palatum, and a V-shaped hairline.\n• Others: polydactyly (an excess of fingers or toes), syndactyly (fused fingers or toes), brachydactyly (short fingers and/or toes), clinodactyly (bending of the fifth fingers towards the fourth fingers), preauricular skin tags, an absent tragus, low set ears, deafness, small frontal sinuses, mental retardation, encephalocele (protrusion of the brain), spina bifida (split spine), meningoencephalocele (protrusion of both meninges), umbilical hernia, cryptorchidism (absence of one or two testes) and possibly cardiac anomalies.[7]\nThe clefts of the face that are present in FND are vertical clefts. These can differ in severity. When they are less severe, they often present with hypertelorism and normal brain development.[8]\nMental retardation is more likely when the hypertelorism is more severe or when extracephalic anomalies occur.[9]",

In the more severe forms (type 1), \"patients have no vascular lesions, but have rapid psychomotor regression, severe and rapidly progressing neurologic signs, elevated sodium and chloride excretion in the sweat, and fatal outcome before the sixth year.\"[7]\nMore severe forms are linked with mental retardation.[5]",
    "Cause": "Fucosidosis is an autosomal recessive disorder that affects many areas of the body. Mutations in the FUCA1 gene cause fucosidosis. The FUCA1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called alpha-L-fucosidase. The enzyme plays a role in the breakdown of complex sugars in the body.[3] The deficiency of the enzyme alpha-L-fucosidase, which is used to metabolize complex compounds in the body (fucose-containing glycolipids and fucose-containing glycoproteins), leads to lysosomal accumulation of a variety of glycoproteins, glycolipids, and oligosaccharides that contain fucose moieties.[2][4] The result is incomplete breakdown of glycolipids and glycoproteins. These partially broken down compounds accumulate in various parts of the body and begin to cause malfunction in cells,[3] and can eventually cause cell death. Brain cells are especially sensitive to this buildup. Other results are progressive neurological deterioration, skin abnormalities, growth retardation, skeletal disease, and coarsening of facial features.[2] Fucosidosis is the consequence of faulty degradation of both sphingolipids and polysaccharides. Major accumulation of the H-antigen (a member of the ABO blood group antigens), a glycolipid, is seen primarily in the liver of fucosidosis patients; some researchers have speculated that blood type may play a role in the course of the disease.[4][8]",
    "Diagnosis": "A special urine test is available to check for any partially broken-down sugars. If they are present, a skin or blood sample will be taken to test for below-normal amounts of alpha-fucosidase.[2]\nFucosidosis is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means that both parents have to have the mutation and pass it on to the child. When both parents have the mutation, there is a 25% chance of each child having fucosidosis.[2]\nThe condition was traditionally separated by type, with type 1 beginning sooner, progressing more quickly, and being more severe, and type 2 being milder and progressing more slowly; a third, even milder form has also been recognized.[5] Fucosidosis is now considered to be a single disorder and \"represents a disease spectrum with a wide variety of expression.\"[9] More severe forms (type 1) appear in the first 3 to 18 months of life, while milder forms typically appear between 12 and 24 months.[6]",

    "Signs and symptoms": "In terms of the signs/symptoms of Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy it is characterized by a decrease in skeletal muscle tone as well as an impairment in brain and eye development. Initial symptoms of FCMD present in early infancy as decreased ability to feed.  Marked differences in facial appearance occur due to decreased muscle tone. Further characteristics include:[2]\n• Seizures\n• Delay in development\n• Cardiac issues\n• Swallowing difficulty\n• Neurological problems\nFukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy also affects the nervous system and various associated parts.  FCMD affects normal development of the brain producing a broadly smooth, bumpy shaped cortex named cobblestone lissencephaly as well as various other malformations, notably micropolygyria. Children also experience delayed myelination in the brain.[8]",
    "Cause": "The cause of Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy is rooted in the FKTN gene, located at human chromosome 9q31, encoding  the protein fukutin.  Mutations in this gene, and therefore the fukutin protein, are the cause of FCMD.[9] The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.[5]\nThis means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome (chromosome 9 is an autosome), and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder.[10]\nTwo mutations have been identified. The first and most common is an SVA retrotransposal insertion in the 3'-untranslated region. The second is a deep-intronic point mutation c.647+2084G>T. This second mutation has only been found to date in the presence of the first mutation.[11]",
    "Diagnosis": "Serum creatine kinase concentration and muscle biopsies can be obtained to help determine if the individual has FMCD.  FKTN molecular genetic testing is used to determine a mutation in the FKTN gene after a serum creatine kinase concentration, muscle biopsies, and/or MRI imaging have presented abnormalities indicative of FCMD, the presence of the symptoms indicates Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy.  The available genetic test include:[2][4]\n• Linkage analysis\n• Deletion analysis\n• Sequence analysis - exons\n• Sequence analysis - entire coding region",
    "Treatment": "Currently this sub-type of muscular dystrophy has no cure and no definitive treatment exists.[14]  Treatment offers preventative tactics to delay muscle breakdown and increase life expectancy.  Stretching and physical therapy can increase mobility.  Treatment also includes correcting skeletal abnormalities through orthopedic surgery and other orthopedic techniques. Antiepileptic medication is administered to help prevent seizures.  ACE inhibitors and beta blockers help treat heart conditions, and respiratory assistance is more than likely needed at some point for the affected individual.[2][14][15]",

The most common symptoms include abnormal fluid build-up, hepatosplenomegaly, enlarged heart, abnormal bone development, kidney disease that progressively worsens, coarse facial features, and a cherry red spot on the back of the eye.[3]\nThose who are diagnosed with late infantile subtype have symptoms that are similar to early infantile, except that they present around six months of age and tend to be less severe.  Additional symptoms in this subtype can include growth problems, hearing or vision problems, and seizures.[3]\nJuvenile/adult subtype symptoms include impaired balance or coordination, dark red spots on the skin or angiokeratomas, vision loss, seizures,  and muscle jerks or myoclonus. The symptoms of this subtype tend to be less severe than the first two subtypes, and typically start in adolescence, with the average age being 16 years of age.[5]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "When the characteristic symptoms of galactosialidosis are suspected, patients can undergo specific testing to confirm their diagnosis.  One common method includes enzyme assays which measure the activity of neuraminidase-1 and beta-galactosidase.[4] Decreased levels in enzymatic activity indicate a deficiency in cathepsin A.  A complete urinalysis can be performed to detect the presence of oligosaccharides,[4] which would pass through the urine as excess amounts accumulate within cells due to lysosomal dysfunction. [citation needed]\nA diagnosis can more specifically be confirmed through molecular genetic analysis, which is used to identify a mutation in the CTSA gene.  Once a mutation is detected, the results are combined with a clinical exam and patient symptoms to fully diagnose galactosialidosis.[3]  The age of the patient at the onset of symptoms is used to determine the specific disease subtype of the patient.[3] Early infantile patients are diagnosed between birth and 3 months of age, late infantile patients are diagnosed between 3–12 months of age, and juvenile/adult patients are normally diagnosed in adolescence when symptoms begin.[9]\nA prenatal diagnosis was made by Kleijer et al. in 1979 by measuring beta-galactosidase and neuraminidase activities in cultured amniotic fluid cells.[10]",

Splenomegaly may decrease the affected individual's capacity for eating by exerting pressure on the stomach. While painless, enlargement of the spleen increases the risk of splenic rupture.\n• Hypersplenism and pancytopenia, the rapid and premature destruction of blood cells, leads to anemia, neutropenia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia (with an increased risk of infection and bleeding).\n• Cirrhosis of the liver is rare.\n• Severe pain associated with joints and bones occurs, frequently presenting in hips and knees.\n• While Gaucher disease is a spectrum disorder, it can be split into Neuronopathic and non-neuronopathic forms.

The rarity of the disease means dose-finding studies have been difficult to conduct, so controversy remains over the optimal dose and dosing frequency.[9] Due to the low incidence, this has become an orphan drug in many countries, meaning a government recognizes and accommodates the financial constraints that limit research into drugs that address a small population.[citation needed]\nThe first drug for Gaucher's was alglucerase (Ceredase), which was a version of glucocerebrosidase that was harvested from human placental tissue and then modified with enzymes.[32] It was approved by the FDA in 1991[33] and has been withdrawn from the market[34][35] due to the approval of similar drugs made with recombinant DNA technology instead of being harvested from tissue; drugs made recombinantly are preferable since there is no concern about diseases being transmitted from the tissue used in harvesting, there are fewer risks of variations in enzyme structure from batch to batch, and they are less expensive to manufacture.[32]\nAvailable recombinant glucocerebrosidases are:[18]\n• Imiglucerase (approved in 1995)[32]\n• Velaglucerase (approved in 2010)[36]\n• Taliglucerase alfa (Elelyso) (approved in 2012)[37]\nMiglustat is a small molecule, oral medication that was first approved for Gaucher's disease in Europe in 2002.[38] It works by preventing the formation of glucocerebroside, the substance that builds up and causes harm in Gaucher's.

Conception takes place, but placental tissue grows very fast, rather than supporting the growth of a fetus.[13][14][15]\nComplete hydatidiform moles have no fetal tissue and no maternal DNA, as a result of a maternal ovum with no functional DNA. Most commonly, a single spermatozoon duplicates and fertilises an empty ovum. Less commonly, two separate spermatozoa fertilise an empty ovum (dispermic fertilisation).\nPartial hydatidiform moles have a fetus or fetal cells. They are triploid in origin, containing one set of maternal haploid genes and two sets of paternal haploid genes. They almost always occur following dispermic fertilisation of a normal ovum. Malignant forms of GTD are very rare. About 50% of malignant forms of GTD develop from a hydatidiform mole.[citation needed]",

But GTD also leads to elevated serum hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin hormone). Since pregnancy is by far the most common cause of elevated serum hCG, clinicians generally first suspect a pregnancy with a complication. However, in GTD, the beta subunit of hCG (beta hCG) is also always elevated. Therefore, if GTD is clinically suspected, serum beta hCG is also measured.[17]\nThe initial clinical diagnosis of GTD should be confirmed histologically, which can be done after the evacuation of pregnancy (see Treatment below) in women with hydatidiform mole.[18] However, malignant GTD is highly vascular. If malignant GTD is suspected clinically, biopsy is contraindicated, because biopsy may cause life-threatening haemorrhage.\nWomen with persistent abnormal vaginal bleeding after any pregnancy, and women developing acute respiratory or neurological symptoms after any pregnancy, should also undergo hCG testing, because these may be signs of a hitherto undiagnosed GTD.\nThere might be some signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism as well as an increase in the levels of thyroid hormones in some patients. The proposed mechanism is attaching hCG to TSH receptors and acting like TSH weakly.[19]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment is always necessary.[21]\nThe treatment for hydatidiform mole consists of the evacuation of pregnancy.[22][23][24][25][26] Evacuation will lead to the relief of symptoms, and also prevent later complications. Suction curettage is the preferred method of evacuation. Hysterectomy is an alternative if no further pregnancies are wished for by the female patient. Hydatidiform mole also has successfully been treated with systemic (intravenous) methotrexate.[27]\nThe treatment for invasive mole or choriocarcinoma generally is the same. Both are usually treated with chemotherapy. Methotrexate and dactinomycin are among the chemotherapy drugs used in GTD.[28][29][30][31] In women with low risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia, a review has found that Actinomycin D is probably more effective as a treatment and more likely to achieve a cure in the first instance than methotrexate.[32] Only a few women with GTD have poor prognosis metastatic gestational trophoblastic disease. Their treatment usually includes chemotherapy. Radiotherapy can also be given to places where the cancer has spread, e.g. the brain.[33]\nWomen who undergo chemotherapy are advised not to conceive for one year after completion of treatment. These women also are likely to have an earlier menopause. It has been estimated by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists that the age at menopause for women who receive single agent chemotherapy is advanced by one year, and by three years for women who receive multi agent chemotherapy.[citation needed]",

However, unlike GSD-I, gluconeogenesis is functional, so simple sugars (sucrose, fructose, and lactose) are not prohibited.[19]\nA ketogenic diet has demonstrated beneficial for McArdle disease (GSD-V) as ketones readily convert to acetyl CoA for oxidative phosphorylation, whereas free fatty acids take a few minutes to convert into acetyl CoA.[97][98]\nFor phosphoglucomutase deficiency (formerly GSD-XIV), D-galactose supplements and exercise training has shown favourable improvement of signs and symptoms.[33] In terms of exercise training, some patients with phosphoglucomutase deficiency also experience \"second wind.\"[33][35]\nFor McArdle disease (GSD-V), regular aerobic exercise utilizing \"second wind\" to enable the muscles to become aerobically conditioned, as well as anaerobic exercise (strength training) that follows the activity adaptations so as not to cause muscle injury, helps to improve exercise intolerance symptoms and maintain overall health.[48][63][99][100] Studies have shown that regular low-moderate aerobic exercise increases peak power output, increases peak oxygen uptake (V̇O2peak), lowers heart rate, and lowers serum CK in individuals with McArdle disease.[99][100]\nRegardless of whether the patient experiences symptoms of muscle pain, muscle fatigue, or cramping, the phenomenon of second wind having been achieved is demonstrable by the sign of an increased heart rate dropping while maintaining the same speed on the treadmill.[100] Inactive patients experienced second wind, demonstrated through relief of typical symptoms and the sign of an increased heart rate dropping, while performing low-moderate aerobic exercise (walking or brisk walking).[100]\nConversely, patients that were regularly active did not experience the typical symptoms during low-moderate aerobic exercise (walking or brisk walking), but still demonstrated second wind by the sign of an increased heart rate dropping.[100][101] For the regularly active patients, it took more strenuous exercise (very brisk walking/jogging or bicycling) for them to experience both the typical symptoms and relief thereof, along with the sign of an increased heart rate dropping, demonstrating second wind.[100][101][102]\nIn young children (<10 years old) with McArdle disease (GSD-V), it may be more difficult to detect the second wind phenomenon. They may show a normal heart rate, with normal or above normal peak cardio-respiratory capacity (V̇O2max).[48][103] That said, patients with McArdle disease typically experience symptoms of exercise intolerance before the age of 10 years,[48] with the median symptomatic age of 3 years.[62][104]\nTarui disease (GSD-VII) patients do not experience the \"second wind\" phenomenon; instead are said to be \"out-of-wind.\"[48][63][105] However, they can achieve sub-maximal benefit from lipid metabolism of free fatty acids during aerobic activity following a warm-up.[48]",

This means the defective gene is located on an autosome, and two faulty copies of the gene—one from each parent—are required to be born with the disorder. As with all cases of autosomal recessive inheritance, children have a one in four chance of inheriting the disorder when both parents carry the defective gene, and although both parents carry one copy of the defective gene, they are usually unaffected by the disorder.[citation needed]\nThe disease is caused by a mutation in a gene (acid alpha-glucosidase: also known as acid maltase) on the long arm of chromosome 17 at 17q25.2-q25.3 (base pair 75,689,876 to 75,708,272). The number of mutations described is currently (in 2010) 289 with 67 being non-pathogenic mutations and 197 pathogenic mutations. The remainder are still being evaluated for their association with disease.[citation needed]\nThe gene spans approximately 20 kb and contains 20 exons with the first exon being noncoding. The coding sequence of the putative catalytic site domain is interrupted in the middle by an intron of 101 bp. The promoter has features characteristic of a housekeeping gene. The GC content is high (80%) and distinct TATA and CCAAT motifs are lacking.\nMost cases appear to be due to three mutations. A transversion (T → G) mutation is the most common among adults with this disorder. This mutation interrupts a site of RNA splicing.\nThe gene encodes a protein—acid alpha-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.20)—which is a lysosomal hydrolase. The protein is an enzyme that normally degrades the alpha -1,4 and alpha -1,6 linkages in glycogen, maltose and isomaltose and is required for the degradation of 1–3% of cellular glycogen. The deficiency of this enzyme results in the accumulation of structurally normal glycogen in lysosomes and cytoplasm in affected individuals. Excessive glycogen storage within lysosomes may interrupt the normal functioning of other organelles and lead to cellular injury.\nA putative homologue—acid alpha-glucosidase-related gene 1—has been identified in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.",
    "Diagnosis": "In the early-onset form, an infant will present with poor feeding causing failure to thrive, or with difficulty breathing. The usual initial investigations include chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, and echocardiography. Typical findings are those of an enlarged heart with non-specific conduction defects. Biochemical investigations include serum creatine kinase (typically increased 10 fold) with lesser elevations of the serum aldolase, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase and lactic dehydrogenase. Diagnosis is made by estimating the acid alpha-glucosidase activity in either skin biopsy (fibroblasts), muscle biopsy (muscle cells), or white blood cells. The choice of sample depends on the facilities available at the diagnostic laboratory.[citation needed]\nIn the late-onset form, an adult will present with gradually progressive arm and leg weakness, with worsening respiratory function. Electromyography may be used initially to distinguish Pompe from other causes of limb weakness. The findings on biochemical tests are similar to those of the infantile form, with the caveat that the creatine kinase may be normal in some cases. The diagnosis is by estimation of the enzyme activity in a suitable sample.[citation needed]\nOn May 17, 2013, the Secretary's Discretionary Advisory Committee on Heritable Diseases in Newborns and Children (DACHDNC) approved a recommendation to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to add Pompe to the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP).[5] The HHS secretary must first approve the recommendation before the disease is formally added to the panel.",

This was based on enzyme replacement therapy using biologically active recombinant human alglucosidase alfa produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. Myozyme falls under the FDA orphan drug designation and was approved under a priority review.[citation needed]\nThe FDA approved Myozyme for administration by intravenous infusion of the solution.[9] The safety and efficacy of Myozyme were assessed in two separate clinical trials in 39 infantile-onset patients with Pompe disease ranging in age from 1 month to 3.5 years at the time of the first infusion.[9] Myozyme treatment prolongs ventilator-free survival and overall survival. Early diagnosis and early treatment lead to much better outcomes. The treatment is not without side effects which include fever, flushing, skin rash, increased heart rate, and even shock; these conditions, however, are usually manageable.[citation needed]\nMyozyme costs an average of US$300,000 a year and must be taken for the patient's entire life, so some American health insurers have refused to pay for it.[10] In August 2006, Health Canada approved Myozyme for the treatment of Pompe disease. In June 2007, the Canadian Common Drug Review issued its recommendations regarding public funding for Myozyme therapy. Their recommendation was to provide funding to treat a tiny subset of Pompe patients (Infants less one year of age with cardiomyopathy).[11]\nIn May 2010, the FDA approved Lumizyme for the treatment of late-onset Pompe disease.[12] Lumizyme and Myozyme have the same generic ingredient (alglucosidase alfa) and manufacturer (Genzyme Corporation).[9] The difference between these two products is in the manufacturing process.[9] Myozyme is made using a 160-L bioreactor, while Lumizyme uses a 4000-L bioreactor.[medical citation needed] Because of the difference in the manufacturing process, the FDA claims that the two products are biologically different.[medical citation needed] Myozyme is FDA approved for replacement therapy for infantile-onset Pompe disease.[9]\nIn July 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended the authorization of avalglucosidase alfa.[13] Avalglucosidase alfa (Nexviazyme) was approved for medical use in the United States in August 2021,[14][15] and in the European Union in June 2022.[16]\nIn December 2022, the EMA recommended the authorization of cipaglucosidase alfa.

    "Disease": "GM2-gangliosidosis, AB variant",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of GM2-gangliosidosis, AB variant are identical with those of infantile Tay–Sachs disease, except that enzyme assay testing shows normal levels of hexosaminidase A.[2] Infantile Sandhoff disease has similar symptoms and prognosis, except that there is deficiency of both hexosaminidase A and hexosaminidase B. Infants with this disorder typically appear normal until the age of 3 to 6 months, when development slows and muscles used for movement weaken. Affected infants lose motor skills such as turning over, sitting, and crawling. As the disease progresses, infants develop seizures, vision and hearing loss, mental retardation, and paralysis.[4]\nAn ophthalmological abnormality called a cherry-red spot, which can be identified with an eye examination, is characteristic of this disorder. This cherry-red spot is the same finding that Warren Tay first reported in 1881, when he identified a case of Tay–Sachs disease, and it has the same etiology.[5]\nThe prognosis for AB variant is the same as for infantile Tay–Sachs disease. Children with AB variant die in infancy or early childhood.[citation needed]",

    "Disease": "Gonadotropin-releasing hormone insensitivity",
    "Signs and symptoms": "There is a relatively broad spectrum of clinical signs and symptoms that can occur in, ranging from complete absence of sexual development to partial completion of puberty that does not subsequently progress. Of note, the X-linked form of Kallmann syndrome (KS) form of GnRH insensitivity relating to mutations in the ANOS1 gene has the most consistent severe phenotypic presentation (i.e., prepubertal testes size and complete absence of gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH]-induced luteinizing hormone [LH] pulsations during frequency sampling studies) of all of the genes associated with this condition.[1][2]\nGnRH insensitivity can present at any age, but the presenting signs and symptoms are a function of the age-related period of reproductive activity.[citation needed]\nDuring the neonatal period, boys with the more severe cases of GnRH insensitivity can present with microphallus and/or cryptorchidism, presumably due to in utero and/or neonatal GnRH deficiency; approximately one-half of boys with microphallus have GnRH insensitivity as the underlying diagnosis. In comparison, newborn girls with GnRH insensitivity have no obvious abnormal reproductive tract findings that might provide clues to the diagnosis. However, in both sexes, other congenital nonreproductive features may be present (e.g., midline facial defects, skeletal abnormalities).[citation needed]\nDuring childhood, since the hypothalamic GnRH-pituitary-gonadal axis is quiescent, a diagnosis of GnRH insensitivity can generally be heralded only in the presence of nonreproductive phenotypes (e.g., the lack of sense of smell in some patients [anosmia] or skeletal abnormalities, such as cleft lip/cleft palate, hearing deficits, or syndactyly).[citation needed]\nAt puberty, patients of both sexes can present with a complete form of GnRH insensitivity that is characterized by a failure to initiate sexual maturation (e.g., lack of secondary sexual characteristics, primary amenorrhea in girls, lack of virilization in boys) and failure to establish a pubertal growth spurt.[citation needed]\nSome patients present with partial forms of GnRH insensitivity and undergo some degree of pubertal development that subsequently ceases. For example, some males with GnRH insensitivity exhibit some testicular growth, while some females can have thelarche and menarche, but hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) is demonstrable soon thereafter. Extremely rarely, a few have completely normal pubertal development and adulthood gonadal function, only to develop HH with prepubertal levels of testosterone but sometimes with normal testicular size as a clue to its acquired status, i.e., developing only after adult testicular development has been complete subsequently in adulthood, leading to infertility and sexual dysfunction.[3] These patients are referred to as having the adult-onset or acquired form of GnRH insensitivity.[citation needed]",

    "Diagnosis": "When suspected on the basis of the clinical presentation or physical findings, the diagnosis of GnRH insensitivity should be confirmed biochemically. The diagnosis requires the following findings:[citation needed]\n• The demonstration of prepubertal serum concentrations of sex steroid hormones (serum testosterone less than 100 ng/dL [3.5 nmol/L] in males or serum estradiol less than 20 pg/mL [73 pmol/L] in females).\n• Inappropriately low or normal serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations (usually less than 4 to 5 international units/L) rather than the high concentrations expected with primary gonadal failure.\n• Otherwise normal anterior pituitary function.\n• Normal appearance of the hypothalamus and pituitary region on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); when seeking this diagnosis, it is useful to request fine (1 mm) cuts through the olfactory bulb region of the MRI to define subtle abnormalities of the olfactory system that may signal which genetic tests to request first.\n• Differential diagnosis — For patients fulfilling the above laboratory criteria, the main (and most difficult) differential diagnosis is with constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP).\n• A definitive diagnosis of GnRH insensitivity in the absence of a family history or prior genetic testing is difficult to make until the patient reaches at least 18 years of age, unless other suggestive features are present (i.e., prior microphallus and/or cryptorchism, anosmia, renal agenesis, skeletal defects, etc.). CDGP is far more common than GnRH insensitivity, affecting approximately 3 percent of adolescents while the incidence of the Kallmann syndrome (KS) form of GnRH insensitivity is 1:48,000 with a clear difference between males (1:30,000) and females (1:125,000).[5]\n• No single test can reliably distinguish between GnRH insensitivity and CDGP until more widespread genetic testing becomes available, and therefore, one has to rely on an array of clinical clues as well as on the natural evolution over time. However, certain features may indicate a higher likelihood of GnRH insensitivity rather than CDGP:\n• A family history of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency, anosmia, and/or the presence of one or several associated congenital abnormalities suggests congenital nonreproductive abnormalities (e.g., cleft lip/palate, syndactyly) suggest KS form of GnRH deficiency.\n• A history of \"stalled\" puberty rather than total absence of development, a family history of delayed puberty, or early evidence of breast or testicular development are useful indicators that puberty is likely to occur spontaneously (i.e., CDGP).\n• The presence of pubic hair suggests GnRH insensitivity because normal adrenarche still occurs; in comparison, both adrenarche and gonadarche are delayed in CDGP, and therefore, pubic hair is usually absent.\n• In females, functional hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (FHH) (or functional hypothalamic amenorrhea) is part of the differential diagnosis for GnRH insensitivity. The presence of predisposing factors like excessive exercise, weight loss, or psychological stress point towards the diagnosis of FHH rather than GnRH insensitivity.\n• When GnRH deficiency presents after puberty,[3] other causes of secondary hypogonadism (particularly tumors of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis) must be eliminated, as GnRH insensitivity is really a diagnosis of exclusion. These include:\n• Tumors of the hypothalamic-pituitary region that occasionally can be suspected by the presence of other neurologic symptoms (headaches, visual disturbances) or the demonstration of other defects or excess in anterior pituitary hormone secretion on initial biochemical screening. However, enlarging mass lesions in either the pituitary or the central nervous system decrease the secretion of corticotropin (ACTH) or thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) less than that of gonadotropins or growth hormone.\n• Similarly, hemochromatosis should be eliminated by appropriate testing of serum iron, total iron binding capacity, and ferritin levels.\nApproach to genetic testing — When the diagnosis of GnRH insensitivity is suspected, it is suggested that referral to a clinical geneticist for further evaluation and possible genetic testing be done. As many of the genes causing GnRH insensitivity have pleotropic physiologic functions, genetic testing can aid assessment of both reproductive and nonreproductive clinical features. In addition, ascertaining the specific inheritance modes can aid genetic screening within the family to predict recurrence risk in siblings, family members or offspring of GnRH insensitivity patients. However, genetic testing in GnRH insensitivity is challenging, given the genetic and allelic heterogeneity, as well as complex oligogenic inheritance patterns. However, in the presence of either clear Mendelian inheritance patterns or specific phenotypic cues, targeted genetic testing or multigene panel testing may be performed. However, if such testing is done, variant interpretation and genetic counseling should be performed in conjunction with a clinical genetics service. Alternatively, several research units have special interests in the genetics of GnRH insensitivity, and clinicians can consider referring these patients to such specialized centers. Genetic testing is now commercially available through several Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) laboratories in the United States (GeneDx, Athena Diagnostics, Fulgent Diagnostics).[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "The choice of therapy for GnRH insensitivity depends upon the patient's age and desire to achieve one or more of the following goals:[citation needed]\n• Induction of puberty and/or maintenance of sexual maturation\n• Induction or restoration of fertility\nPuberty induction and sexual maturation\nGirls and women — Exogenous estrogens are used to start secondary sexual development in prepubertal girls and to build and sustain normal bone and muscle mass. Initiation of treatment are based upon the patient's bone age, current height percentiles, psychosexual needs, and predicted adult height. The shorter the predicted adult height, the later puberty should be induced. Inappropriate use of estrogens may result in rapid osseous maturation with resulting short stature and irregular menstrual bleeding.[citation needed]\nInitiation of puberty can begin with any type or route of exogenous estrogen, oral or transdermal. Initiation of puberty with transdermal 17-beta estradiol, starting with low doses of approximately 0.08 to 0.12 mcg estradiol per kg/day body weight, is successful and commonly prescribed by pediatricians.[6] The dose is then gradually increased over several years. Initial therapy consist of unopposed estrogen alone to maximize breast growth, achieve appropriate skeletal maturation, and to induce uterine and endometrial proliferation. A progestin eventually needs to be added to prevent endometrial hyperplasia, but adding it prematurely or administering combinations of estrogens and progestins (e.g., birth control pills) before completion of breast development should be avoided because it is likely to reduce ultimate breast size.[citation needed]\nOnce pubertal induction is completed, estrogen and progestin therapy are continued indefinitely. Doses and principles of therapy are similar to those for women with primary ovarian insufficiency.[citation needed]\nBoys and men — In boys, puberty can be induced with testosterone, exogenous gonadotropins, or pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) therapy. The latter two options also induce spermatogenesis, which is not necessary for this age group. Testosterone therapy is suggested for pubertal induction in boys. The goals of therapy are to:[citation needed]\n• Induce virilization\n• Promote optimal skeletal maturation (with bone age monitoring)\n• Maximize adult height\n• Promote psychosexual development\n• Build and sustain normal bone and muscle mass\nOral testosterone preparations should not be used, because of hepatic toxicity. The choices for testosterone replacement include intramuscular injections of long-acting testosterone preparations or topical gels/solutions/patches. Serum testosterone levels should be monitored and dose adjusted.[citation needed]\nWhichever form of testosterone replacement is chosen, providing psychological support is important because the patient will have a variety of new and often confusing symptoms, much like an adolescent undergoing puberty but more difficult because it will likely be at a later age. Testosterone therapy should be initiated at a low dose and gradually increased to an adult dose over a few years.[citation needed]\nOnce pubertal induction is completed, testosterone therapy is continued indefinitely.[citation needed]",

    "Disease": "Gorham's disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The symptoms of Gorham's disease vary depending on the bones involved. It may affect any part of the skeleton, but the most common sites of disease are the shoulder, skull, pelvic girdle, jaw, ribs, and spine.[4][5][6][7]\nIn some cases, no symptoms are seen until a fracture occurs either spontaneously or following minor trauma, such as a fall. An acute onset of localized pain and swelling may occur. More commonly, pain of no apparent cause increases in frequency and intensity over time and may eventually be accompanied by weakness and noticeable deformity of the area. The rate of progression is unpredictable, and the prognosis can be difficult. The disease may stabilize after a number of years, go into spontaneous remission, or in cases involving the chest and upper spine, prove fatal. Recurrence of the disease following remission can also occur. Involvement of the spine and skull base may cause a poor outcome from neurological complications. In many cases, the result of Gorham's disease is severe deformity and functional disability.[4][5][8]\nSymptoms such as difficulty breathing and chest pain may be present if the disease is present in the ribs, scapula, or thoracic vertebrae. These may indicate that the disease has spread from the bone into the chest cavity. The breathing problems may be misdiagnosed as asthma, because the damage done to the lungs can cause the same types of changes to lung function testing as seen in asthma.[6] Extension of the lesions into the chest may lead to the development of chylous pleural and pericardial effusions. Chyle is rich in protein and white blood cells that are important in fighting infection. The loss of chyle into the chest can have serious consequences, including infection, malnutrition, and respiratory distress and failure. These complications or their symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, poor growth or weight loss, and infection have sometimes been the first indications of the condition.[6][7][8]",
    "Cause": "The specific cause of Gorham's disease remains unknown. Bone mass and strength are obtained and maintained through a lifelong process of bone destruction and replacement that occurs at the cellular level. Cells called osteoclasts secrete enzymes that dissolve old bone, allowing another type of cells called osteoblasts to form new bone. Except in growing bone, the rate of breakdown equals the rate of building, thereby maintaining bone mass. In Gorham's disease, that process is disrupted.[2][3][4][9][10][11]\nGorham and Stout found that vascular anomalies always occupied space that normally would be filled with new bone and speculated that the presence of angiomatosis may lead to chemical changes in the bone.[2][9] Gorham and others speculated that such a change in the bone chemistry might cause an imbalance in the rate of osteoclast to osteoblast activity such that more bone is dissolved than is replaced.[9] Beginning in the 1990s, elevated levels of a protein called interleukin-6 (IL-6) being detected in people with the disease were reported, leading some to suggest that increased levels of IL-6 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) may contribute to the chemical changes Gorham and others believed were the cause of this type of osteolysis.[4][12]\nIn 1999, Möller and colleagues[4] concluded, \"The Gorham-Stout syndrome may be, essentially, a monocentric bone disease with a focally increased bone resorption due to an increased number of paracrine – or autocrine – stimulated hyperactive osteoclasts. The resorbed bone is replaced by a markedly vascularized  fibrous tissue. The apparent contradiction concerning the presence or absence or the number of osteoclasts, may be explained by the different phases of the syndrome.\" They further stated that their histopathological study provided good evidence that osteolytic changes seen in Gorham's disease are the result of hyperactive osteoclastic bone. However, others have concluded that lymphangiomatosis and Gorham's disease should be considered as a spectrum of disease rather than separate diseases.[13]\nWhile a consensus exists that Gorham's is caused by deranged osteoclastic activity,[2][4][9][11] no conclusive evidence has been found as to what causes this behavior to begin.",
    "Diagnosis": "In 1983, Heffez and colleagues[10] published a case report in which they suggested eight criteria for a definitive diagnosis of Gorham's disease:[citation needed]\n• Positive biopsy with the presence of angiomatous tissue\n• Absence of cellular atypia\n• Minimal or no osteoblastic response or dystrophic calcifications\n• Evidence of local bone progressive osseous resorption\n• Nonexpansile, nonulcerative lesions\n• No involvement of viscera\n• Osteolytic radiographic pattern\n• Negative hereditary, metabolic, neoplastic, immunologic, or infectious etiology\nIn the early stages of the disease, X-rays reveal changes resembling patchy osteoporosis. As the disease progresses, bone deformity occurs with further loss of bone mass, and in the tubular bones (the long bones of the arms and legs), a concentric shrinkage is often seen which has been described as having a \"sucked candy\" appearance. Once the cortex (the outer shell) of the bone has been disrupted, vascular channels may invade adjacent soft tissues and joints. Eventually, complete or near-complete resorption of the bone occurs and may extend to adjacent bones, though spontaneous arrest of bone loss has been reported on occasion. Throughout this process, as the bone is destroyed, it is replaced by angiomatous and/or fibrous tissue.[2][3][4][11][14]\nOften, Gorham's disease is not recognized until a fracture occurs, with subsequent improper bone healing. The diagnosis is essentially one of exclusion and must be based on combined clinical, radiological, and histopathological findings.[4] X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, ultrasounds, and nuclear medicine (bone scans) are all important tools in the diagnostic workup and surgical planning, but none has the ability alone to produce a definitive diagnosis. Surgical biopsy with histological identification of the vascular or lymphatic proliferation within a generous section of the affected bone is an essential component in the diagnostic process.[4][5][8]\nRecognition of the disease requires a high index of suspicion and an extensive workup. Because of its serious morbidity, Gorham's must always be considered in the differential diagnosis of osteolytic lesions.[3]",
    "Treatment": "N/A",
    "Management": "Treatment of Gorham's disease is for the most part palliative and limited to symptom management.[citation needed]\nSometimes, the bone destruction spontaneously ceases and no treatment is required, but when the disease is progressive, aggressive intervention may be necessary. Duffy and colleagues[6] reported that around 17% of people with Gorham's disease in the ribs, shoulder, or upper spine experience extension of the disease into the chest, leading to chylothorax with its serious consequences, and that the mortality rate in this group can reach as high as 64% without surgical intervention.\nA search of the medical literature reveals multiple case reports of interventions with varying rates of success as follows:[citation needed]\nCardiothoracic (heart and lung):\nSkeletal:"

    "Signs and symptoms": "Aside from the visible rash, granuloma annulare is usually asymptomatic. Sometimes the rash may burn or itch. People with GA usually notice a ring of small, firm bumps (papules) more commonly over the backs of the forearms, hands or feet, often centered on joints or knuckles. GA, however, can be anywhere on the body and has also been seen on necks, backs, ankles and wrists. Bumps are caused by the clustering of T cells below the skin. These papules start as very small, pimple looking bumps, which spread over time from that size to dime, quarter, half-dollar size and beyond. Occasionally, multiple rings may join into one. Rarely, GA may appear as a firm nodule under the skin of the arms or legs.  It also occurs on the sides and circumferential at the waist and without therapy can continue to be present for many years. Outbreaks continue to develop at the edges of the aging rings.[citation needed]",
    "Cause": "The condition is usually seen in otherwise healthy people. Occasionally, it may be associated with diabetes or thyroid disease.

If local treatment fails it may be treated with systemic corticosteroids.[15][16] Treatment success varies widely, with most patients finding only brief success with the above-mentioned treatments. Most lesions of granuloma annulare disappear in pre-pubertal patients with no treatment within two years while older patients (50+) have rings for upwards of 20 years.

    "Cause": "The cause of GPA is unknown, although microbes, such as bacteria and viruses, as well as genetics, have been implicated in its pathogenesis.[13][19]",
    "Diagnosis": "Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is usually suspected only when a person has had unexplained symptoms for a long period. The determination of ANCAs can aid in diagnosing GPA, but positivity is not conclusive, and negative ANCAs are insufficient to reject the diagnosis. More than 90% of people who have GPA test positive for ANCAs.[20] Cytoplasmic-staining ANCAs that react with the enzyme proteinase 3 (cANCA) in neutrophils (a type of white blood cells) are associated with GPA.[12] Involvement of the ears, nose, and throat is more common in granulomatosis with polyangiitis than in the similar condition microscopic polyangiitis.[7]\nIf the person has signs of kidney involvement or cutaneous vasculitis, a biopsy is obtained from the kidneys. Rarely, a thoracoscopic lung biopsy is required. On histopathological examination, a biopsy will show leukocytoclastic vasculitis with necrotic changes and granulomatous inflammation (clumps of typically arranged white blood cells) on microscopy. These granulomas are the main reason for the name granulomatosis with polyangiitis, although they are not an essential feature. Nevertheless, necrotizing granulomas are a hallmark of this disease. Many biopsies can be nonspecific, though, and 50% provide too little information for the diagnosis of GPA.[12]",

    "Disease": "Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Individuals with GAMT deficiency appear normal at birth.[4] Shortly after birth, infants may start to show signs, as the consequences of decreased creatine levels in their body become more apparent.[4] Symptoms generally begin during early infancy (3–6 months) to age two years.[4] These clinical findings are relatively non-specific and do not immediately suggest a disorder of creatine metabolism. The most consistent clinical manifestation is developmental delay or intellectual disability, which is observed in all affected individuals, and can range from mild to severe.[4] Most individuals have severe developmental delay or intellectual disability (50-75%).[4] The next most consistent symptom is a behavior disorder, such as hyperactivity, autism, or self-injurious behavior, reported in 75% of GAMT deficient individuals.[4] The third most consistent symptom is seizures, reported in more than 70% of affected individuals.[4] Additional symptoms include movement disorders, such as chorea, athetosis, dystonia or ataxia, observed in about 30% of GAMT patients.[4]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "GAMT deficiency can be suspected from clinical findings, although clinical findings are not suggestive of a specific diagnosis. The initial diagnosis is typically established via measurement of creatine, creatinine, and guanidinoacetate in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, or dried blood spots.[5] These measurements can distinguish among the different cerebral creatine deficiency disorders. In GAMT deficiency, laboratory testing of plasma will show decreased levels of creatine and increased levels of guanidinoacetate.[5] A definitive diagnosis requires DNA sequencing of the GAMT gene and/or GAMT enzymatic activity assays.[5] Brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy can also be used in diagnosis, and will show decreased levels of creatine in affected individuals.[5] However, as this finding is seen in all three cerebral creatine deficiencies, further testing is needed to identify the specific defect.[5]\nTreatment is most effective for GAMT deficiency with early diagnosis; however, the non-specific clinical findings mean a diagnosis is often delayed. Due to the efficacy of early treatment and the lengthy typical diagnostic journey, GAMT deficiency has been recommended for newborn screening by the United States Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children.[5] Newborn screening assays measure the amount of guanidinoacetate in a dried blood spot using tandem mass spectrometry. Abnormal results from a newborn screening test still need to be confirmed by testing in plasma or urine.[14]\nIn the United States, Utah started screening for GAMT deficiency in all newborns in 2015. New York started screening newborns in late 2018.[15] In 2020, a GAMT-positive infant was identified via newborn screening in Utah,[16] thus providing evidence that a case could be identified from newborn screening. A second infant was identified in New York in 2021.[16] In 2022, a federal advisory committee voted to include GAMT in the Recommended Universal Screening Panel starting in January 2023.[17] In addition to New York and Utah, California,[18] Pennsylvania,[19] Connecticut,[20] Delaware,[20] and Michigan[20] all currently screen for GAMT.\nAround the world, the state of Victoria, Australia began screening for GAMT in 2004,[17] leading to the diagnosis of a newborn at birth in 2022.[21] In Canada, the provinces of Ontario[22] and British Columbia[23] screen for GAMT.",
    "Treatment": "Treatment of GAMT deficiency focuses on restoration of depleted brain creatine with oral creatine supplementation in pharmacologic doses, and removal of toxic intermediate GAA via ornithine supplementation and arginine- or protein-restricted diet.[24][8] Sodium benzoate supplementation is also sometimes used to decrease GAA levels.[7]  All patients are reported to benefit from creatine supplementation, with possible improvements or stabilization in symptoms.[6] Seizures appear to reduce more with dietary arginine restriction and ornithine supplementation.[7] Despite treatment, none of the patients have been reported to return to completely normal developmental level, if significant damage had taken place before treatment.[8] Prior to the addition of GAMT deficiency to newborn screening panels, younger siblings of affected individuals may have been tested at birth and treated early.[24] This early treatment can result in outcomes that are very close to normal.[25]",

An estimated 30–40% of cases are due to the C73R mutation, which decreases stability of the enzyme and results in <1% of its activity.[9] Exposure to long-wave ultraviolet light causes the affected skin to thicken and produce vesicles that are prone to rupture and infection; these secondary infections, along with bone resorption, can lead to disfigurement of the sun-exposed face and extremities.[10]\nEnzyme dysfunction prevents the normal production of heme and hemolytic anemia is another common symptom, though a lack of hemolysis in this disease is possible.

Exposure to the sunlight can cause discomfort and result in blistering, consciousness of heat, and swelling and redness of the skin.[12]",
    "Cause": "Gunther disease is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes the enzyme uroporphyrinogen III synthase (UROS), located at human chromosome 10q25.2-q26.3.[4][14] The disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.[4] This means the defective gene is responsible for the disorder and is located on an autosome, and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder. When there is a homozygous mutation it causes a uroporphyrinogen III synthase and uroporphyrinogen cosynthase defect. When the enzyme uroporphyrinogen III synthase is reacting normally it results in the making of isomer III porphyrinogen, which is what is used to form heme. When isomer III porphyrinogen is not produced because of a poor production of uroporphyrinogen III synthase then isomer I porphyrinogen is made which will oxidize and give a reddish tint skin.[15][16]",
    "Diagnosis": "When diagnosing Congenital Erythroipoetic Porphyria (Gunther Disease) one must exclude other forms of porphyria. These include Hepatoerythropoietic Porphyria and rare homozygous variants of Variegate Porphyria, Hereditary Coproporphyria, and STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in Infancy (SAVI). Mild variants may be present similarly to Porphyria Cutanea Tarda. [citation needed]\nThere are four steps in establishing the diagnosis of any porphyria. First, a thorough history (particularly family history) and physical exam are performed with special attention paid to sun-exposed skin. Biochemical measurements of porphyrins and precursors in the urine, feces, and blood are necessary. Specialized labs are helpful in measuring activity of specific enzymes of the heme synthesis pathway and/or DNA and mutational analyses. In CEP, activity of uroporphyrinogen III synthase (the fourth enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway) will be markedly decreased. [citation needed]\nIn congenital erythropoietic porphyria, urine aminolavulanic acid and porphobilinogen are typically normal. However, uroporphyrin and coproporphyrin tend to be markedly elevated and moderately elevated, respectively, in the urine more than in the feces. Additionally, fecal protoporphyrin is typically mildly elevated.[citation needed]\nIn the red blood cells, uroporphyrin, coproporphyrin and protoporphyrin are all elevated, distinguishing this form of porphyria from the others. Finally, plasma analysis will demonstrate elevated uroporphyrin and coproporphyrin. [citation needed]\nOther nonspecific but helpful diagnostic clues are history of cutaneous photosensitivity, blistering, erosions, crusts and ulcerations leading to extensive scarring and deformation of the hands, loss of eyebrows, eyelashes with severe mutilation of cartilaginous structures like the nose, erythrodontia, and variable degree of hematologic involvement ranging from mild hemolytic anemia to intrauterine hydrops fetalis. Other early clues are red or violet staining of diapers.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "There are multiple ways to treat Gunther's diseases, but one of the most crucial things that a person with this disease can do is limit themselves from sun exposure or eliminate sun exposure altogether. There are some sunscreens that have undesirable effects such as tropical sunscreens, but other sunscreens containing zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are shown to provide protection due to those light-reflective agents. To block the ultraviolet and visible light wavelengths and get the protection that patients with Gunther's disease require, physical barriers are needed. It is also advised that patients wear protective clothing to block the sun from their skin. Plastic films can be attached to car windows and homes to filter out some of the wavelengths that could cause harm to someone's skin with this disease. Incandescent bulbs replace the normal fluorescent lamps. These bulbs release less light, which prevents the \"porphyrin-exciting\" wavelengths that fluorescent lights emit.[17]\nOther less beneficial treatments have been used to help treat Gunther's disease. These include oral beta-carotene and other treatments such as activated charcoal and cholestyramine, which are used to interrupt and stop the porphyrins from being reabsorbed in the body. The reason that these oral treatments are unreasonable is because they require an extremely large dose of medicine and therefore are not beneficial.[17]\nErythrocyte transfusions have been shown to be a successful measure in decreasing the appearance of the disease by trying to lower the erythropoiesis and circulating porphyrin levels. Unfortunately, having chronic erythrocyte transfusions can be extremely harmful to the body and can cause severe complications.[17]\nTo help with dry eye symptoms and visual function, topical lubrication can be used.\nA more invasive way to help treat Gunther's disease would be to have surgery. There have been numerous studies that have stated that bone marrow transplantation is successful.[18] This is a recently new development for Gunther's disease so the long-term effects are still unresourced. If a patient has a life-threatening infectious complication then bone marrow transplantation is no longer relevant for them.\nThere are also reports that stem cell transplantation is successful in a limited number of participants[17]",

    "Signs and symptoms": "Characteristic symptoms vary with severity. In general symptoms are internal or external bleeding episodes, which are called \"bleeds\".[18][19] People with more severe haemophilia experience more severe and more frequent bleeds, while people with mild haemophilia usually experience more minor symptoms except after surgery or serious trauma. In cases of moderate haemophilia symptoms are variable which manifest along a spectrum between severe and mild forms.[20]\nIn both haemophilia A and B, there is spontaneous bleeding but a normal bleeding time, normal prothrombin time, normal thrombin time, but prolonged partial thromboplastin time. Internal bleeding is common in people with severe haemophilia and some individuals with moderate haemophilia. The most characteristic type of internal bleed is a joint bleed where blood enters into the joint spaces.[21] This is most common with severe haemophiliacs and can occur spontaneously (without evident trauma). If not treated promptly, joint bleeds can lead to permanent joint damage and disfigurement.[21] Bleeding into soft tissues such as muscles and subcutaneous tissues is less severe but can lead to damage and requires treatment.[22]\nChildren with mild to moderate haemophilia may not have any signs or symptoms at birth, especially if they do not undergo circumcision. Their first symptoms are often frequent and large bruises and haematomas from frequent bumps and falls as they learn to walk. Swelling and bruising from bleeding in the joints, soft tissue, and muscles may also occur. Children with mild haemophilia may not have noticeable symptoms for many years. Often, the first sign in very mild haemophiliacs is heavy bleeding from a dental procedure, an accident, or surgery. Females who are carriers usually have enough clotting factors from their one normal gene to prevent serious bleeding problems, though some may present as mild haemophiliacs.[23]",

    "Diagnosis": "Haemophilia can be diagnosed before, during or after birth if there is a family history of the condition. Several options are available to parents. If there is no family history of haemophilia, it is usually only diagnosed when a child begins to walk or crawl. Affected children may experience joint bleeds or easy bruising.[36]\nMild haemophilia may only be discovered later, usually after an injury or a dental or surgical procedure.[37]",
    "Treatment": "The method for the production of an antihaemophilic factor was discovered by Judith Graham Pool from Stanford University in 1964,[80] and approved for commercial use in 1971 in the United States under the name Cryoprecipitated AHF.[81] Together with the development of a system for transportation and storage of human plasma in 1965, this was the first time an efficient treatment for haemophilia became available.[82]",

Areas where the skin folds, as well as the armpits, groin, neck, buttocks and under the breasts are most commonly affected. In addition to blistering, other symptoms which accompany HHD include acantholysis, erythema and hyperkeratosis.[5] It typically begins in late teenage years or in a person's 30s or 40s. [6]",
    "Cause": "The cause of the disease is a haploinsufficiency of the enzyme ATP2C1;[7] the ATP2C1 gene is located on chromosome 3, which encodes the protein hSPCA1. A mutation on one copy of the gene causes only half of this necessary protein to be made and the cells of the skin do not adhere together properly due to malformation of intercellular desmosomes, causing acantholysis, blisters and rashes.  There is no known cure.[6]",
    "Diagnosis": "N/A",
    "Treatment": "Topical steroid preparations often help outbreaks; use of the weakest corticosteroid that is effective is recommended to help prevent thinning of the skin. Drugs such as antibiotics, antifungals, corticosteroids, dapsone, methotrexate, thalidomide, etretinate, cyclosporine and, most recently, intramuscular alefacept may control the disease but are ineffective for severe chronic or relapsing forms of the disease. Intracutaneous injections of botulinum toxin to inhibit perspiration may be of benefit.[14] Maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding heat and friction of affected areas, and keeping the area clean and dry may help prevent flares.[citation needed]\nSome have found relief in laser resurfacing that burns off the top layer of the epidermis, allowing healthy non-affected skin to regrow in its place.[citation needed] Secondary bacterial, fungal and/or viral infections are common and may exacerbate an outbreak. Some have found that outbreaks are triggered by certain foods, hormone cycles and stress.\nIn many cases naltrexone, taken daily in low doses, appears to help.[15][16]",

    "Cause": "The cause is a genetic mutation in the MAPKinase pathway that occurs during early development.[1]\nThe origin is a dendritic cell, although previously thought to be a histiocyte, a term still used. The mutations causes white blood cells (lymphocytes, macrophages, and eosinophils) to move towards dendritic cells, resulting in damage in any organ except the heart and kidneys.[1]\nThe disease was once thought to be a lipid storage disease as the lesions have a high cholesterol content, but the blood cholesterol is usually normal.[5][13]\nSome sources such as the National Cancer Institute describe it as a type of cancer,[14] while other sources specifically state it is not a type of cancer.[15]",

    "Disease": "Harlequin syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The \"Harlequin sign\" is unilateral flushing and sweating of the face, neck, and upper chest usually after exposure to heat or strenuous exertion.[6] Horner syndrome, another problem associated with the sympathetic nervous system, is often seen in conjunction with harlequin syndrome.[citation needed]\nSince Harlequin syndrome is associated with a dysfunction in the autonomic nervous system, main symptoms of this dysfunction are in the following: Absence of sweat(anhidrosis) and flushing on one side of the face, neck, or upper thoracic area. In addition, other symptoms include cluster headaches, tearing of the eyes, nasal discharge, abnormal contraction of the pupils, weakness in neck muscles, and drooping of one side of the upper eyelid.[3]",
    "Cause": "One possible cause of Harlequin syndrome is a lesion to the preganglionic or postganglionic cervical sympathetic fibers and parasympathetic neurons of the ciliary ganglion.[7] It is also believed that torsion (twisting) of the thoracic spine can cause blockage of the anterior radicular artery leading to Harlequin syndrome.[8] The sympathetic deficit on the denervated side causes anhidrosis (lack of sweating). Patients with Horner's Syndrome may also experience this. The parasympathetic deficit on the denervated side causes the flushing of the opposite side to appear more pronounced. It is unclear whether or not the response of the undamaged side was normal or excessive, but it is believed that it could be a result of the body attempting to compensate for the damaged side and maintain homeostasis.[8]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis of Harlequin syndrome is made when the individual has consistent signs and symptoms of the condition, therefore, it is made by clinical observation. In addition, a neurologist or primary care physician may require an MRI test to rule out similar disorders such as Horner's syndrome, Adie's syndrome, and Ross' syndrome.[3] In an MRI, a radiologist may observe areas near brain or spinal cord for lesions, or any damage to the nerve endings. It is also important that the clinician rules out traumatic causes by performing autonomic function tests.[9] Such tests includes the following: tilt table test, orthostatic blood pressure measurement, head-up test, valsalva maneuver, thermoregulatory sweat test, tendon reflex test, and electrocardiography (ECG). CT scan of the heart and lungs may also be performed to rule out a structural underlying lesion.[10] The medical history of the individual should be carefully noted.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Harlequin syndrome is not debilitating, so treatment is not normally necessary.[6] In cases where the individual may feel socially embarrassed, contralateral sympathectomy may be considered, although compensatory flushing and sweating of other parts of the body may occur.[10] In contralateral sympathectomy, the nerve bundles that cause the flushing in the face are interrupted. This procedure causes both sides of the face to no longer flush or sweat. Since symptoms of Harlequin syndrome do not typically impair a person's daily life, this treatment is only recommended if a person is very uncomfortable with the flushing and sweating associated with the syndrome.[3]",

    "Disease": "Harlequin-type ichthyosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Newborns with harlequin-type ichthyosis present with thick, fissured armor-plate hyperkeratosis.[11] Sufferers feature severe cranial and facial deformities. The ears may be very poorly developed or absent, as may the nose. The eyelids may be everted (ectropion), which leaves the eyes and the area around them very susceptible to infection.[12] Babies with this condition often bleed during birth. The lips are pulled back by the dry skin (eclabium).[13]\nJoints sometimes lack movement and may be below the normal size. Hypoplasia is sometimes found in the fingers. Polydactyly has been found on occasion. The fish mouth appearance, mouth breathing, and xerostomia place affected individuals at extremely high risk for developing rampant dental decay.[14]\nPeople with this condition are extremely sensitive to changes in temperature due to their hard, cracked skin, which prevents normal heat loss. The skin also restricts respiration, which impedes the chest wall from expanding and drawing in enough air. This can lead to hypoventilation and respiratory failure. Patients are often dehydrated, as their plated skin is not well suited to retaining water.[13]",
    "Cause": "Harlequin-type ichthyosis is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the ABCA12 gene. This gene is important in regulating protein synthesis for the development of the skin layer. Mutations in the gene cause impaired transport of lipids in the skin layer and may also lead to shrunken versions of the proteins responsible for skin development. Less severe mutations result in a collodion membrane and congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma-like presentation.[15][16]\nABCA12 is an ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC transporter), which is a member of a large family of proteins that hydrolyze ATP to transport cargo across cell membranes. ABCA12 is thought to be a lipid transporter in keratinocytes necessary for lipid transport into lamellar granules during the formation of the lipid barrier in the skin.[17]",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of harlequin-type ichthyosis relies on both physical examination and laboratory tests. Physical assessment at birth is vital for the initial diagnosis of harlequin ichthyosis. Physical examination reveals characteristic symptoms of the condition, especially the abnormalities in the skin surface of newborns. Abnormal findings in physical assessments usually result in employing other diagnostic tests to ascertain the diagnosis.\nGenetic testing is the most specific diagnostic test for harlequin ichthyosis. This test reveals a loss of function mutation on the ABCA12 gene.[18] A skin biopsy may be done to assess the histologic characteristics of the cells. Histological findings usually reveal hyperkeratotic skin cells, which leads to a thick, white, and hard skin layer.",
    "Treatment": "Constant care is required to moisturize and protect the skin. The hard outer layer eventually peels off, exposing the vulnerable inner layers of the dermis. Early complications result from infection due to fissuring of the hyperkeratotic plates and respiratory distress due to physical restriction of chest wall expansion.[19]\nManagement includes supportive care and treatment of hyperkeratosis and skin barrier dysfunction. A humidified incubator is generally used. Intubation is often required until nares are present. Nutritional support with tube feeding is essential until eclabium resolves and infants can begin nursing. Ophthalmologic consultation is useful for the early management of ectropion, which is initially pronounced and resolves as scales are shed. Liberal application of petroleum jelly is needed multiple times daily.\nIn addition, careful debridement of constrictive bands of hyperkeratosis should be performed to avoid digital ischemia.[19] Cases of digital autoamputation or necrosis have been reported due to cutaneous constriction bands. Relaxation incisions have been used to prevent this complication.[19]",

    "Disease": "Hartnup disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Hartnup disease manifests during infancy with variable clinical presentation: failure to thrive, photosensitivity, intermittent ataxia, nystagmus, and tremor.[citation needed]\nNicotinamide is necessary for neutral amino acid transporter production in the proximal renal tubules found in the kidney, and intestinal mucosal cells found in the small intestine.  Therefore, a symptom stemming from this disorder results in increased amounts of amino acids in the urine.\nPellagra, a similar condition, is also caused by low nicotinamide; this disorder results in dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia.[citation needed]\nHartnup disease is a disorder of amino acid transport in the intestine and kidneys; otherwise, the intestine and kidneys function normally, and the effects of the disease occur mainly in the brain and skin. Symptoms may begin in infancy or early childhood, but sometimes they begin as late as early adulthood. Symptoms may be triggered by sunlight, fever, drugs, or emotional or physical stress.  A period of poor nutrition nearly always precedes an attack. The attacks usually become progressively less frequent with age.  Most symptoms occur sporadically and are caused by a deficiency of niacinamide.  A rash develops on parts of the body exposed to the sun.  Mental retardation, short stature, headaches, unsteady gait, and collapsing or fainting are common.  Psychiatric problems (such as anxiety, rapid mood changes, delusions, and hallucinations) may also result.[6]",
    "Cause": "Hartnup disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Heterozygotes are normal. Consanguinity is common. The failure of amino-acid transport was reported in 1960 from the increased presence of indoles (bacterial metabolites of tryptophan) and tryptophan in the urine of patients as part of a generalized aminoaciduria of the disease. The excessive loss of tryptophan from malabsorption was the cause of the pellagra like symptoms. From studies on ingestion of tryptophan it seemed that there was a generalized problem with amino-acid transport.[7]\nIn 2004, a causative gene, SLC6A19, was located on band 5p15.33. SLC6A19 is a sodium-dependent and chloride-independent neutral amino acid transporter, expressed predominantly in the kidneys and intestine.[8]",
    "Diagnosis": "The defective gene controls the absorption of certain amino acids from the intestine and the reabsorption of those amino acids in the kidneys. Consequently, a person with Hartnup disease cannot absorb amino acids properly from the intestine and cannot reabsorb them properly from tubules in the kidneys.  Excessive amounts of amino acids, such as tryptophan, are excreted in the urine.  The  body is thus left with inadequate amounts of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. With too little tryptophan in the blood, the body is unable to make a sufficient amount of the B-complex vitamin niacinamide, particularly under stress when more vitamins are needed.[6]\nIn Hartnup disease, urinary excretion of proline, hydroxyproline, and arginine remains unchanged, differentiating it from other causes of generalized aminoaciduria, such as Fanconi syndrome. With urine chromatography, increased levels of neutral amino acids (e.g., glutamine, valine, phenylalanine, leucine, asparagine, citrulline, isoleucine, threonine, alanine, serine, histidine, tyrosine, tryptophan) and indican are found in the urine. Increased urinary indican can be tested by Obermeyer test.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "A high-protein diet can overcome the deficient transport of neutral amino acids in most patients.  Poor nutrition leads to more frequent and more severe attacks of the disease, which is otherwise asymptomatic. All patients who are symptomatic are advised to use physical and chemical protection from sunlight: avoid excessive exposure to sunlight, wear protective clothing, and use  chemical sunscreens with a SPF of 15 or greater. Patients also should avoid other aggravating factors, such as photosensitizing drugs, as much as possible.  In patients with niacin deficiency and symptomatic disease, daily supplementation with nicotinic acid or nicotinamide reduces both the number and severity of attacks.  Neurologic and psychiatric treatment is needed in patients with severe central nervous system involvement.[8]",

This activity is almost ceaseless and movements are often complex and combined\". Hemiballismus is usually characterized by involuntary flinging motions of the extremities.[2] The movements are often violent and have wide amplitudes of motion.[9] They are continuous and random and can involve proximal or distal muscles on one side of the body. Some cases even include the facial muscles.[6] It is common for arms and legs to move together. The more a patient is active, the more the movements increase. With relaxation comes a decrease in movements.[10] Physicians can measure the severity of the disorder by having the patient perform a series of basic, predetermined tasks and counting the hemiballistic movements during a set time session.[11] The physicians then rate the patient on a severity scale. This scale gives scientists and clinicians a way to compare patients and determine the range of the disorder.[citation needed]\nThe name hemiballismus literally means \"half ballistic\", referring to the violent, flailing movements observed on one side of the body.",
    "Cause": "In examining the causes of hemiballismus, it is important to remember that this disorder is extremely rare. While hemiballismus can result from the following list, just because a patient has one of these disorders does not mean they will also experience hemiballismus.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis of hemiballismus is a clinical one, made with observation during clinical examination. Hemiballismus is a clinical sign with a number of different causes. Therefore, a diagnosis underlying this clinical sign should be sought. The observer should note sudden, flinging movements of a limb(s) and occasionally the face. This is commonly unilateral (\"Hemiballismus\"). The movements must be distinguished from other hyperkinetic movement disorders such as tremor (generally more rhythmic, and smaller amplitude) and chorea, akathisia and athetosis (all are often of lower amplitude and less violent).[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "When treating hemiballismus, it is first important to treat whatever may be causing the manifestation of this disorder. This could be hyperglycemia, infections, or neoplastic lesions. Some patients may not even need treatment because the disorder is not severe and can be self-limited.[10]",

    "Diagnosis": "Because of the ease of therapy (dietary exclusion of fructose), HFI can be effectively managed if properly diagnosed. In HFI, the diagnosis of homozygotes is difficult, requiring a genomic DNA screening with allele-specific probes or an enzyme assay from a liver biopsy. Once identified, parents of infants who carry mutant aldolase B alleles leading to HFI, or older individuals who have clinical histories compatible with HFI can be identified and counselled with regard to preventive therapy: dietary exclusion of foods containing fructose, sucrose, or sorbitol. If possible, individuals who suspect they might have HFI should avoid testing via fructose challenge as the results are non-conclusive for individuals with HFI, and even if the diagnostic administration of fructose is properly controlled, profound hypoglycemia and its sequelae can threaten the patient's well-being.[2]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment of HFI depends on the stage of the disease, and the severity of the symptoms. Stable patients without acute intoxication events are treated by careful dietary planning that avoids fructose and its metabolic precursors.

    "Disease": "Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Almost all women present with uterine fibroids, approximately 76% with dermal manifestations and 10–16% with renal tumors.[3]\nThe uterine fibroids tend to occur at younger age and are larger and more numerous than in the general population. They may be distinguishable from sporadic fibroids by special histological features such as prominent nucleoli with perinucleolar halos.[4]\nThe skin presentation is of asymmetrical, reddish-brown nodules or papules with a firm consistency, predominantly located on the limbs (multiple cutaneous leiomyoma), although they may occur anywhere, including the face. The lesions, which are typically painful and most often present during the third decade of life, are piloleiomyomata—a benign smooth muscle tumour arising from the arrectores pilorum muscles of the skin. These tumours may also arise in the tunica dartos of the scrotum and the mammillary muscle of the nipple (genital leiomyoma), the smooth muscle of blood vessels (angioleiomyoma) and the lung (pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis).[5] A pseudo-Darier sign may be present.\nThe renal cell carcinoma tends to be of the papillary (type 2) form and tends to occur more commonly in women than men with this syndrome. These cancers present earlier than is usual for renal cell carcinomas (typically in the twenties and thirties) and tend to be at relatively advanced stages at presentation. Tumours have rarely been reported in children. These tumours occur in ~20% of those with this mutation suggesting that other factors are involved in the pathogenesis.\nThese growths increase in size and number throughout the lifetime.[6] People with HLRCC have an approximately 15% chance of developing renal cell carcinoma in their lifetime.[7] This is most commonly type II papillary renal cell carcinoma, which is an aggressive form.[6]",
    "Cause": "HLRCC is an autosomal dominant condition caused by a mutation in the FH gene, which results in dysfunction of the citric acid cycle, leading to an accumulation of fumarate.[7][12]\nThe fumarate hydratase gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q42.3-43), spans 22 kilobases and has 10 exons; the first exon codes for a signal peptide.",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is made either by testing of the fumarate hydratase activity in cultured skin fibroblasts or lymphoblastoid cells and demonstrating reduced activity (≤60%) or by molecular genetic testing.[3] Special histologic features of fibroids may allow an early diagnosis in absence of other symptoms.[4]",
    "Treatment": "Leiomyomas do not typically require treatment unless they cause pain.[6] The skin lesions may be difficult to treat as they tend to recur after excision or destructive treatment.  Drugs which affect smooth muscle contraction, such as doxazosin, nitroglycerine, nifedipine and phenoxybenzamine, may provide pain relief.\nUterine fibroids can be treated with the same methods as sporadic uterine fibroids including anti-hormonal treatment, surgery, or embolisation. Substantially elevated risk of progression to or independent development of uterine leiomyosarcoma has been reported which may influence treatment methods.[3]\nThe predisposition to renal cell cancer calls for screening and, if necessary, urological management.\nTopical lidocaine patches have been reported to decrease the severity and frequency of pain associated with cutaneous leiomyomas.[17]",

Family history can provide an important clue to the diagnosis. This is supplemented by testing for the two genes in which pathogenic variants are known to cause HMO namely EXT1 and EXT2. A combination of sequence analysis and deletion analysis of the entire coding regions of both EXT1 and EXT2 detects pathogenic variants in 70–95% of affected individuals.[3][7] The hallmark of radiographic diagnosis is the presence of osteochondromas at the metaphyseal ends of long bones in which the cortex and medulla of the osteochondroma represent a continuous extension of  the host bone. This is readily demonstrable in radiographs of the knees.[3][1]",
    "Treatment": "The indications for surgical intervention in individuals with HMO vary across the medical literature. In general surgical treatment of HMO includes one or more of the following procedures: ostechondroma excision, gradual or acute bone lengthening such as the ulna lengthening, corrective osteotomies, temporary hemiepiphysiodesis to correct angular joint deformities such as distal radius hemiepiphysiodesis and medial distal tibial hemiepiphysiodesis.[1][3]  The success of surgery is not well-correlated with specific patient or disease characteristics, making it challenging to predict who will benefit most from intervention. Surgery may be most appropriate for patients with severe functional impairments, pain, or progressive deformities.[1][2]  To enhance the amount of evidence in the medical literature certain recommendations have been put forward. The construction of well-designed prospective studies that can provide a more clear relationship between surgical procedures, patient characteristics and outcomes is on high demand. Otherwise, following the current study designs will continue to raise more questions than answers.[1][2] Total hip arthroplasty has been used to remedy severe and painful HMO of the hip joint. Total hip arthroplasty in individuals with HMO is challenging because of distortion of anatomy and repeated surgeries performed to address complaints related to exostosis.[27]",

    "Disease": "Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type I",
    "Signs and symptoms": "At the beginning, affected individuals often notice the loss of pain and temperature sensation or all sensory modalities in their feet. As the disease progresses, the sensory abnormalities may extend up to the knees. However, they often do not notice sensory loss for a long time.[5] Many affected individuals only become aware of the disease when they notice painless injuries and burns or when they seek medical advice for slowly healing wounds or foot ulcers. Foot ulcerations may appear due to permanent pressure, such as long walks or badly fitting shoes. Minor wounds or blisters may then lead to deep foot ulcerations. Once infection occurs, complications such as inflammation and destruction of the underlying bones may follow.[1][2][3][6] Affected individuals who do not lose sensation may experience spontaneous pain.[3] In addition, many affected individuals exhibit, to a variable degree, symmetrical distal muscle weakness and wasting.[7][6]\nHSAN I is characterized by marked sensory disturbances mainly as the loss of pain and temperature sensation in the distal parts of the lower limbs. The loss of sensation can also extend to the proximal parts of the lower limbs and the upper limbs as the disease progresses.[2] Some affected individuals do not lose sensation, but instead experience severe shooting, burning, and lancinating pains in the limbs or in the trunk. Autonomic disturbances, if present, manifest as decreased sweating.[3][8] The degree of motor disturbances is highly variable, even within families, ranging from absent to severe distal muscle weakness and wasting.[1]\nThe disease progresses slowly, but often disables the affected individuals severely after a long duration. The onset of the disease varies between the 2nd and 5th decade of life,[2] albeit congenital or childhood onset has occasionally been reported.[1][9] With the progression of the disease, the affected individuals lose the ability to feel pain in their feet and legs. Minor injuries in the painless area can result in slow-healing wounds which, if not immediately recognized, can develop into chronic ulcerations. Once infection occurs, these ulcerations can result in severe complications that lead to foot deformity, such as inflammation of the underlying bones, spontaneous bone fractures, and progressive degeneration of weight-bearing joints. Furthermore, foot deformity promotes skin changes such as hyperkeratosis at pressure points. These complications may necessitate amputation of the affected foot.[3][8]\nBiopsies of severely affected sural nerve (short saphenous nerve) in patients with HSAN I showed evidence of neuronal degeneration. Only a very few myelinated fibers were observed some of which showed a sign of primary (segmental) demyelination. A reasonable number of unmyelinated axons remained, although the presence of stacks of flattened Schwann cell processes suggested unmyelinated axon loss.[1] Electrophysiological testing provides additional evidence that neuronal degeneration underlies the disease. Sensory potentials are usually absent in the lower limbs but are often recordable or even normal in the upper limbs of the patients.[1][3] In addition, motor conduction is slow, possibly implying a demyelinating process.[10][11]",
    "Cause": "Advances in molecular genetics have enabled identification of most genes associated with HSAN I. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the disease are not fully understood and are under investigation. One of challenges in the investigation is to elucidate how faulty genes that are ubiquitously expressed and are involved in basic cellular functions, such as sphingolipid metabolism, maintenance of organellar integrity, membrane dynamics, and transcription regulation, affect specific populations of neurons.[8]",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of HSAN I is based on the observation of symptoms described above and is supported by a family history suggesting autosomal dominant inheritance. The diagnosis is also supported by additional tests, such as nerve conduction studies in the lower limbs to confirm a sensory and motor neuropathy. In sporadic cases, acquired neuropathies, such as the diabetic foot syndrome and alcoholic neuropathy, can be excluded by the use of magnetic resonance imaging and by interdisciplinary discussion between neurologists, dermatologists, and orthopedics.[1][2]\nThe diagnosis of the disease has been revolutionized by the identification of the causative genes. The diagnosis is now based on the detection of the mutations by direct sequencing of the genes. Nevertheless, the accurate phenotyping of patients remains crucial in the diagnosis.[4] For pregnant patients, termination of pregnancy is not recommended.[1][2]\nHSAN I must be distinguished from hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN) and other types of hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSAN II-V). The prominent sensory abnormalities and foot ulcerations are the only signs to separate HSAN I from HMSN.[2][38][39] HSAN II can be differentiated from HSAN I as it is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, it has earlier disease onset, the sensory loss is diffused to the whole body, and it has less or no motor symptoms. HSAN III-V can be easily distinguished from HSAN I because of congenital disease onset. Moreover, these types exhibit typical features, such as the predominant autonomic disturbances in HSAN III or congenital loss of pain and anhidrosis in HSAN IV.[1][2]",
    "Treatment": "N/A",
    "Management": "Gene-based therapies for patients with HSAN I are not available to date, hence supportive care is the only treatment available for the patients. Ulcero-mutilating complications are the most serious, prominent, and leading diagnostic features in HSAN I. Since the complications mimic foot ulcers caused by diabetic neuropathy, the treatment for foot ulcers and infections can follow the guidelines given for diabetic foot care which starts with early and accurate counseling of patients about risk factors for developing foot ulcerations. Orthopedic care and the use of well fitting shoes without pressure points should also be included. Recently, the treatment of the foot complications has reached an efficient level allowing treatment on an outpatient basis. Early treatment of the foot complications often avoids hospitalization and, in particular, amputations. In sum, the principles of the treatment are removal of pressure to the ulcers, eradication of infection, and specific protective footwear afterwards.[1][2]"

    "Disease": "Hereditary spastic paraplegia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Symptoms depend on the type of HSP inherited. The main feature of the disease is progressive spasticity in the lower limbs due to pyramidal tract dysfunction. This also results in brisk reflexes, extensor plantar reflexes, muscle weakness, and variable bladder disturbances. Furthermore, among the core symptoms of HSP are also included abnormal gait and difficulty in walking, decreased vibratory sense at the ankles, and paresthesia.[8]\nIndividuals with HSP can experience extreme fatigue associated with central nervous system and neuromuscular disorders, which can be disabling.[9][10][11] Initial symptoms are typically difficulty with balance, stubbing the toe or stumbling. Symptoms of HSP may begin at any age, from infancy to older than 60 years. If symptoms begin during the teenage years or later, then spastic gait disturbance usually progresses over many years. Canes, walkers, and wheelchairs may eventually be required, although some people never require assistance devices.[12] Disability has been described as progressing more rapidly in adult onset forms.[13]\nMore specifically, patients with the autosomal dominant pure form of HSP reveal normal facial and extraocular movement. Although jaw jerk may be brisk in older subjects, there is no speech disturbance or difficulty of swallowing. Upper extremity muscle tone and strength are normal. In the lower extremities, muscle tone is increased at the hamstrings, quadriceps and ankles. Weakness is most notable at the iliopsoas, tibialis anterior, and to a lesser extent, hamstring muscles.[13]\nIn the complex form of the disorder, additional symptoms are present. These include: peripheral neuropathy, amyotrophy, ataxia, intellectual disability, ichthyosis, epilepsy, optic neuropathy, dementia, deafness, or problems with speech, swallowing or breathing.[14]\nAnita Harding[7] classified the HSP in a pure and complicated form. Pure HSP presents with spasticity in the lower limbs, associated with neurogenic bladder disturbance as well as lack of vibration sensitivity (pallhypesthesia). On the other hand, HSP is classified as complex when lower limb spasticity is combined with any additional neurological symptom.[citation needed]\nThis classification is subjective and patients with complex HSPs are sometimes diagnosed as having cerebellar ataxia with spasticity, intellectual disability (with spasticity), or  leukodystrophy.[7] Some of the genes listed below have been described in other diseases than HSP before. Therefore, some key genes overlap with other disease groups.[citation needed]",
    "Cause": "HSP is a group of genetic disorders. It follows general inheritance rules and can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive manner. The mode of inheritance involved has a direct impact on the chances of inheriting the disorder. Over 70 genotypes had been described, and over 50 genetic loci have been linked to this condition.[16] Ten genes have been identified with autosomal dominant inheritance. One of these, SPG4, accounts for ~50% of all genetically solved cases, or approximately 25% of all HSP cases.[15] Twelve genes are known to be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Collectively this latter group account for ~1/3 cases.[citation needed]\nMost altered genes have known function, but for some the function haven't been identified yet. All of them are listed in the gene list below, including their mode of inheritance.  Some examples are spastin (SPG4) and paraplegin (SPG7) are both AAA ATPases.[17]",
    "Diagnosis": "Initial diagnosis of HSPs relies upon family history, the presence or absence of additional signs and the exclusion of other nongenetic causes of spasticity, the latter being particular important in sporadic cases.[7]\nCerebral and spinal MRI is an important procedure performed in order to rule out other frequent neurological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, but also to detect associated abnormalities such as cerebellar or corpus callosum atrophy as well as white matter abnormalities. Differential diagnosis of HSP should also exclude spastic diplegia which presents with nearly identical day-to-day effects and even is treatable with similar medicines such as baclofen and orthopedic surgery; at times, these two conditions may look and feel so similar that the only perceived difference may be HSP's hereditary nature versus the explicitly non-hereditary nature of spastic diplegia (however, unlike spastic diplegia and other forms of spastic cerebral palsy, HSP cannot be reliably treated with selective dorsal rhizotomy).[citation needed]\nUltimate confirmation of HSP diagnosis can only be provided by carrying out genetic tests targeted towards known genetic mutations.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "No specific treatment is known that would prevent, slow, or reverse HSP. Available therapies mainly consist of symptomatic medical management and promoting physical and emotional well-being.[citation needed] Therapeutics offered to HSP patients include:\n• Baclofen – a voluntary muscle relaxant to relax muscles and reduce tone. This can be administered orally or intrathecally. (Studies in HSP [22][23][24])\n• Tizanidine – to treat nocturnal or intermittent spasms (studies available [25][26])\n• Diazepam and clonazepam – to decrease intensity of spasms[citation needed]\n• Oxybutynin chloride – an involuntary muscle relaxant and spasmolytic agent, used to reduce spasticity of the bladder in patients with bladder control problems[citation needed]\n• Tolterodine tartrate – an involuntary muscle relaxant and spasmolytic agent, used to reduce spasticity of the bladder in patients with bladder control problems[citation needed]\n• Cro System – to reduce muscle overactivity (existing studies for spasticity [27][28][29])\n• Botulinum toxin – to reduce muscle overactivity (existing studies for HSP patients[30][31])\n• Antidepressants (such as selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors) – for patients experiencing clinical depression[citation needed]\n• Physical therapy – to restore and maintain the ability to move; to reduce muscle tone; to maintain or improve range of motion and mobility; to increase strength and coordination; to prevent complications, such as frozen joints, contractures, or bedsores.[citation needed]",

This theory includes most of these potential indicators:[17]\n• Post-pubescent individuals[18]\n• Blocked hair follicles or blocked apocrine sweat glands\n• Excessive sweating\n• Androgen dysfunction\n• Genetic disorders that alter cell structure\nThe historical understanding of the disease suggests dysfunctional apocrine glands[19] or dysfunctional hair follicles,[20] possibly triggered by a blocked gland, which creates inflammation, pain, and a swollen lesion.",

    "Signs and symptoms": "Typically, Hirschsprung disease is diagnosed shortly after birth, although it may develop well into adulthood,  because of the presence of megacolon, or because the baby fails to pass the first stool (meconium)[9] within 48 hours of delivery.  Normally, 90% of babies pass their first meconium within 24 hours, and 99% within 48 hours.[10]\nSome other signs and symptoms in newborns include a swollen belly, vomiting (green or brown vomit), and flatulence. In older children, some other signs and symptoms include chronic constipation, flatulence, swollen belly, fatigue, and failure to thrive.[11]\nOther symptoms include symptoms of bowel perforation such as vomiting, constipation, poor feeding, lethargy, and diarrhea. Symptoms of bowel obstruction would include vomiting of bile and abdominal distension. Those who do not pass stools after 36 to 48 hours after birth should raise suspicion of Hirschsprung disease. Such suspicion can also be risen if there is only passage of stools after suppository, rectal exam, or enema. Children who do not respond to constipation treatment for six months should also raise suspicion of such disease. Enterocolitis, an acute complication of Hirschsprung disease, is characterised by sudden onset of fever, abdominal distension, vomiting, passage of bloody stools or release of explosive gas or stools after rectal examination.[12]\nSome cases are diagnosed later, into childhood, but usually before age 10.[9] The child may experience fecal retention, constipation, or abdominal distention.[9]",
    "Cause": "The disorder may occur by itself or in association with other genetic disorders such as Down syndrome.[2] About half of isolated cases are linked to a specific genetic mutation and about 20% occur within families.[1] Some of these occur in an autosomal dominant manner.[1] The cause of the remaining cases is unclear.[1] If otherwise normal parents have one child with the condition, the next child has a 4% risk of being affected.[2]",
    "Diagnosis": "Definitive diagnosis is made by suction biopsy of the distally narrowed segment.[30] A histologic examination of the tissue would show a lack of ganglionic nerve cells. Diagnostic techniques involve anorectal manometry,[31] barium enema, and rectal biopsy. The suction rectal biopsy is considered the current international gold standard in the diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease.[32]\nRadiologic findings may also assist with diagnosis.[33] An abdominal x-ray can reveal a lack of stool in the large intestine or a bulging caused by blocked stool.[34] Cineanography (fluoroscopy of contrast medium passing anorectal region) assists in determining the level of the affected intestines.[35]",

Other symptoms may include visual impairment, lack of growth, deafness, blindness, spastic quadriparesis (paralysis), and intellectual deficits.[6]\nSome infants may have additional abnormalities at birth including seizures, myoclonus (involuntary sudden, rapid jerks), limited thermoregulation abilities, and respiratory problems. Still other infants display no obvious symptoms at birth, going many months without a confirmed diagnosis of hydranencephaly. In some cases severe hydrocephalus, or another cephalic condition, is misdiagnosed.[7][8]",
    "Cause": "Hydranencephaly is an extreme form of porencephaly, which is characterized by a cyst or cavity in the cerebral hemispheres.[9][10]\nAlthough the exact cause of hydranencephaly remains undetermined in most cases, the most likely general cause is by vascular insult, such as stroke, injury, intrauterine infections, or traumatic disorders after the first trimester of pregnancy. In a number of cases where intrauterine infection was determined to be the causative factor, most involved toxoplasmosis and viral infections such as enterovirus, adenovirus, parvovirus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, Epstein-Barr, and syncytial viruses. Another cause factor is monochorionic twin pregnancies, involving the death of one twin in the second trimester, which in turn causes vascular exchange to the living twin through placental circulation through twin-to-twin transfusion, causing hydranencephaly in the surviving fetus.[11] One medical journal reports hydranencephaly as an autosomal inherited disorder with an unknown mode of transmission, causing a blockage of the carotid artery where it enters the cranium; this causes obstruction and damage to the cerebral cortex.[3]",
    "Diagnosis": "An accurate, confirmed diagnosis is generally impossible until after birth, though prenatal diagnosis using fetal ultrasonography (ultrasound) can identify characteristic physical abnormalities. After birth, diagnosis may be delayed for several months because the infant's early behavior appears to be relatively normal.  The most accurate diagnostic techniques are thorough clinical evaluation (considering physical findings and a detailed patient history); advanced imaging techniques, such as angiography, computerized tomography (CT scan), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); and (more rarely) transillumination.[3] However, diagnostic literature fails to provide a clear distinction between severe obstructive hydrocephalus and hydranencephaly, leaving some children with an unsettled diagnosis.[12]\nPreliminary diagnosis may be made in utero via standard ultrasound, and can be confirmed with a standard anatomy ultrasound. Hydranencephaly is sometimes misdiagnosed as bilaterally symmetric schizencephaly (a less destructive developmental process on the brain), severe hydrocephalus (cerebrospinal fluid excess within the skull), or alobar holoprosencephaly (a neurological developmental anomaly).\nOnce destruction of the brain is complete, the cerebellum, midbrain, thalami, basal ganglia, choroid plexus, and portions of the occipital lobes typically remain preserved to varying degrees. The cerebral cortex is absent; however, in most cases, the fetal head remains enlarged due to increased intracranial pressure, which results from inadequate reabsorption of the cerebrospinal fluid produced in the choroid plexus.[11]",

    "Disease": "Hyperacusis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Hyperacusis symptoms can include an increased perception of the loudness of sounds (loudness hyperacusis), pain (noxacusis/pain hyperacusis/sound-induced otalgia), annoyance, and/or fear in response to sounds by which most people are unaffected. It may affect one or both ears.[12] The majority of patients experience bilateral symptoms but often have one ear that is more affected than the other. Annoyance hyperacusis is often considered synonymous with misophonia. Fear hyperacusis is often considered synonymous with phonophobia. Many researchers more narrowly define hyperacusis to only include loudness hyperacusis and pain hyperacusis.[12]\nHyperacusis can also be accompanied by tinnitus. The latter is more common[13] and there are important differences between their involved mechanisms.[3]\nHyperacusis can result in anxiety and stress. Avoidant behavior is often a response to prevent the effects of hyperacusis and this can include avoiding social situations.[14]",
    "Cause": "The most common cause of hyperacusis is overexposure to excessively high decibel (sound pressure) levels, which can cause acoustic trauma.[1] An acoustic shock, which can lead to symptoms such as hyperacusis and ear pain, can also occur after exposure to an unexpected moderately loud to loud noise, even if this does not necessarily result in permanent cochlear damage.[7]\nSome affected people acquire hyperacusis suddenly as a result of taking ototoxic drugs (which can damage the cells responsible for hearing), Lyme disease, Ménière's disease, head injury, or surgery. Others are born with sound sensitivity or develop superior canal dehiscence syndrome.[33] Bell's palsy can trigger hyperacusis if the associated flaccid paralysis affects the tensor tympani, and stapedius, two small muscles of the middle ear.[34] Paralysis of the stapedius muscle prevents its function in dampening the oscillations of the ossicles, causing sound to be abnormally loud on the affected side.[35] Age may also be a significant factor, with younger patients exhibiting more severe hyperacusis.[11]\nRecently, it has been discovered that individuals with one copy of the GJB2 (Cx26) genetic mutation exhibit hearing that is more sensitive than average, akin to hyperacusis. These individuals appear to be at greater risk for damage from noise.[36]\nSome psychoactive drugs such as LSD, methaqualone, benzodiazepines, or phencyclidine can cause hyperacusis.[11][37] An antibiotic, ciprofloxacin, has also been seen to be a cause, known as ciprofloxacin-related hyperacusis.[38] Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome is also a possible cause.[39][40]",
    "Diagnosis": "The basic diagnostic test is similar to a normal audiogram. The difference is that, in addition to the hearing threshold at each test frequency, the lowest uncomfortable sound level is also measured. This level is called loudness discomfort level (LDL) or uncomfortable loudness level (ULL). In patients with hyperacusis this level is often considerably lower than in normal subjects, and usually across most parts of the auditory spectrum.[1][42] However, there is not a consensus regarding what constitutes a normal LDL. The relationship between LDL's and self-reported ability to tolerate sounds in everyday life in unclear.[43]\nIn addition to self-report questionnaires, audiologists may employ a variety of other techniques to evaluate auditory function in patients experiencing noise sensitivity. When conducting testing that involves the presentation of sounds, which may cause the patient discomfort or pain, it is vital to inform the patient of the volume and duration of sounds to be presented prior to testing. Care should be taken to begin with sounds of low volume, and volume should be increased gradually. The audiologist and patient should both be prepared to stop testing at any time, depending on the patient's symptoms.[43]",
    "Treatment": "There are currently no evidence-based guidelines regarding the treatment of patients with hyperacusis. The majority of audiologists report insufficient formal education in this area, likely due in part to the current lack of consensus in the literature regarding definitions and treatment of hyperacusis.[44] Dr. Kelly Jahn surveyed 32 patients[45] with severe pain hyperacusis and found that 95% of them had experienced a lack of empathy or support from doctors (20% somewhat agree and 75% strongly agree, with a 5% non response rate).[46]",

    "Disease": "Hyperekplexia",

The link to some cases of sudden infant death remains controversial.[3]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "There are three signs used to diagnose if an infant has hereditary hyperekplexia: if the child's body is stiff all over as soon as they are born, if they overreact to noises and other stimuli, and if the reaction to stimuli is followed by an overall stiffness where the child is unable to make any voluntary movements.[17] A combination of electroencephalogram and an electromyogram may help diagnose this condition in patients who have not displayed symptoms as children. The electroencephalogram will not show abnormal activity other than a spike in wakefulness or alertness, while the electromyogram will show rapid muscular responses and hyperreflexia. Otherwise, genetic testing is the only definitive diagnosis.[17] MRIs and CT scans will be normal unless other conditions are present.[17]",
    "Treatment": "The most commonly used effective treatment is clonazepam, which leads to the increased efficacy of another inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA.[3] There are anecdotal reports of the use of levetiracetam in genetic and acquired hyperekplexia.[18] During attacks of hypertonia and apnea, the limbs and head may be forcibly manipulated towards the trunk in order to resolve the symptoms.

Factors that can trigger attacks include rest after exercise, potassium-rich foods, stress, fatigue, weather changes, certain pollutants (e.g., cigarette smoke) and fasting.[2] Muscle strength often improves between attacks, although many affected people may have increasing bouts of muscle weakness as the disorder progresses (abortive attacks). Sometimes with HyperKPP those affected may experience degrees of muscle stiffness and spasms (myotonia) in the affected muscles. This can be caused by the same things that trigger the paralysis, dependent on the type of myotonia.\nSome people with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis have increased levels of potassium in their blood (hyperkalemia) during attacks. In other cases, attacks are associated with normal blood potassium levels (normokalemia). Ingesting potassium can trigger attacks in affected individuals, even if blood potassium levels do not rise in response.\nIn contrast to HyperKPP, hypokalemic periodic paralysis (noted in humans) refers to loss-of-function mutations in channels that prevent muscle depolarisation and therefore are aggravated by low potassium ion concentrations.",

Initial laboratory findings include a decrease in serum fibrinogen mass levels as measured by immunoassay plus a reduction in inducible blood clot formation so that the ratio of functionally-detected fibrinogen mass (i.e. detected in induced clots) to immunoassay-detected fibrinogen mass is abnormally low, i.e. <0.7. This contrast with individuals with congenital dysfibrinogenemia who exhibit normal levels of fibrinogen as measured by immunoassay but low functionally-detected to immunoassay-detected fibrinogen mass ratios, i.e. <0.7. Where available, specialized laboratories can conduct studies to define the exact gene mutation(s) and fibrinogen abnormalities underlying the disorder.[1][2][6]",
    "Treatment": "Blood relatives of the proband case should be evaluated for the presence of hypodysfibrinogenemia. Individuals with the disorder need to be advised on its inheritance, complications, and preventative measures that can be taken to avoid bleeding and/or thrombosis. Since >80% of individuals may develop bleeding or thrombosis complications of the disorder, asymptomatic individuals diagnosed with hydposyfibrinogenemia are best handled at a specialized center in order to benefit from multidisciplinary management.[2]\nMeasures to prevent and/or treat complications of hypodysfibrinogenemia should be tailored to the personal and family history of the individual by a specialized center. Individuals with a personal or family history of bleeding are considered to be of low risk of bleeding when their functional fibrinogen levels are >1 gram/liter for major surgery, >0.5 gram/liter for minor surgery, >0.5 to 1-2 gram/liter for spontaneous bleeding (depending on its severity), >0.5 to > 1 gram/liter for the first two trimesters of pregnancy, and >1 to <2 gram/liter for the last trimester of pregnancy and postpartum period. Functional fibrinogen below these levels should be treated preferably with fibrinogen concentrate or if not available, fibrinogen-rich cryoprecipitate or plasma to attain low risk levels of functional fibrinogen.[2] Antifibrinolytic drugs such as tranexamic acid or (ε-aminocaproic acid) may be considered as an alternative preventative or therapeutic treatments in cases of minor surgery, dental extractions, mucosal bleeding, or other episodes of mild bleeding.[2][4] In individuals with a personal or family history of thrombosis, should be considered for long-term anticoagulation drugs such as low molecular weight heparin, coumadin, or rivaroxaban.[2]",

    "Signs and symptoms": "Hypokalemic periodic paralysis is a condition that causes episodes of extreme muscle weakness typically beginning in childhood or adolescence. Most often, these episodes involve a temporary inability to move muscles in the arms and legs. Attacks cause severe weakness or paralysis that usually lasts from hours to days. Some people may have episodes almost every day, while others experience them weekly, monthly, or only rarely. Attacks can occur without warning or can be triggered by factors such as rest after exercise, a viral illness, or certain medications. Often, a large, carbohydrate-rich meal or vigorous exercise in the evening can trigger an attack upon waking the following morning. Although affected individuals usually regain their muscle strength between attacks, some develop persistent muscle weakness later in life.[3]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis can be achieved through a specialized form of electromyographic (EMG) testing called the long exercise test. This test measures the amplitude of a nerve response (called the Compound Muscle Action Potential or CMAP) for 40 to 50 minutes following a few minutes of exercise. In affected patients, there is a progressive fall in the amplitude of the potential. Besides the patient history or a report of serum potassium low normal or low during an attack, the long exercise test is the current standard for medical testing. Genetic diagnosis is often unreliable as only a few of the more common gene locations are tested, but even with more extensive testing 20–37% of people with a clinical diagnosis of hypokalemic periodic paralysis have no known mutation in the two known genes.[9] Standard EMG testing cannot diagnose a patient unless they are in a full blown attack at the time of testing. Provoking an attack with exercise and diet then trying oral potassium can be diagnostic, but also dangerous as this form of PP has an alternate form known as hyperkalemic periodic paralysis. The symptoms are almost the same, but the treatment is different. The old glucose insulin challenge is dangerous and risky to the point of being life-threatening and should never be done when other options are so readily available.[citation needed] Factors known to trigger episodes are: stress, cold environment or hypothermia, carbohydrate load, infection, glucose infusion, metabolic alkalosis, alcohol, strenuous exercise, and steroids.[citation needed]\nPeople with hypokalemic periodic paralysis are often misdiagnosed as having a conversion disorder or hysterical paralysis since the weakness is muscle-based and doesn't correspond to nerve or spinal root distributions. The tendency of people with hypokalemic periodic paralysis to get paralyzed when epinephrine is released in \"fight or flight\" situations further adds to the temptation to misdiagnose the disorder as psychiatric.[10]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment of hypokalemic periodic paralysis focuses on preventing further attacks and relieving acute symptoms. Avoiding carbohydrate-rich meals, strenuous exercise and other identified triggers, and taking acetazolamide or another carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, may help prevent attacks of weakness. Some patients also take potassium-sparing diuretics such as spironolactone to help maintain potassium levels.[11]\nParalysis attacks can be managed by drinking one of various potassium salts dissolved in water (debate exists over which, if any one in particular, is best used, but potassium chloride and bicarbonate are common). Rapidly absorbed boluses of liquid potassium are generally needed to abort an attack, but some patients also find positive maintenance results with time-released potassium tablets. IV potassium is seldom justified unless the patient is unable to swallow. Daily potassium dosage may need to be much higher than for potassium replacement from simple hypokalemia: 100-150 mEqs of potassium is often needed to manage daily fluctuations in muscle strength and function.[citation needed]\nPerioperatively, prevention includes avoiding neuromuscular blockade, avoid excessive hyperventilation, warm the patient, provide adequate hydration, avoid glucose infusions, do not give diuretics, and closely monitor the electrocardiogram for signs of hypokalemia. Normal saline is the preferred IV solution for patients with familial hypokalemic periodic paralysis. Glucose containing solutions may cause weakness. Additionally, the high chloride content can cause a mild acidosis which would be preferred over alkalosis.[citation needed]",

    "Disease": "Hypoparathyroidism",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The main symptoms of hypoparathyroidism are the result of the low blood calcium level, which interferes with normal muscle contraction and nerve conduction. As a result, people with hypoparathyroidism can experience paresthesia, an unpleasant tingling sensation around the mouth and in the hands and feet, as well as muscle cramps and severe spasms known as \"tetany\" that affect the hands and feet.[3] Many also report a number of subjective symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, bone pain and insomnia.[1] Crampy abdominal pain may occur.[4] Physical examination of someone with hypocalcemia may show tetany, but it is also possible to provoke tetany of the facial muscles by tapping on the facial nerve (a phenomenon known as Chvostek's sign) or by using the cuff of a sphygmomanometer to temporarily obstruct the blood flow to the arm (a phenomenon known as Trousseau's sign of latent tetany).[4]\nSeveral medical emergencies can arise in people with low calcium levels. These are seizures, severe irregularities in the normal heart beat (specifically prolongation of the QT interval), as well as spasm of the upper part of the airways or the smaller airways known as the bronchi (both potentially causing respiratory failure).[1][5]",
    "Cause": "Hypoparathyroidism can have the following causes:[1]\n• Removal of, or trauma to, the parathyroid glands due to anterior neck surgery (including thyroid surgery) (thyroidectomy), parathyroid surgery (parathyroidectomy). This is the most common cause of hypoparathyroidism, with 78% of cases of hypoparathyroidism arising due to a complication of anterior neck surgery.[5] Although surgeons generally make attempts to spare normal parathyroid glands at surgery, inadvertent injury to the glands or their blood supply is still common. When this happens, the parathyroids may cease functioning. This is usually temporary, but occasionally long-term (permanent). Hypoparathyroidism may occur as a complication in up to 8% of anterior neck surgeries, with 75% of those resolving by 6 months, and 25% of those having permanent hypoparathyroidism.[5]\n• Kenny–Caffey syndrome\n• Autoimmune invasion and destruction is the most common non-surgical cause. It can occur as part of autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes.\n• Hemochromatosis can lead to iron accumulation and consequent dysfunction of several endocrine organs, including the parathyroids.\n• Absence or dysfunction of the parathyroid glands is one of the components of chromosome 22q11 microdeletion syndrome (other names: DiGeorge syndrome, Shprintzen syndrome, velocardiofacial syndrome).\n• Magnesium deficiency\n• A defect in the calcium receptor leads to a rare congenital form of the disease\n• Idiopathic (of unknown cause)\n• Occasionally, due to other hereditary causes (e.g., Barakat syndrome (HDR syndrome), a genetic development disorder resulting in hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural deafness, and kidney disease)",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is by measurement of calcium, serum albumin (for correction), and PTH in blood. If necessary, measuring cAMP (cyclic AMP) in the urine after an intravenous dose of PTH can help in the distinction between hypoparathyroidism and other causes.[citation needed]\nDifferential diagnoses are:\n• Pseudohypoparathyroidism (normal PTH levels but tissue insensitivity to the hormone, associated with intellectual disability and skeletal deformities) and pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism.[7]\n• Vitamin D deficiency or hereditary insensitivity to this vitamin (X-linked dominant).\n• Malabsorption\n• Kidney disease\n• Medication: steroids, diuretics, some antiepileptics.\nOther tests include ECG for abnormal heart rhythms, and measurement of blood magnesium levels.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Severe hypocalcaemia, a potentially life-threatening condition,  is treated as soon as possible with intravenous calcium (e.g., as calcium gluconate). Calcium gluconate can be given via a peripheral IV; however, other calcium formulations require infusion via a central venous catheter as the calcium can irritate peripheral veins and cause phlebitis.[5] Precautions are taken to prevent seizures or larynx spasms. The heart is monitored for abnormal rhythms during IV treatment, as calcium may affect cardiac conduction.[5] When the life-threatening attack has been controlled, the person is then transitioned to long-term therapy with oral or subcutaneous injection medications.[5]\nLong-term treatment of hypoparathyroidism is with vitamin D analogs (such as calcitriol or alfacalcidol), vitamin D supplementation and calcium supplementation.[5] Potential risks of treatment for hypoparathyroidism include hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria (elevated calcium in the urine) which may lead to kidney calcification (nephrocalcinosis) and chronic kidney disease.[5][8] Calcium levels in the blood and urine (along with other electrolytes) must be monitored during long-term treatment of hypoparathyroidism and blood calcium levels are intentionally kept at the lower limits of normal, or mildly low, specifically to avoid hypercalciuria, kidney calcification and kidney damage.[5]\nRecombinant human parathyroid hormone and teriparatide (which consists of the first N-terminal 34 amino acids of parathyroid hormone, the bioactive portion of the hormone)(PTH 1-34) may be used as a second line therapy in those that have not responded to conventional therapy.[5] Both medications may be given via subcutaneous injections, but the use of pump delivery of synthetic PTH 1-34 provides the closest approach to physiologic PTH replacement therapy.[9] Recombinant human parathyroid hormone and teriparatide are also associated with a risk of hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria with associated kidney calcification and kidney damage.[5] If these medications are discontinued, they should be tapered, and calcium levels should be closely monitored, as the transient PTH depletion after stopping the medications can lead to bone leaching of calcium as a compensatory mechanism to increase calcium levels.[5]\nA 2019 systematic review has highlighted that, because of the research gap in recent rigorous studies, there is a lack of high-quality evidence for the use of vitamin D, calcium, or recombinant parathyroid hormone in the management of both temporary and long-term hypoparathyroidism following thyroidectomy.[10]\nKidney ultrasound may be considered periodically to assess for any nephrocalcinosis for those on long-term therapy for hypoparathyroidism.[5]",

    "Signs and symptoms": "There is a remarkable variety of symptoms that depends, largely, on the age of the patient at initial presentation, ranging from death in utero to relatively mild bone problems with or without dentition symptoms[10] in adult life although neurological and extra-skeletal symptoms are also reported.[11] The stages of this disease are generally included in the following categories: perinatal, infantile, childhood, adult, benign prenatal and odontohypophosphatasia.[12] Although several clinical sub-types of the disease have been characterized, based on the age at which skeletal lesions are discovered, the disease is best understood as a single continuous spectrum of severity.[citation needed]\nAs the presentation of adult disease is highly variable, incorrect or missed diagnosis may occur.[10] In one study, 19% of patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia had laboratory findings suggestive of possible hypophosphatasia.[13]\nOne case report details a 35-year old female with low serum ALP and mild pains but no history of rickets, fractures or dental problems. Subsequent evaluation showed osteopenia and renal microcalcifications and an elevation of PEA. The genetic mutations found in this case were previously reported in perinatal, infantile and childhood hypophosphatasia, but not adult hypophosphatasia.[10]",
    "Cause": "Hypophosphatasia is associated with a molecular defect in the gene encoding tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP). TNSALP is an enzyme that is tethered to the outer surface of osteoblasts and chondrocytes. TNSALP hydrolyzes several substances, including mineralization-inhibiting inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) and pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP), a major form of vitamin B.  A relationship describing physiologic regulation of mineralization has been termed the Stenciling Principle of mineralization, whereby enzyme-substrate pairs imprint mineralization patterns locally into the extracellular matrix (most notably described for bone) by degrading mineralization inhibitors (e.g. TNAP/TNSALP/ALPL enzyme degrading the pyrophosphate inhibition of mineralization, and PHEX enzyme degrading the osteopontin inhibition of mineralization).[24][25] The Stenciling Principle for mineralization is particularly relevant to the osteomalacia and odontomalacia observed in hypophosphatasia (HPP) and X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH).[25]6.\nWhen TSNALP enzymatic activity is low, inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) accumulates outside of cells in the extracellular matrix of bones and teeth, and inhibits formation of hydroxyapatite mineral, the main hardening component of bone, causing rickets in infants and children and osteomalacia (soft bones) and odontomalacia (soft teeth) in children and adults. PLP is the principal form of vitamin B6 and must be dephosphorylated by TNSALP before it can cross the cell membrane. Vitamin B6 deficiency in the brain impairs synthesis of neurotransmitters, which can cause seizures. In some cases, a build-up of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals in the joint can cause pseudogout.[26]",
    "Diagnosis": "N/A",
    "Treatment": "As of October 2015, asfotase alfa (Strensiq) has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of hypophosphatasia.\nSome evidence exists to support the use of teriparatide in adult-HPP.[38][39][40][41]\nCurrent management consists of palliating symptoms, maintaining calcium balance and applying physical, occupational, dental and orthopedic interventions, as necessary.[8]\n• Hypercalcemia in infants may require restriction of dietary calcium or administration of calciuretics. This should be done carefully so as not to increase the skeletal demineralization that results from the disease itself.[42] Vitamin D sterols and mineral supplements, traditionally used for rickets or osteomalacia, should not be used unless there is a deficiency, as blood levels of calcium ions (Ca2+), inorganic phosphate (Pi) and vitamin D metabolites usually are not reduced.[43]\n• Craniosynostosis, the premature closure of skull sutures, may cause intracranial hypertension and may require neurosurgical intervention to avoid brain damage in infants.[44]\n• Bony deformities and fractures are complicated by the lack of mineralization and impaired skeletal growth in these patients. Fractures and corrective osteotomies (bone cutting) can heal, but healing may be delayed and require prolonged casting or stabilization with orthopedic hardware. A load-sharing intramedullary nail or rod is the best surgical treatment for complete fractures, symptomatic pseudofractures, and progressive asymptomatic pseudofractures in adult hypophosphatasia patients.[45]\n• Dental problems: Children particularly benefit from skilled dental care, as early tooth loss can cause malnutrition and inhibit speech development. Dentures may ultimately be needed. Dentists should carefully monitor patients' dental hygiene and use prophylactic programs to avoid deteriorating health and periodontal disease.[29]\n• Physical Impairments and pain: Rickets and bone weakness associated with hypophosphatasia can restrict or eliminate ambulation, impair functional endurance, and diminish ability to perform activities of daily living. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may improve pain-associated physical impairment and can help improve walking distance[46]]\n• Bisphosphonate (a pyrophosphate synthetic analog) in one infant had no discernible effect on the skeleton, and the infant's disease progressed until death at 14 months of age.[47]\n• Bone marrow cell transplantation in two severely affected infants produced radiographic and clinical improvement, although the mechanism of efficacy is not fully understood and significant morbidity persisted.[48][49]\n• Enzyme replacement therapy with normal, or ALP-rich serum from patients with Paget's bone disease, was not beneficial.[50][51]\n• Phase 2 clinical trials of bone targeted enzyme-replacement therapy for the treatment of hypophosphatasia in infants and juveniles have been completed, and a phase 2 study in adults is ongoing.[52][53]\n• Pyridoxine, or Vitamin B6 may be used as adjunctive therapy in some cases, which may be referred to as Pyridoxine responsive seizures.[15][54]",

    "Disease": "Hypopituitarism",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The hormones of the pituitary have different actions in the body, and the symptoms of hypopituitarism therefore depend on which hormone is deficient. The symptoms may be subtle and are often initially attributed to other causes.[1][6] In most of the cases, three or more hormones are deficient.[7] The most common problem is insufficiency of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and/or luteinizing hormone (LH) leading to sex hormone abnormalities. Growth hormone deficiency is more common in people with an underlying tumor than those with other causes.[1][7]\nSometimes, there are additional symptoms that arise from the underlying cause; for instance, if the hypopituitarism is due to a growth hormone-producing tumor, there may be symptoms of acromegaly (enlargement of the hands and feet, coarse facial features), and if the tumor extends to the optic nerve or optic chiasm, there may be visual field defects. Headaches may also accompany pituitary tumors,[1] as well as pituitary apoplexy (infarction or haemorrhage of a pituitary tumor) and lymphocytic hypophysitis (autoimmune inflammation of the pituitary).[8] Apoplexy, in addition to sudden headaches and rapidly worsening visual loss, may also be associated with double vision that results from compression of the nerves in the adjacent cavernous sinus that control the eye muscles.[9]\nPituitary failure results in many changes in the skin, hair and nails as a result of the absence of pituitary hormone action on these sites.[10]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of hypopituitarism is made on blood tests. Two types of blood tests are used to confirm the presence of a hormone deficiency: basal levels, where blood samples are taken–usually in the morning–without any form of stimulation, and dynamic tests, where blood tests are taken after the injection of a stimulating substance. Measurement of ACTH and growth hormone usually requires dynamic testing, whereas the other hormones (LH/FSH, prolactin, TSH) can typically be tested with basal levels. There is no adequate direct test for ADH levels, but ADH deficiency can be confirmed indirectly; oxytocin levels are not routinely measured.[1]\nGenerally, the finding of a combination of a low pituitary hormone together with a low hormone from the effector gland is indicative of hypopituitarism.[14] Occasionally, the pituitary hormone may be normal but the effector gland hormone decreased; in this case, the pituitary is not responding appropriately to effector hormone changes, and the combination of findings is still suggestive of hypopituitarism.[6]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment of hypopituitarism is threefold: removing the underlying cause, treating the hormone deficiencies, and addressing any other repercussions that arise from the hormone deficiencies.[1]",

    "Disease": "Hypoplastic left heart syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Closing of the ductus arteriosus in a heart that is severely underdeveloped on the left results in cyanosis and respiratory distress which can progress to cardiogenic shock and death. Early symptoms might include poor feeding or cyanosis that does not respond to oxygen administration. Peripheral pulses may be weak and extremities cool to the touch.[5]\nHLHS often co-occurs with low birth weight and premature birth.[5]\nIn neonates with a small atrial septal defect, termed \"restrictive\", there is inadequate mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. These neonates quickly decompensate and develop acidosis and cyanosis.[5]\nOn EKG, right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy are common, but not indicative of HLHS. Chest x-ray may show a large heart (cardiomegaly) or increased pulmonary vasculature. Neonates with HLHS do not typically have a heart murmur, but in some cases, a pulmonary flow murmur or tricuspid regurgitation murmur may be audible.[5]\nCo-occurring tricuspid regurgitation or right ventricular dysfunction can cause hepatomegaly to develop.[5]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "Hypoplastic left heart syndrome can be diagnosed prenatally or after birth via echocardiography. Typical findings include a small left ventricle and aorta, abnormalities of the mitral and aortic valves, retrograde flow in the transverse arch of the aorta, and left-to-right flow between the atria. It is often recognized during the second trimester of pregnancy, between 18 and 24 weeks' gestation.[5]\nChest x-ray may also be utilized in the diagnosis of hypoplastic left heart syndrome, and typically shows an enlarged cardiac silhouette along with signs pulmonary hypertension. Blood work and genetic testing remain of high importance as well, and should include a complete blood count, electrolytes, lactate, and arterial blood gas to evaluate acid-base status and oxygenation. Genetic testing may be beneficial to obtain and has been associated with multiple chromosomal abnormalities including Turner, DiGeorge, and Down syndrome.[21]",

    "Disease": "Hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Hair growth on the head is noticeably less full than normal, and the hairs are very weak; the rest of the body shows normal hair. The macular degeneration comes on slowly with deterioration of central vision, leading to a loss of reading ability. Those affected may otherwise develop in a completely healthy manner; life expectancy is normal.[citation needed]",
    "Cause": "Hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy is an autosomal recessive hereditary disease.[2] It is caused by a combination of mutations (compound heterozygosity) in the CDH3 gene, which codes for Cadherin-3 (also known as P-Cadherin), a calcium-binding protein that is responsible for cellular adhesion in various tissues.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "The markedly anomalous hair growth should lead to a retinal examination by school entry at the latest, since weak vision will not necessarily be detected in the course of normal medical check-ups. Confirmation of a diagnosis, which is necessary for any future therapeutic options, is only possible by means of a molecular genetic diagnosis in the context of genetic counseling.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "There is no treatment for the disorder. A number of studies are looking at gene therapy, exon skipping and CRISPR interference to offer hope for the future. Accurate determination through confirmed diagnosis of the genetic mutation that has occurred also offers potential approaches beyond gene replacement for a specific group, namely in the case of diagnosis of a so-called nonsense mutation, a mutation where a stop codon is produced by the changing of a single base in the DNA sequence. This results in premature termination of protein biosynthesis, resulting in a shortened and either functionless or function-impaired protein. In what is sometimes called \"read-through therapy\", translational skipping of the stop codon, resulting in a functional protein, can be induced by the introduction of specific substances. However, this approach is only conceivable in the case of narrowly circumscribed mutations, which cause differing diseases.[citation needed]",

    "Disease": "I-cell disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Mucolipidosis II (ML II) is a particularly severe form of ML that has a significant resemblance to another mucopolysaccharidosis called Hurler syndrome. Generally, only laboratory testing can distinguish the two as the presentation is so similar, with high plasma concentrations of lysosomal enzymes, often fatal in childhood.[4] Typically, by the age of six months, failure to thrive and developmental delays are obvious signs of this disorder. Some physical signs, such as abnormal skeletal development, coarse facial features (e.g. bulging scaphocephalic head, flat nose), and restricted joint movement, may be present at birth. Children with ML II usually have enlargement of certain organs, such as the liver (hepatomegaly) or spleen (splenomegaly), and sometimes even the heart valves. Affected children often have stiff claw-shaped hands and fail to grow and develop in the first months of life. Delays in the development of their motor skills are usually more pronounced than delays in their cognitive (mental processing) skills. Children with ML II eventually develop a clouding on the cornea of their eyes and, because of their lack of growth, develop short-trunk dwarfism (underdeveloped trunk). These young patients are often plagued by recurrent respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia, otitis media (middle ear infections), bronchitis and carpal tunnel syndrome. Children with ML II generally die before their seventh year of life, often as a result of congestive heart failure or recurrent respiratory tract infections.[citation needed]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnostic measures can include the following:\nBefore birth:\n• Abnormally low concentrations of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase enzyme activity in amniotic fluid cells or chorionic villi[8]\nIn infants:\n• Elevated plasma lysosomal enzyme concentrations[8]\n• Decreased concentration of lysosomal enzymes in cultured fibroblasts and increased in the surrounding medium[8]\n• Presence of inclusion bodies in peripheral blood lymphocytes[8]\n• Low concentrations of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase enzyme activity as measured in white blood cells[8]",
    "Treatment": "There is no cure  for I-cell disease/Mucolipidosis II disease; treatment is limited to controlling or reducing symptoms. Nutritional supplements, particularly iron and vitamin B12, are often recommended. Physical therapy to improve motor delays and speech therapy to improve language acquisition are treatment options. Surgery can remove the thin layer of corneal clouding to temporarily improve the complication. It is possible that bone marrow transplant may be helpful in delaying or correcting the neurological deterioration that occurs with I-Cell disease.[9] The Yash Gandhi Foundation is a US non-profit organization which funds research for I-Cell disease.[10]",

In some cases, a skin biopsy is done to help to confirm the diagnosis while in others genetic testing may be helpful in making a diagnosis. Diabetes has not been definitively linked to acquired ichthyosis or ichthyosis vulgaris; however, there are case reports associating new onset ichthyosis with diabetes.[6]\nIchthyosis has been found to be more common in Native American, Asian, Mongolian groups.[citation needed] There is no way to prevent ichthyosis.\nIchthyosis is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disease that can be isolated and restricted to the skin manifestations or associated with extracutaneous symptoms, one of which is limb reduction defect known as CHILD syndrome, a rare inborn error of metabolism of cholesterol biosynthesis that is usually restricted to one side of the body. One case with symptoms matching CHILD syndrome has been described as having a likely-different cause.[7]",
    "Treatment": "Treatments for ichthyosis often take the form of topical application of creams and emollient oils, in an attempt to hydrate the skin. Creams containing a high percentage of urea or lactic acid have been shown to work exceptionally well in some cases.[8] Application of propylene glycol is another treatment method. Retinoids are used for some conditions.\nExposure to sunlight may improve[citation needed] or worsen the condition. In some cases, excess dead skin sloughs off much better from wet tanned skin after bathing or a swim, although the dry skin might be preferable to the damaging effects of sun exposure.\nThere can be ocular manifestations of ichthyosis, such as corneal and ocular surface diseases.

    "Disease": "Ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens has symptoms very similar to epidermolytic hyperkeratosis but is generally milder. Ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens affects only the upper layers of the epidermis whilst epidermolytic hyperkeratosis affects the suprabasal layer which is deeper in the skin.[3]\nAt birth the baby's skin has a red appearance like a sun burn (erythema). Blistering is usually present at birth and may be extensive or localized depending on the severity of the disease.[4]\nOver the first few weeks the redness disappears and is replaced by dry, flaking skin on the arms, legs and around the belly button.[5] Other areas of skin appear normal. The skin is fragile and is prone to blistering (caused by mild trauma or sweating).[5] After a few months hyperkeratosis develops with a dark grey or brown, ridged appearance on the ankles, knees and elbows.[4] Palms and soles are generally unaffected.[3] A slightly unpleasant, sweet odour may be present.[2]\nA distinctive characteristic of ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens that is not present in other forms of ichthyosis is called the \"Mauserung phenomenon\" (Mauserung is German for \"moulting\" and was first described by H.W.Siemens). These are small patches of bare, apparently normal skin in the middle of areas of hyperkeratosis.[3][6]\nAs the affected person ages the flaking and blistering should improve. The hyperkeratosis may grow more severe but more localized and is generally only present on flexural folds of the major joints.[4]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "Mild forms of ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens should be diagnosable from appearance and patient history alone.

It may be difficult to distinguish from epidermolytic hyperkeratosis.\nThe gene causing ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens is known and so a diagnosis can be confirmed by genetic testing.[4]",
    "Treatment": "Treatments for ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens generally attempt to improve the appearance of the skin and the comfort of the patient. This is done by exfoliating and increasing the moisture of the skin. Common treatments include:\n• Emollients: moisturisers, petroleum jelly or other emollients are used, often several times a day, to increase the moisture of the skin.\n• Baths: long baths (possibly including salt) several times a week are used to soften the skin and allow exfoliation.\n• Exfoliating creams: creams containing keratolytics such as urea, salicylic acid and lactic acid may be useful.\n• Antiseptic washes: antiseptics may be used to kill bacteria in the skin and prevent odour.\n• Retinoids: very severe cases may use oral retinoids to control symptoms but these have many serious side effects including, an increase in blistering.[11]",

History of the age of the onset, and using family pedigree to clarify the pattern of inheritance can help to specify ichthyosis vulgaris among other types of ichthyoses. In some cases, it might be hard to clearly differentiate between ichthyosis vulgaris and other ichthyoses; a doctor can go request genetic testing or take a biopsy and make a histopathology examination, but even this test is still suggestive and not specific for ichthyosis vulgaris.[3]",
    "Treatment": "Hereditary ichthyosis vulgaris is a persistent condition that tends to improve with age but typically demands ongoing management. The seriousness of acquired ichthyosis, on the other hand, is generally linked to the underlying systemic condition. The primary approach for both forms involves maintaining skin hydration and applying ointments to prevent moisture loss. Hydration encourages skin shedding by enhancing the activity of certain enzymes and making the skin more responsive to mechanical forces. It also enhances the suppleness of the outermost skin layer.[16]\nFor some patients, topical retinoids can be beneficial, while alpha-hydroxy acids such as lactic, glycolic, or pyruvic acids prove effective in moisturising the skin. They operate by breaking down skin cells in the lower layers of the newly formed outer skin layer. For example, lactic acid is available in a 12% ammonium lactate lotion or can be specially compounded at concentrations of 5–10% in a suitable base. Twice-daily applications have proven more effective than petroleum-based creams in managing ichthyosis vulgaris.\nTo help remove scales, keratolytics like salicylic acid can be useful as they induce the breakdown of skin cells in the upper skin layer. There is a commercially available 6% salicylic acid gel suitable for use on limited areas.\nMany over-the-counter products contain either urea or propylene glycol. Moisturisers with lower-strength urea (10–20%) enhance the flexibility of the outer skin layer by acting as humectants. Propylene glycol, on the other hand, draws water through the outer skin layer, facilitating the shedding of thickened skin post-hydration. It is a common component in both prescription and over-the-counter products. A new emulsion containing urea (10%), ceramides, and natural moisturising factors, applied twice daily, can be beneficial for individuals with hyperkeratotic and dry skin.[17]\nTopical retinoids, like tretinoin, might also provide benefits, as they reduce the cohesion of skin cells, promote cell turnover, and inhibit the production of keratin. In some small trials, tazarotene, a selective topical retinoid, has demonstrated effectiveness. While steroids are generally ineffective for ichthyosis vulgaris, a mild topical steroid could be employed to relieve itching. In cases of acquired ichthyosis vulgaris, treatment primarily involves addressing the underlying systemic condition, often leading to symptom improvement. Ongoing research aims to assess and compare the physical and chemical properties of various topical emollients to determine their efficacy in managing ichthyosis vulgaris.[18]",

Additionally, bleeding from the nostrils and/or gums, as well as menorrhagia (excessive menstrual bleeding), may occur if the platelet count falls below 20,000 per μL.[4] A platelet count below 10,000 per μL can lead to the spontaneous formation of hematomas (blood masses) in the mouth or on other mucous membranes. Furthermore, bleeding time from minor lacerations or abrasions is usually prolonged.[citation needed]\nIn cases where platelet counts drop to extremely low levels (<5,000 per μL), serious and potentially fatal complications may arise. These complications include subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhage (bleeding inside the skull or brain), lower gastrointestinal bleeding, or other internal bleeding. A person with ITP with an extremely low platelet count is susceptible to internal bleeding resulting from blunt abdominal trauma, such as in a motor vehicle crash. These complications are more likely to occur when the platelet count is less than 20,000 per μL.[5]\n• Petechiae on the lower extremities\n• Oral petechiae/purpura — lower lip\n• Petechia on the tongue in a person with platelets of 3 due to ITP\n• Petechia of the lower leg in a person with platelets of 3 due to ITP",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of ITP is a process of exclusion. First, it has to be determined that there are no blood abnormalities other than a low platelet count, and no physical signs other than bleeding. Then, secondary causes (around 5–10 percent of suspected ITP cases) should be excluded including medications (quinine or heparin), viral infection (HIV or HCV), malignancy (leukemia), autoimmune conditions (systemic lupus erythematosus or antiphospholipid syndrome), onyalai, and others.[4][12] All patients with presumed ITP should be tested for HIV and hepatitis C virus, as platelet counts may be corrected by treating the underlying disease. In approximately 2.7 to 5 percent of cases, autoimmune hemolytic anemia and ITP coexist, a condition referred to as Evans syndrome.[13][14]\nDespite the destruction of platelets by splenic macrophages, the spleen is normally not enlarged. In fact, an enlarged spleen should lead to a search for other possible causes for the thrombocytopenia. Bleeding time is usually prolonged in ITP patients. However, the use of bleeding time in diagnosis is discouraged by the American Society of Hematology practice guidelines[15] and a normal bleeding time does not exclude a platelet disorder.[16]\nBone marrow examination may be performed on patients over the age of 60 and those who do not respond to treatment, or when the diagnosis is in doubt.[12] On examination of the marrow, an increase in the production of megakaryocytes may be observed  and may help in establishing a diagnosis of ITP. An analysis for anti-platelet antibodies is a matter of clinician's preference, as there is disagreement on whether the 80 percent specificity of this test is sufficient to be clinically useful.[12]",
    "Treatment": "With rare exceptions, there is usually no need to treat based on platelet counts. Many older recommendations suggested a certain platelet count threshold (usually somewhere below 20.0/nL) as an indication for hospitalization or treatment. Current guidelines recommend treatment for adults with significant bleeding or counts below 30/nL, with very low certainty of evidence.[17]\nTreatment recommendations sometimes differ for adult and pediatric ITP.[18]",

Molecular genetic testing of the NEMO IKBKG gene (chromosomal locus Xq28) reveals disease-causing mutations in about 80% of probands. Such testing is available clinically. In addition, females with IP have skewed X-chromosome inactivation; testing for this can be used to support the diagnosis. Many people in the past were misdiagnosed with a second type of IP, formerly known as IP1. This has now been given its own name: Hypomelanosis of Ito (incontinentia pigmenti achromians). This has a slightly different presentation: swirls or streaks of hypopigmentation and depigmentation. It is not inherited and does not involve skin stages 1 or 2. Some 33–50% of patients have multisystem involvement—eye, skeletal, and neurological abnormalities. Its chromosomal locus is at Xp11, rather than Xq28.[citation needed]",

    "Disease": "Infantile digital fibromatosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "N/A",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of IDF is usually based on its presentation in newborn or young infants and biopsy or fine needle aspirate analyses of the tumors' pathology.[7] These analyses should show the presence of spindle-shaped cells bearing eosinophilic paranuclear inclusions consisting of actin and vimentin filaments, which, if necessary, can be confirmed by immunofluorescence staining of the filaments.[6] Inclusions may not be evident in older lesions stained with hematoxylin and eosin but may be apparent when stained with other reagents such as the Masson's trichrome stain,[6] phosphotungstic acid-haematoxylin stain, elastic Van Gieson's stain, or Lendrum's phloxine-tartrazine stain.[6] Demonstration of these filaments is not necessary for a diagnosis of IMF if the clinical picture and other histological findings are consistent with the disorder.[7] Findings of one or a few usually small lesions centered in the dermis of a digit consisting of spindle-shaped cells and expressing α-smooth muscle actin, desmin, and calponin proteins would support the diagnosis of IDF.[8]\nInfantile myofibromatosis (IMF) is, like IDF, a disease in which benign tumors develop primarily in the fingers and toes of newborns and infants and consists of spindle-shaped cells in a collagen fibrous background. IDF was once regarded as a sub-type of infantile myofibromatosis. However, IMF tumors can be far more aggressive than IDF lesions and consist of cells that do not have paranuclear inclusions.[2] The World Health Organization (2020) classification includes IPF but not IMF as a tumor in the category of benign fibroblastic and myofibroblastic tumors.[4]",
    "Treatment": "Infantile digital fibroma lesions were once thought to be potentially malignant and therefore treated with surgical excision and even digital amputations.[8] Currently, these tumors are known to be benign,[4] may spontaneously regress, and often recur after surgical removal.[8] Consequently, IDF lesions are usually treated by a watchful waiting observation approach with surgical resections limited to cases with functional impairment,[3] significant symptoms, or progressive, long-term growth.[7] Alternate or supplemental treatments used to treat IDF include injection of the glucocorticoid, triamcinolone, or the chemotherapy drug, 5-fluorouracil, directly into the lesions.[3] Since these injection treatments have not been evaluated in large studies to date, surgical resection is the most accepted treatment of highly symptomatic or progressively enlarging IDF lesions.[7] Overall, the prognosis for IDF is excellent.[3]",

However, the presence of two zone histopathology, family history of disease, and presence of the above cited PDGFRB gene mutations are almost always definitive indicators of IMF. IMF and the classic form of mesoblastic nephroma have been suggested to be the same disease because of their very similar histopathology. However, mesoblastic nephroma tumor cells, unlike IMF tumor cells, express cyclin D1 and Beta-catenin proteins and therefore likely have a very different cellular origin than IMF tumors.[22][23] Infantile digital fibromatosis, a tumor that develops primarily in the fingers and toes, had been regarded as a type of IMF. However its tumors have a distinctly different clinical presentation and histopathology than IMF.[24] The World Health Organization (2020) redefined infantile digital fibromatosis as a benign tumor in the category of benign fibroblastic and myofibroblastic tumors and therefore different than IMF.[25]",

Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder each carry one copy of the altered gene but do not show signs and symptoms of the disorder.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "In some cases, signs and symptoms of infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy first appear later in childhood or during the teenage years and progress more slowly.\nChildren with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy experience progressive difficulties with movement. Generally they have muscles that are at first weak and \"floppy\" (hypotonic), and then gradually become very stiff (spastic). Eventually, affected children lose the ability to move independently. Lack of muscle strength causes difficulty with feeding and breathing problems that can lead to frequent infections, such as pneumonia. Seizures occur in some affected children.[citation needed]\nRapid, involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus), and vision loss due to deterioration (atrophy) of the optic nerve are characteristic of infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy. Hearing loss may also develop. Children with this disorder experience progressive deterioration of cognitive functions (dementia), and eventually lose awareness of their surroundings.[citation needed]\nInfantile neuroaxonal dystrophy is characterized by the development of swellings called spheroid bodies in the axons, the fibers that extend from nerve cells (neurons) and transmit impulses to muscles and other neurons. A part of the brain called the cerebellum, which helps to control movements, may also be damaged. In some individuals with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy, abnormal amounts of iron accumulate in a specific region of the brain called the basal ganglia.[citation needed]",

    "Disease": "Iniencephaly",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The affected infant tends to be short, with a disproportionately large head. The fetal head of infants born with iniencephaly are hyperextended while the foramen magnum is enlarged and opens through the widened pedicles. The defective neural arches directly into the upper cervical reach of the spinal canal, causing the formation of a common cavity between most of the spinal cord and the brain. The skin of the anterior chest is connected directly to the face, bypassing the formation of a neck, while the scalp is directly connected to the skin of the back. Because of this, those born with this anomaly either have a highly shortened neck or no neck at all. This causes extreme retroflexion, or backward bending, of the head in a \"star-gazing\" fashion. The spine is severely distorted as well along with significant shortening due to marked lordosis. The vertebrae, especially cervical, are fused together in abnormal shapes and their numbers are reduced. The spinal cord is almost always defective while the ventricular system is often dilated and the cortex is thinned. Sometimes, in the case of iniencephaly apertus, an encephalocele (sac-like protrusions of the brain through an opening in the cranium) forms.[4][5][6]",
    "Cause": "Though the iniencephaly is not genetic with its cause unknown, studies have shown that there are certain factors that can increase the risk of mothers giving birth to children with these anomalies.",
    "Diagnosis": "The most accurate method of diagnosis is prenatal screening through real-time fetal images. However, since maternal body habitus leads to diagnostic difficulties using this method, MRI and sonography are the most commonly used technique since there is no exposure to ionizing radiation.[4] At the beginning of the second trimester, the central nervous system (CNS) and anatomic structures of the fetus can be clearly visualized and the characteristic malformations of iniencephaly, such as a shortened trunk, marked lordosis in the cervicothoracic vertebrae, absence or partial absence of the occipital squama, abnormal fusion of vertebrae, closed vertebral arches, formation of an encephalocele (for iniencephaly apertus), and dorsiflexion of the head in respect to the spine, can be precisely diagnosed as well as the severity and location established. Once established, further decisions can be made with regard to terminating the pregnancy or providing a plan of adequate postnatal care.[7]",

    "Signs and symptoms": "The most prominent symptom of intestinal atresia is bilious vomiting soon after birth.[1] This is most common in jejunal atresia.[2] Other features include abdominal distension and failure to pass meconium. The distension is more generalised the further down the bowel the atresia is located and is thus most prominent with ileal atresia.[1][2] Inability to pass stool is most common with duodenal or jejunal atresia;[2] if stool is passed, it may be small, mucus-like and grey.[1] Occasionally, there may be jaundice, which is most common in jejunal atresia.[2] Abdominal tenderness or an abdominal mass are not generally seen as symptoms of intestinal atresia. Rather, abdominal tenderness is a symptom of the late complication meconium peritonitis.[1]\nBefore birth, excess amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios) is a possible symptom. This is more common in duodenal and oesophageal atresia.[1]",
    "Cause": "The most common cause of non-duodenal intestinal atresia is a vascular accident in utero that leads to decreased intestinal perfusion and ischemia of the respective segment of bowel.[3] This leads to narrowing, or in the most severe cases, complete obliteration of the intestinal lumen.[citation needed]\nIn the case that the superior mesenteric artery, or another major intestinal artery, is occluded, large segments of bowel can be entirely underdeveloped (Type III). Classically, the affected area of bowel assumes a spiral configuration and is described to have an \"apple peel\" like appearance; this is accompanied by lack of a dorsal mesentery (Type IIIb). [citation needed]\nAn inherited form – familial multiple intestinal atresia – has also been described. This disorder was first reported in 1971.[4] It is due to a mutation in the gene TTC7A on short arm of chromosome 2 (2p16). It is inherited as an autosomal recessive gene and is usually fatal in infancy. Ileal atresia can also result as a complication of meconium ileus.[citation needed]\nA third of infants with intestinal atresia are born prematurely[1] or with low birth weight.[2]",
    "Diagnosis": "Intestinal atresias are often discovered before birth; either during a routine sonogram which shows a dilated intestinal segment  due to the blockage, or by the development of polyhydramnios (the buildup of too much amniotic fluid in the uterus). These abnormalities are indications that the fetus may have a bowel obstruction which a more detailed ultrasound study can confirm.[5] Infants with stenosis instead of atresia are often not discovered until several days after birth.[1]\nSome fetuses with bowel obstruction have abnormal chromosomes. An amniocentesis is recommended because it can determine not only the sex of the baby, but whether or not there is a problem with the chromosomes.[citation needed]\nIf not diagnosed in utero, infants with intestinal atresia are typically diagnosed at day 1 or day 2 after presenting with eating problems, vomiting, and/or failure to have a bowel movement.[3]  Diagnosis can be confirmed with an X-ray, and typically followed with an upper gastrointestinal series, lower gastrointestinal series, and ultrasound.[5][3]",
    "Treatment": "Fetal and neonatal intestinal atresia are treated using laparotomy after birth. If the area affected is small, the surgeon may be able to remove the damaged portion and join the intestine back together. In instances where the narrowing is longer, or the area is damaged and cannot be used for period of time, a temporary stoma may be placed.[citation needed]\nThe infant is usually given intravenous fluid hydration, and a nasogastric or orogastric tube may be used to aspirate the contents of the stomach. The nutritional administration is maintained after surgery until the bowel can resume normal function.[1]",

Other findings include hallux varus, brachymetatarsia affecting the fourth and fifth metatarsals, flat feet, and the presence of an elongated medial patellofemoral ligament.[20][21][22] Less common findings include micrognathia, cleft palate, frontal bossing and nose prominence.[23] Complications include infancy-onset recurrence of luxations, pain of the knee, impaired ability of running and riding bicycles, and late-onset gonarthrosis,[24] although it is not uncommon for some cases to be asymptomatic.",
    "Cause": "Ischiopatellar dysplasia is often considered a familial condition.[25][26][27][28] Ischiopatellar dysplasia has been identified on region 5.6 cM on chromosome 17q22. Mutations in the TBX4 (T-box protein 4) gene, in chromosome 17, have been found to cause ischiopatellar dysplasia due to the essential role TBX4 plays in lower limb development since TBX4 is a transcription factor.[29]",
    "Diagnosis": "Ischiopatellar dysplasia is usually identified through radiographic evidence since its characteristic changes are most notable in radiographic tests that indicate delayed bone age or absent ossification.[30] A full skeletal survey  should be performed on any patient that has an absent or hypoplastic patellae since they could potentially have ischiopatellar dysplasia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is especially helpful in the diagnosis of ischiopatellar syndrome and is recommended when an individual affected by ischiopatellar dysplasia has a traumatic injury to the knee.[31]\nAround 50-70 cases have been described in medical literature.[32] Diagnosis is made through genetic testing and radiography.[33]",

Upon seeking treatment in Germany, he had lost the epidermis from almost his entire body, with only his head and a patch on his left leg remaining. The group of Italian scientists had previously pioneered a technique to regenerate healthy skin in the laboratory. They used this treatment on the boy by taking a sample from his remaining healthy skin and then genetically modifying the skin cells, using a virus to deliver a healthy version of the LAMB3 gene into the nuclei. The patient underwent two operations in autumn 2015, where the new epidermis was attached. The graft had integrated into the lower layers of skin within a month, and the modified epidermal stem cells sustained this transgenic epidermis, curing the boy.[11] The introduction of genetic changes could increase the chances of skin cancer in other patients, but if the treatment is deemed safe in the long term, scientists believe the approach could be used to treat other skin disorders.[12]\nThe use of gentamicin has been shown to provide some attenuation of this disease.[13]",

    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis of SBMA is established by genetic testing that identifies a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the AR gene.[5] If more than 38 CAG repeats are identified, it is usually considered confirmatory of SBMA.[3] However, there is evidence for reduced penetrance with 36–37 CAG repeats.[26]",
    "Treatment": "N/A",
    "Management": "There is no known cure for SBMA.[7][8][9] Supportive care is focused on preventing disease complications (falls, fractures, aspiration) and maintaining independence.  Early interventions include occupational therapy to maintain mobility and activities of daily living.  Common mobility aids include canes, mobility scooters, power wheelchairs, ramps, and stair lifts.  As the disease progresses, swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) become more common and patients are at increased risk of aspiration pneumonia.  Swallowing interventions include dietary modifications (adjust food texture and consistency), postural techniques, and swallowing maneuvers. Respiratory therapy may be helpful to reduce respiratory tract infections and mobilize phlegm.[3]"

    "Disease": "Kienböck's disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "N/A",
    "Cause": "The cause of Kienböck's disease is unclear. Possible causes include trauma, particularly to the wrist; variations in the blood supply of the lunate bone; and differences in the length of the ulna (one of the bones in the forearm), known as ulnar variance. Negative ulnar variance means that the ulna is shorter than the radius, and is associated with an increased risk of Kienböck's disease. The bone loses its blood supply, leading to avascular necrosis. Recent imaging and histological studies have reinforced the importance of intraosseous vascularity, independent of factors like ulnar variance.[3]\nStudies have found a correlation between having Kienböck's and Western European ancestry, but no definitive link can be positively confirmed[citation needed].\nThe necrosis of the lunate bone can frequently be traced to a trauma to the wrist, like a compound fracture, which could cause the lunate's blood supply to be interrupted. Blood flows to the lunate through several arteries, each supplying a percentage. When one of these pathways is severed, the likelihood the patient will develop necrosis increases.[4]\nDespite a preponderance of evidence, no particular cause has been conclusively verified.[citation needed]\nData suggests[citation needed] that most people with Kienböck's are affected in their dominant hand, though about one-third report the condition in their non-dominant hand. In very few cases have there been people that have acquired it in both wrists.[citation needed]\nKienböck's disease is classified as a \"rare disorder,\" meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. population.[5]\nMany people with Kienböck's are frustrated by the lack of consensus among hand surgeons about optimal treatments for Kienböck's.[citation needed]  No matter what the disease's stage of progression, there is no one best treatment, and the decision is often based partially, or even mostly, on incidental factors such as the patient's pain tolerance, the patient's desire to return to active use of the hand (such as in manual occupations), and the surgeon's level of expertise with different treatments.[6]\nThough, since each case of Kienböck's is different, the makeup of the wrist and arm bones are important factors which are individualized to each patient. Therefore, one surgery will never be able to solve all the problems associated with the disease. Thus, no consensus can be reached among surgeons.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "N/A",
    "Treatment": "Operations that attempt to restore a blood supply to the lunate may be performed.[citation needed]\nDepending on the stage the disease is in when it is discovered, varying treatments are applied.[citation needed]\nIf X-rays show a mostly intact lunate (not having lost a great deal of size, and not having been compressed into a triangular shape), but an MRI shows a lack of blood flow to the bone, then revascularization is normally attempted. Revascularization techniques, usually involving a bone graft taken elsewhere from the body — often held in place by an external fixator for a period of weeks or months — have been successful at stages as late as 3B, although their use at later stages (like most treatments for Kienböck's) is controversial. One conservative treatment option would be using an Ultrasound Bone Stimulator, which uses low-intensity pulsed ultrasound to increase vascular endothelial growth factor (VEG-F) and increase blood flow to the bone.\nSome Kienböck's patients present with an abnormally large difference in length between the radius and the ulna, termed \"ulnar variance\", which is hypothesized to cause undue pressure on the lunate, contributing to its avascularity. In cases with such a difference, radial shortening is commonly performed. In this procedure, the radius (the lateral long bone) is shortened by a given length, usually between 2 and 5 mm, to relieve the pressure on the dying lunate. A titanium plate is inserted to hold the newly shortened bone together.[citation needed]\nDuring Stage 3, the lunate has begun to break apart due to the pressure of the surrounding bones. This causes sharp fragments of bone to float between the joints, causing excruciating pain. At this point, the lunate is ready for removal. The most frequently performed surgery is the Proximal Row Carpectomy, where the lunate, scaphoid and triquetrum are extracted. This greatly limits the range of motion of the wrist, but pain relief can be achieved for longer than after the other surgeries.\nAnother surgical option for this stage is a titanium, silicon or pyrocarbon implant that takes place of the lunate, though doctors shy from this due to a tendency of the implant to smooth the edges of the surrounding bones, thus causing painful pinched nerves when the bones slip out of place.\nAfter the lunate is removed, another procedure, ulnar shortening can be performed. This relieves pressure on the newly formed wrist joint of the pisiform, hamate and capitate. Depending on the surgeon, the procedure may be performed the same way as the radial shortening where a small section is removed, or the entire top of the ulna may be excised.\nAt Stage 4, the lunate has completely disintegrated and the other bones in the wrist have radiated downward to fill in the void. The hand now has a deformed appearance. The only procedure that can be done is the total wrist fusion, where a plate is inserted on the top of the wrist from the radius to the carpals, effectively freezing all flexion and movement in the wrist. Rotation is still possible as it is controlled by the radius and ulna.\nThis is currently the last and most complete surgical option for those with Kienböck's. Most of the treatments described here are not mutually exclusive — meaning that a single patient may receive many of them in his quest to relieve pain.  For instance, some patients have had casting, bone graft, radial shortening, proximal row carpectomy, and wrist fusion, all on the same hand. Recent studies suggest that vascularized bone grafting techniques, such as the use of pedicled or free vascularized grafts, may enhance revascularization of the lunate and improve functional outcomes, particularly in younger patients with early-stage disease.[8] Arthroscopic techniques have also gained popularity due to their minimally invasive nature and potential for quicker recovery.[9]\n• Left hand x-ray with Kienbock's Disease showing 4 mm negative ulnar variance and Kienbock's Disease Stage IIIB\n• Left hand x-ray with Kienbock's Disease\n• Left hand x-ray post proximal row carpectomy\n• X-ray showing stage IIIB on right wrist, with ulnar impingement.\n• X-ray on the right wrist showing arthrodesis.\n• X-Ray on Left Hand Post-Proximal Row Carpectomy, in Traction.\n• X-Ray on Left Hand Post-Proximal Row Carpectomy.",

Occasionally, the supraclavicular and axillary lymph nodes become swollen as well.[8] Rarely, enlargement of the liver and spleen and nervous system involvement resembling meningitis are seen. Often a bout of extreme fatigue can occur - often taking hold during latter parts of the day and the affected person can be more prone to fatigue from exercise.[citation needed]",

Other theories like persistent antigenic stimulation following arthropod bites and parasitic or candidal infection have also been proposed. To date, none of these theories has been substantiated.[1]",
    "Diagnosis": "An open biopsy is the chief means by which this disease is diagnosed.[citation needed]\n\"Lymphoid nodules with discrete germinal centers can occupy an area extending from the reticular dermis to the fascia and muscle. Follicular hyperplasia, marked eosinophilic infiltrate and eosinophilic abscesses, and the proliferation of postcapillary venules are characteristic histological findings. [18] Centrally, thick-walled vessels are present with hobnail endothelial cells. Immunohistochemical evaluation of the lymphoid nodules demonstrates a polymorphous infiltrate without clonality. [12, 27] Reports have also demonstrated the presence of plasmacytoid dendritic cells in a lesion of Kimura disease. [40] Histopathological examination is an effective way to establish the diagnosis.\"[7]",
    "Treatment": "Observation is acceptable if the lesions are neither symptomatic nor disfiguring. Intralesional or oral steroids can shrink the nodules, but seldom result in cure. Cyclosporine has been reported to induce remission in patients with Kimura's disease, but recurrence of the lesions has been observed once this therapy is stopped.[citation needed]\nCetirizine is an effective agent in treating its symptoms. Cetirizine's properties of being effective both in the treatment of pruritus (itching) and as an anti-inflammatory agent make it suitable for the treatment of the pruritus associated with these lesions.[8]  In a 2005 study, the American College of Rheumatology conducted treatments initially using prednisone, followed by steroid dosages and azathioprine,  omeprazole, and calcium and vitamin D supplements over the course of two years.[8] The skin condition of the patient began to improve and the skin lesions lessened. However, symptoms of cushingoid and hirsutism were observed before the patient was removed from the courses of steroids and placed on 10 mg/day of cetirizine to prevent skin lesions;[8] an agent suitable for the treatment of pruritus associated with such lesions.[8] Asymptomatically, the patient's skin lesions disappeared after treatment with cetirizine, blood eosinophil counts became normal,[8]  corticosteroid effects were resolved,[8] and a remission began within a period of two months.[8]  The inhibition of eosinophils may be the key to treatment of Kimura's disease due to the role of eosinophils, rather than other cells with regards to the lesions of the skin.[8]\nRadiotherapy has been used to treat recurrent or persistent lesions. However, considering the benign nature of this disease, radiation should be considered only in cases of recurrent, disfiguring lesions.[citation needed]\nSurgery has been considered the mainstay of therapy. However, recurrence after surgery is common.[9]\nIn 2011, an eight-year-old boy had presented with a firm, nontender, nonfluctuating 15- to 12-cm mass on the left side of the neck involving the lateral region of the neck and jaw and a 5- to 7-cm mass on the right side of his neck. He had an eosinophil concentration of 36% (absolute count: 8172/mL), his IgE level was 9187 IU/mL. He was diagnosed with Kimura's disease. Initially treated with corticosteroids, he was given a single dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as a steroid-sparing agent after the disease flared while tapering prednisone. After IVIG administration, improvement was rapid, both left and right cervical masses diminished to less than 1 cm and his eosinophil and IgE levels returned to normal range. He has been free of disease during a six-year follow-up. IVIG may have value in the treatment of Kimura's disease.[10]\nA study is going on to assess the efficacy of tacrolimus on Kimura's disease. One case has so far been described. A patient with refractory Kimura's disease after surgery and treatment with prednisone was treated with tacrolimus. Tacrolimus (FK-506) was administered at an initial dosage of 1 mg every 12 hours, and FK-506 concentration in the blood was monitored monthly. FK-506 blood concentration was controlled within 5 to 15 μg/L. After 6 months, the dosage of tacrolimus was reduced to 0.5 mg daily for another 2 months and then treatment was stopped. Swelling of the bilateral salivary glands disappeared within the first week. No serious side effects were noted and the disease has not recurred in the 2 years of follow-up. Tacrolimus may be an effective treatment for patients with Kimura's disease, but more research is needed to determine its long-term efficacy and safety, as well as its mechanism of action.[11]",

    "Disease": "Köhler disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Affected individuals experience pain and swelling in the middle part of the foot and usually limp as a result. Patients who walk with a limp tend to walk with increased weight on the lateral side of the foot. Also, there can be tenderness over the navicular. Patients often complain of pain over the apex.\nAn X-ray of both feet is used to diagnose disease. The affected foot tends to have a sclerotic and flattened navicular bone. Symptoms may last for a few weeks or may continue to be present for up to 2 years.[4] An indication of the symptoms residing is the resolution of the acute inflammation and obvious healing of the foot. This means that the affected bone and the Tarsal Navicular begin to regain their normal size, density and structure.[5]",
    "Cause": "The cause of Köhler's disease, has thus far, been declared unknown by scientists.[5] However, it is suspected that possible causes may be caused by strain on the foot and the blood vessels associated with it, before the bone is fully able to grow into its adult form (ossification).[5] This bone ossification usually begins within the first 18 to 24 months of a female's life and the first 24 to 30 months of a male's life. Ossification will occur more slowly on the tarsal navicular bone than on other bones of the foot. This causes an overall loss of blood supply in the areas surrounding, as a result of the compression.[5] Furthermore, some scientists have suggested that genetic factors could play a significant role in the development of the disease, however no direct causation has been identified, nor a disease-causing gene.[5]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is made on the basis of history and a high index of suspicion. On examination there is tenderness to palpation on navicular head. Radiographs reveal typical changes of increased density and narrowing of the navicular bone.[citation needed]",

In acute cases, the patient is often fitted with a cast that stops below the knee. The cast is usually worn for 6 to 8 weeks.

Also, moderate exercise is often beneficial, and physical therapy may help as well.[citation needed]\nPrognosis for children with this disease is very good.

    "Disease": "Krabbe disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Symptoms in asymptomatic infantile-onset (less than 12 months after birth) and later-onset Krabbe disease present themselves differently. Of individuals with infantile-onset KD, 85–90% display progressive neurologic deterioration in infancy and death before the age of two.[5] Symptoms include irritability, fevers, limb stiffness, seizures, feeding difficulties (like gastroesophageal reflux disease), vomiting, staring episodes, and slowing of mental and motor development. In the first stages of the disease, doctors often mistake the symptoms for those of cerebral palsy. Other symptoms include muscle weakness, spasticity, deafness, optic atrophy, optic nerve enlargement,[6] blindness, paralysis, and difficulty when swallowing. Prolonged weight loss may also occur.[citation needed]\nAbout 10–15% of individuals with later-onset KD have a much slower disease progression. These individuals may also display symptoms such as esotropia, slurred speech, and slow development or loss of motor milestones.[5]",
    "Cause": "Krabbe disease is caused by mutations in the GALC gene located on chromosome 14 (14q31),[7] which is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Mutations in the GALC gene cause a deficiency of the enzyme galactosylceramidase (GALC).[8] In rare cases, it may be caused by a lack of active saposin A (a derivative of prosaposin).[1]\nThe buildup of unmetabolized lipids adversely affects the growth of the nerve's protective myelin sheath (the covering that insulates many nerves) resulting in demyelination and severe progressive degeneration of motor skills. As part of a group of disorders known as leukodystrophies, KD results from the imperfect growth and development of myelin.[citation needed]\nGalactosylceramidase deficiency also results in a buildup of the glycosphingolipid psychosine, which is toxic to oligodendrocytes, a type of non-neuronal cells found in the nervous system, collectively termed neuroglia.[9]",
    "Diagnosis": "A few ways to help pinpoint the presence of Krabbe disease are known. Newborn screening for KD includes assaying dried blood cells for GALC enzyme activity and molecular analysis for evidence of GALC enzyme mutations. Infants displaying low enzyme activity and/or enzyme mutations should be referred for additional diagnostic testing and neurological examination.[10] Up to 5% GALC enzyme activity is observed in all symptomatic individuals with Krabbe disease.[5] High concentration of psychosine in dried blood spots may also be identified as a marker for KD.[11] A 2011 study discovered that individuals with KD, more so in later-onset individuals, tend to have an abnormal increase in CSF protein concentration.[12]\nThe disease may be diagnosed by its characteristic grouping of certain cells (multinucleated globoid cells), nerve demyelination and degeneration, and destruction of brain cells. Special stains for myelin (e.g., luxol fast blue) may be used to aid diagnosis[citation needed].\nNew York,[13] Missouri, and Kentucky[14] include KD in their newborn screening panel.[15] Indiana started screening in 2020.[16]",
    "Treatment": "Although no cure for Krabbe disease is known, bone marrow transplantation and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) have been shown to benefit cases early in the course of the disease. Generally, treatment for the disorder is symptomatic and supportive. Physical therapy may help maintain or increase muscle tone and circulation.[citation needed]\nA 15-year study on the developmental outcomes of children with KD who underwent HSCT in the first seven weeks after birth found that patients have a better prognosis for both lifespan and functionality, with a slower disease progression.[17] Even symptomatic individuals with later-onset Krabbe disease may benefit from HSCT if diagnosed early enough.[18] Umbilical-cord blood is typically used as the source for the transplant stem cells.[19] Clinical trials for gene therapy are currently enrolling patients.[20]",
    "Management": "Symptom management can be particularly difficult for individuals with infantile-onset KD, as symptoms tend to progress rapidly.[19] Because no treatment is available for KD, management of the condition is typically supportive and aimed at alleviating symptoms. Frequent evaluation is encouraged to anticipate the onset of and preparation for certain symptoms.[5] Physical therapy can help to alleviate motor difficulties and increase strength, mobility, and flexibility.[5]\nGastrostomy tubes are used to circumvent feeding difficulties and prevent aspiration. A simultaneous gastrostomy tube insertion and Nissen fundoplication procedure is commonly performed to prevent the need for a secondary surgical procedure.[19] Individuals with KD with severe motor deficits tend to be more susceptible to overfeeding, as they require less calorie consumption, thus consuming fewer calories than caretakers may expect.[19] Also, some evidence indicates that routine vaccines may accelerate disease progression; many individuals with KD tend to not follow traditional vaccination procedures.[19]"

Type A causes seizures, myoclonic epilepsy (muscle jerks), dementia, ataxia (compromised muscle coordination), tremors and tics, dysarthria (speech difficulties), confusion, and psychotic behaviour. Although similar to Type A, patients with Type B do not experience myoclonic epilepsy or dysarthria, and they do display changes in personality. Occasionally, patients present with skin disorders causing dryness, roughness, and scaliness. The skin symptoms are a result of keratin buildup in the skin cells (see Genetics for more information).

People who advance to adulthood tend to lose their ability to do daily tasks by themselves, which can require comprehensive care. If their symptoms progress extremely quickly or at an early age, patients receive comprehensive care, which – besides medication – means support during daily activities both physically and mentally.

    "Disease": "Langerhans cell histiocytosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "LCH provokes a non-specific inflammatory response, which includes fever, lethargy, and weight loss. Organ involvement can also cause more specific symptoms.\n• Bone: The most-frequently seen symptom in both unifocal and multifocal disease is painful bone swelling. The skull is most frequently affected, followed by the long bones of the upper extremities and flat bones. Infiltration in hands and feet is unusual. Osteolytic lesions can lead to pathological fractures.[16]\n• Skin: Commonly seen are a rash which varies from scaly erythematous lesions to red papules pronounced in intertriginous areas. Up to 80% of LCH patients have extensive eruptions on the scalp.\n• Bone marrow: Pancytopenia with superadded infection usually implies a poor prognosis. Anemia can be due to a number of factors and does not necessarily imply bone marrow infiltration.\n• Lymph node: Enlargement of the liver in 20%, spleen in 30% and lymph nodes in 50% of Histiocytosis cases.[17]\n• Endocrine glands: Hypothalamic pituitary axis  commonly involved.[18] Central Diabetes insipidus can be the first manifestation of LCH.[19][20]Anterior pituitary hormone deficiency is usually permanent.[21]\n• Lungs: some patients are asymptomatic, diagnosed incidentally because of lung nodules on radiographs; others experience chronic cough and shortness of breath.[22]\n• Less frequently gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system, and oral cavity.[23]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is confirmed histologically by tissue biopsy. Hematoxylin-eosin stain of biopsy slide will show features of Langerhans Cell e.g. distinct cell margin, pink granular cytoplasm.[34] Presence of Birbeck granules on electron microscopy and immuno-cytochemical features e. g. CD1 positivity are more specific. Initially routine blood tests e.g. full blood count, liver function test, U&Es, bone profile are done to determine disease extent and rule out other causes.[35] Electron microscopy or immunohistochemistry (only one of the two is required) may be used to definitively diagnose Langerhans cell histiocytosis, in the presence of other pathologic and histologic qualities of the disease.[36]\nImaging may be evident in chest X-rays with micronodular and reticular changes of the lungs with cyst formation in advanced cases. MRI and High-resolution CT may show small, cavitated nodules with thin-walled cysts. MRI scan of the brain can show three groups of lesions such as tumourous/granulomatous lesions, nontumourous/granulomatous lesions, and atrophy. Tumourous lesions are usually found in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis with space-occupying lesions with or without calcifications. In non-tumourous lesions, there is a symmetrical hyperintense T2 signal with hypointense or hyperintense T1 signal extending from grey matter into the white matter. In the basal ganglia, MRI shows a hyperintense T1 signal in the globus pallidus.[37]\nAssessment of endocrine function and bone marrow biopsy are also performed when indicated.[38]\n• S-100 protein is expressed in a cytoplasmic pattern[39][40]\n• peanut agglutinin (PNA) is expressed on the cell surface and perinuclearly[41][42]\n• major histocompatibility (MHC) class II is expressed (because histiocytes are macrophages)\n• CD1a[39]\n• langerin (CD207), a Langerhans Cell–restricted protein that induces the formation of Birbeck granules and is constitutively associated with them, is a highly specific marker.[43][44]",
    "Treatment": "Guidelines for management of patients up to 18 years with Langerhans cell histiocytosis have been suggested.[45][46][47][48][clarification needed] Treatment is guided by extent of disease. Solitary bone lesion may be amenable through excision or limited radiation, dosage of 5-10 Gy for children, 24-30 Gy for adults. However systemic diseases often require chemotherapy. Use of systemic steroid is common, singly or adjunct to chemotherapy. Local steroid cream is applied to skin lesions. Endocrine deficiency often require lifelong supplement e.g. desmopressin for diabetes insipidus which can be applied as nasal drop. Chemotherapeutic agents such as alkylating agents, antimetabolites, vinca alkaloids either singly or in combination can lead to complete remission in diffuse disease.[citation needed]",

    "Disease": "Laryngeal papillomatosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "A common symptom of laryngeal papillomatosis is a change in voice quality. More specifically, hoarseness is observed.[4][5] As a consequence of the narrowing of the laryngeal or tracheal parts of the airway, shortness of breath, chronic cough and stridor (i.e. noisy breathing which can sound like a whistle or a snore), can be present.[4][5] As the disease progresses, occurrence of secondary symptoms such as dysphagia, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, failure to thrive, and recurrent upper respiratory infections can be diagnosed.[4][5] The risk of laryngeal papillomatosis spreading to the lungs is higher in the juvenile-onset than the adult-onset.[3] In children, symptoms are usually more severe and often mistaken for manifestations of other diseases such as asthma, croup, or bronchitis. Therefore, diagnosis is usually delayed.[8][5]",
    "Cause": "Laryngeal papillomatosis is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, most frequently types 6 and 11,[13] although genotypes 16, 18, 31, and 33 have also been implicated.[7] HPV-11 is associated with more aggressive forms of papillomatosis, which may involve more distal parts of the tracheobronchial tree.[7] The mode of viral inoculation is hypothesized to vary according to the age of disease onset.[13][14] The presence of HPV in the respiratory tract does not necessarily result in the development of laryngeal papillomatosis. Other factors that could be involved include immunodeficiency or other similar infections. For example, laryngeal papillomatosis may become more aggressive due to the presence of certain viruses (e.g., herpes simplex virus, Epstein–Barr virus).[2]\nThe disease occurs in two forms, juvenile and adult papillomatosis, based on whether it develops before or after 20 years of age.[1][7] The juvenile form is generally transmitted through contact with a mother's infected vaginal canal during childbirth.[14] Less is known about transmission in the adult form of this disease, though oral sex has been implicated as a potential mode of transmission.[13][14] However, it is uncertain whether oral sex would directly transmit the virus[14] or activate the dormant virus that was transmitted at childbirth.[14][13]\nIn general, physicians are unsure why only certain people who have been exposed to the HPV types implicated in the disease develop laryngeal papillomatosis. In the case of the juvenile form of the disease, the likelihood of a child born of an infected mother developing laryngeal papillomatosis is low (between 1 in 231 to 1 in 400),[15] even if the mother's infection is active.[13] Risk factors for a higher likelihood of transmission at childbirth include the first birth, vaginal birth, and teenaged mother.[14][13]\nThree major risk factors affect the acquisition of the juvenile variant. These include:[16]\n• Birth history (e.g., increased time spent in vaginal delivery) and the presence of HPV in the vaginal canal. It is important to note that it is still uncertain whether caesarean delivery is a protective factor.\n• Genotype of the HPV (e.g., HPV-11)\n• Individual factors (e.g., being younger when diagnosed, which may be due to a less developed immune system).",
    "Diagnosis": "Laryngeal papillomatosis can be diagnosed through visualization of the lesions using one of several indirect laryngoscopy procedures.[6][8] In indirect laryngoscopy, the tongue is pulled forward and a laryngeal mirror or a rigid scope is passed through the mouth to examine the larynx.[12][6] Another variation of indirect laryngoscopy involves passing a flexible scope, known as a fiberscope or endoscope, through the nose and into the throat to visualize the larynx from above.[12][8] This procedure is also called flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy.[12]\nThe appearance of papillomas has been described as multiple or rarely, single, white growths with a lumpy texture similar to cauliflower.[12][7] Papillomas usually present in the larynx, especially on the vocal folds and in the space above the vocal folds called the ventricles.[17][18][1] They can spread to other parts of the larynx and throughout the aerodigestive tract, from the mouth to the lower respiratory tract.[1][7][17] Spread to regions beyond the larynx is more common in children than adults.[17] Growths tend to be located at normal junctions in squamous and ciliated epithelium or at tissue junctions arising from injury.[1][17][18]\nA confirmatory diagnosis of laryngeal papillomatosis can only be obtained through a biopsy, involving microscopic examination and HPV testing of a sample of the growth.[7][6] Biopsy samples are collected under general anesthesia, either through direct laryngoscopy or fiberoptic bronchoscopy.[6][7]",
    "Treatment": "As of 2014, there was no permanent cure for laryngeal papillomatosis, and treatment options aimed to remove and limit the recurrence of the papillomas.[9] Repeated treatments are often needed because of the recurrent nature of the virus, especially for children, as the juvenile form of laryngeal papillomatosis often triggers more aggressive relapses than the adult form.[9][2][7][10] Between recurrences, voice therapy may be used to restore or maintain the person's voice function.[12]",

    "Disease": "Leber congenital amaurosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "LCA symptoms typically begin in the first few months of life, most commonly with involuntary twitching of the eye (nystagmus). Affected infants may show misaligned eyes when looking at something (strabismus), aversion to light (photophobia), and poke or rub at their eyes (Franceschetti's oculodigital sign).[9] Those with LCA invariably experience vision problems. Affected infants show decreased visual response to objects. Loss of visual acuity is severe, with affected individuals' vision ranging from 20/200 to 20/400.[note 1] Around a third of those affected completely lose perception of light.[10]\nAt an eye exam, the pupils may not respond normally to light. Some affected individuals have cloudy eyes (cataracts), and irregularly shaped corneas (keratoconus).[9] Retinal exams typically look normal, especially in the young, though retinal abnormalities can appear later in life.[10]\nAside from eye problems, children with LCA are typically healthy.[11]",
    "Cause": "LCA is a genetic disease and can be caused by pathogenic variants in at least 28 different genes.[12] Variants in three of these genes – IMPDH1, OTX2, and CRX – can cause LCA in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning inheriting a single copy of a pathogenic variant can result in disease. Variants in the remaining genes associated with LCA cause disease in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning one must inherit copies of the pathogenic variant from both parents to develop LCA.[12] Genes associated with LCA have a variety of roles in the development of the eye:\n• OTX2 is involved in the development of the retina;\n• CRB1, CRX, GDF6, and PRPH2 in the formation of retinal photoreceptor cells;\n• AIPL1 and GUCY2D in phototransduction (converting light into electrical signals for the brain);\n• ALMS1, CCT2, CEP290, CLUAP1, IFT140, IQCB1, LCA5, MYO7A, RD3,  RPGRIP1, SPATA7, and TULP1 in maintaining the cilia on photoreceptor cells;\n• LRAT, RDH12, and RPE65 in replenishing retinal levels for the visual cycle;\n• IMPDH1 in guanine synthesis (involved in maintaining retinal levels);\n• CABP4, CNGA3, and KCNJ13 in photoreceptor response to light.[12][13]\nPathogenic variants of any of these genes cause dysfunction in those associated processes, which leads to severe vision loss. Variants in DTHD1 and NMNAT1 also cause LCA, though these genes' roles in vision development are not yet known.[13]\nAmong the gene variants that cause LCA, CEP290 and GUCYD variants are the most common, each causing up to 20% of LCA cases. Other common variants are in CRB1 (around 10% of cases), RPE65 (up to 10%), AIPL1 (up to 8%), RDH12 (up to 5%), and RPGRIP1 (around 5%).[14] Around 25% of people with LCA do not have any of the known LCA-causing pathogenic gene variants; the cause of their LCA is unknown.[12]",
    "Diagnosis": "LCA is diagnosed clinically, by a combination of vision loss, an abnormal response of the pupils to light, and by abnormal response to electroretinography, a test that measures the electrical response of the retina to light.[10]",
    "Treatment": "One form of LCA, in patients with LCA2 bearing a mutation in the RPE65 gene, has been successfully treated in clinical trials using gene therapy. The results of three early clinical trials were published in 2008 demonstrating the safety and efficacy of using adeno-associated virus to deliver gene therapy to restore vision in LCA patients. In all three clinical trials, patients recovered functional vision without apparent side effects.[5][6][7][8] These studies, which used adeno-associated virus, have spawned a number of new studies investigating gene therapy for human retinal disease.[citation needed] On 19 December 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved voretigene neparvovec-rzyl (Luxturna), an adeno-associated virus vector-based gene therapy for children and adults with biallelic RPE65 gene mutations responsible for retinal dystrophy, including Leber congenital amaurosis. Patients must have viable retinal cells as a prerequisite for the intraocular administration of Luxturna.[15] Another recent trial from The OHSU Casey Eye Institute used CRISPR to treat LCA starting in 2020. The experimental treatment consisted in editing a mutation of the CEP290 gene, which provides instructions to create a protein that is critical for sight. Results were released in 2023 with 79% of the patients showing improvement in at least one of four measured outcomes.[16]\nFor those who cannot benefit from gene therapy, LCA treatment is supportive, and meant to facilitate living with visual impairment. Some benefit from vision aids such as glasses, magnifiers, and enhancers. Other resources helpful for those with visual impairment include educational programs, special education teachers, and service animals.[17]",

    "Disease": "Legg–Calvé–Perthes disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The condition is most commonly found in children between the ages of 4 and 10. Common symptoms include pain in the hip, knee, or ankle (since hip pathology can cause pain to be felt in a normal knee or ankle), or in the groin; this pain is exacerbated by hip or leg movement, especially internal hip rotation (with the knee flexed 90°, twisting the lower leg away from the center of the body). The range of motion is reduced, particularly in abduction and internal rotation, and the patient presents with a limp. Pain is usually mild. Atrophy of thigh muscles may occur from disuse and an inequality of leg length. In some cases, some activity can cause severe irritation or inflammation of the damaged area, including standing, walking, running, kneeling, or stooping repeatedly for an extended period. In cases exhibiting severe femoral osteonecrosis, pain is usually a chronic, throbbing sensation exacerbated by activity[1]\nThe first signs are complaints of soreness from the child, which are often dismissed as growing pains, and limping or other joint guarding, particularly when tired. The pain is usually in the hip, but can also be felt in the knee (referred pain). In some cases, pain is felt in the unaffected hip and leg,[2] due to the children favoring their injured side and placing the majority of their weight on their \"good\" leg. It is predominantly a disease of boys (4:1 ratio). Perthes is generally diagnosed between 5 and 12 years of age, although it has been diagnosed as early as 18 months. Typically, the disease is only seen in one hip, but bilateral Perthes is seen in about 10% of children diagnosed.[3]",
    "Cause": "Perthes disease is a childhood hip disorder initiated by a disruption of blood flow to the head of the femur. Due to the lack of blood flow, the bone dies (osteonecrosis or avascular necrosis) and stops growing.[4]\nLegg believed the cause was impairment of blood supply to the femoral epiphysis, Calvé believed rickets, and Perthes deduced an infection possibly causing degenerative arthritis leads to LCP disease. Currently, a number of factors have been implicated, including heredity, trauma, endocrine dysfunction, inflammation, nutrition, and altered circulatory hemodynamics.[5]\nRisk factors are not limited to impaired and disproportionate growth, low birth weight, delayed skeletal maturity, short stature, systemic hormonal changes, and low economic index.[6] Although no one has identified the cause of Perthes disease, a reduction in blood flow to the joint is known.[4]\nThe disease is theorized to include the artery of the ligamentum teres femoris being constricted or even blocked too early, not allowing for time when the medial circumflex femoral artery takes over. The medial circumflex femoral artery is the principal source of blood supply to the femoral head. LCP disease is a vascular restrictive condition of idiopathic nature. Symptoms like femoral head disfigurement, flattening, and collapse occur typically between ages four and ten, mostly male children of Caucasian descent. Children affected by LCP disease often display uneven gait and limited range of motion, and they experience mild to severe pain in the groin area.[7] For example, a child may be six years old chronologically but may have grown only four years old in terms of bone maturity. The child may then engage in activities appropriate for a six-year-old child, but lacking the bone strength of an older child, these activities may lead to flattening or fracture of the hip joint. Genetics do not appear to be a determining factor, but a deficiency of blood factors with anticoagulant property used to disperse blood clots may lead to blockages in the vessels supplying the joint. A deficiency of protein C and protein S, which also act as blood anticoagulants, may also exist; if that were the case, their deficiency could cause clot formation in ligamentum teres femoris artery and hinder blood supply to the femoral head. However, no evidence of this has been found; over the years, many theories have been published, but none has stood up to professional research.[8]",
    "Diagnosis": "X-rays of the hip may suggest and/or verify the diagnosis. X-rays usually demonstrate a flattened, and later fragmented, femoral head. A bone scan or MRI may be useful in making the diagnosis in those cases where X-rays are inconclusive. Usually, plain radiographic changes are delayed six weeks or more from clinical onset, so bone scintigraphy and MRI are done for early diagnosis. MRI results are more accurate, i.e. 97–99% against 88–93% in plain radiography. If MRI or bone scans are necessary, a positive diagnosis relies upon patchy areas of vascularity to the capital femoral epiphysis (the developing femoral head).[11]",
    "Treatment": "The goals of treatment are to decrease pain, reduce the loss of hip motion, and prevent or minimize permanent femoral head deformity so that the risk of developing a severe degenerative arthritis as an adult can be reduced.[12] Assessment by a pediatric orthopaedic surgeon is recommended to evaluate risks and treatment options. Younger children have a better prognosis than older children.[13]\nThere is no high quality evidence to guide treatments, though a nationwide study (called a randomised controlled trial) has recently started throughout the UK, which could improve the evidence in future - called the OpNonSTOP study (see research direction). Until then, treatment decisions are based largely on case series and experience.\nTreatment has historically centered on removing mechanical pressure from the joint until the disease has run its course. Options include traction (to separate the femur from the pelvis and reduce wear), braces (often for several months, with an average of 18 months) to restore range of motion, physiotherapy, and surgical intervention when necessary because of permanent joint damage. To maintain activities of daily living, custom orthotics may be used. Overnight traction may be used in lieu of walking devices or in combination.[14]  These devices internally rotate the femoral head and abduct the leg(s) at 45°. Orthoses can start as proximal as the lumbar spine, and extend the length of the limbs to the floor. Most functional bracing is achieved using a waist belt and thigh cuffs derived from the Scottish-Rite orthosis.[15] These devices are typically prescribed by a physician and implemented by an orthotist. Clinical results of the Scottish Rite orthosis have not been good according to some studies, and its use has gone out of favor. Many children, especially those with the onset of the disease before age 6, need no intervention at all and are simply asked to refrain from contact sports or games which impact the hip. For older children (onset of Perthes after age 6), the best treatment option remains unclear. Current treatment options for older children over age 8 include prolonged periods without weight bearing, osteotomy (femoral, pelvic, or shelf), and the hip distraction method using an external fixator which relieves the hip from carrying the body's weight. This allows room for the top of the femur to regrow.[9]\nWhile running and high-impact sports are not recommended during treatment for Perthes disease, children can remain active through a variety of other activities that limit mechanical stress on the hip joint. Swimming is highly recommended, as it allows exercise of the hip muscles with full range of motion while reducing the stress to a minimum. Cycling is another good option as it also keeps stress to a minimum. Physiotherapy generally involves a series of daily exercises, with weekly meetings with a physiotherapist to monitor progress. These exercises focus on improving and maintaining a full range of motion of the femur within the hip socket. Performing these exercises during the healing process is essential to ensure that the femur and hip socket have a perfectly smooth interface. This will minimize the long-term effects of the disease. Use of bisphosphonate such as zoledronate or ibandronate is currently being investigated, but definite recommendations are not yet available.[16][17]\nPerthes disease is self-limiting, but if the head of femur is left deformed, long-term problems can occur. Treatment is aimed at minimizing damage while the disease runs its course, not at 'curing' the disease. It is recommended not to use steroids or alcohol as these reduce oxygen in the blood which is needed in the joint. As those affected age, problems in the knee and back can arise secondary to abnormal posture and stride adopted to protect the affected joint. The condition is also linked to arthritis of the hip, though this appears not to be an inevitable consequence. Hip replacements are relatively common as the already damaged hip experiences routine wear; this varies by individual, but generally is required any time after age 50.[18]",

Regardless of the subtype of Langerhans cell histiocytosis, the pathologic hallmark for all subtypes of LCH is the abnormal proliferation and accumulation of immature Langerhans cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, and eosinophils. The collection of these cells is what forms granulomatous lesions. Histiocytes, a type of white blood cell, are part of the body's immune system. When produced in excess, like in LCH and LSD, they attack the body's systems and cause the physical manifestations that are seen in these patients.[5]\nThere have been associated gene mutations linked to Abt-Letterer-Siwe disease. LSD, in addition to all forms of LCH, is an oncogene-driven cancer of myeloid lineage. Activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway is seen in all patients with LCH. In 50-60% of patients with LCH, oncogenic mutations of BRAFV600E are identified. 10-15% of patients have MAP2K1 mutations.[1]\nLSD has no clear association with hereditary or familial tendencies.[3]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosing Letterer-Siwe disease requires a complete work-up and examination because its symptoms are often non-specific and appear like other benign conditions. A diagnosis of LSD can be made with positive biochemical findings suggestive of LSD in addition to evidence of multi-organ involvement.[8] The diagnosis is established by biopsy. Pathology then uses immunohistochemical characteristics, such as cell surface markers CD1a, CD207, and S-100, to help identify the Langerhans cells. Because of the link LCH has to BRAFV600E and other MAPK pathway mutations, tumor tissue should be tested for associated mutations.[1]\nElectron microscopy will show racket-like Langerhans cell granules within the specific infiltrating cells. The demonstration of these organelles allows the unequivocal diagnosis in cases with uncharacteristic clinical or histopathological appearance. The same structures are characteristic of Hand-Schüller-Christian disease and of eosinophilic granuloma. The electron microscopic findings confirm the grouping of these three diseases together as \"histiocytosis X\".[citation needed]\nIn order to evaluate the degree of organ involvement in these patients, physicians may conduct a variety of diagnostic tests, such as",

    "Disease": "Leukocyte adhesion deficiency",
    "Signs and symptoms": "LAD was first recognized as a distinct clinical entity in the 1970s. The classic descriptions of LAD included recurrent bacterial infections, defects in neutrophil adhesion, and a delay in umbilical cord sloughing. The adhesion defects result in poor leukocyte chemotaxis, particularly neutrophil, inability to form pus and neutrophilia.[3]\nIndividuals with LAD suffer from bacterial infections beginning in the neonatal period. Infections such as omphalitis, pneumonia, gingivitis, and peritonitis are common and often life-threatening due to the infant's inability to properly destroy the invading pathogens. These individuals do not form abscesses because granulocytes cannot migrate to the sites of infection.",
    "Cause": "Types of leukocyte adhesion deficiency include LAD1, LAD2, and LAD3. LAD1 is the most common.[4]\nPatients with LAD1 have an inherited molecular defect that causes a deficiency of the β-2 integrin subunit,[5] also called CD18, which is encoded by the ITGB2 gene found on chromosome 21. This subunit is involved in the formation of the β-2 integrins (LFA-1, integrin alphaXbeta2/CR4/p150,95, and Mac-1/CR3) by dimerization with different CD11 subunits.[6][7]\nMutations in the ITGB2 gene lead to absent, reduced, or aberrant CD18 protein expression, causing a lack of expression in the leukocyte membrane of the β-2 integrins. The main function of these proteins is to allow neutrophils to make their way out of the blood stream and into the infected tissues by adhering to different ligands expressed by the endothelium, e.g. ICAM-1. In LAD-I patients, neutrophils cannot extravasate and fight against bacteria in tissues. The bacteria can then proliferate, leading to symptomatic infection, which can spread unimpeded and cause serious injury to important tissues.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "Typically, diagnosis involves several preliminary tests of immune function, including basic evaluation of the humoral immune system and the cell-mediated immune system. A WBC differential will reveal extremely elevated levels of neutrophils (on the order of 6–10x normal) because they are unable to leave the blood vessels.\nIn the case of LAD-I, specific diagnosis is done by flow cytometry. This technique will reveal absent or reduced CD18 expression in the leukocyte membrane. Recently, prenatal diagnosis systems has been established, allowing an early detection of the disease.\nLAD-II diagnosis includes the study of different glycosylated forms of the transferrin protein.

    "Disease": "Leukodystrophy",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Some specific symptoms vary from one type of leukodystrophy to the next, but the vast majority of symptoms are shared as the causes for the disease generally have the same effects. Symptoms are dependent on the age of onset, which is predominantly in infancy and early childhood, although the exact time of onset may be difficult to determine. Hyperirritability and hypersensitivity to the environment are common, as well as some tell-tale physical signs including muscle rigidity and a backwards-bent head.[6] Botox therapy is often used to treat patients with spasticity.[7] Juvenile and adult onsets display similar symptoms including a decrease or loss in hearing and vision. While children do experience optic and auditory degeneration, the course of the disease is usually too rapid, causing death relatively quickly, whereas adults may live with these conditions for many years. In children, spastic activity often precedes progressive ataxia and rapid cognitive deterioration which has been described as intellectual disability.[8] Epilepsy is commonplace for patients of all ages.[9] More progressed patients show weakness in deglutition, leading to spastic coughing fits due to inhaled saliva. Classic symptomatic progression of juvenile X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is shown in the 1992 film, Lorenzo's Oil.[10]\nCourse and timetable are dependent on the age of onset with infants showing a lifespan of 2–8 years, juveniles 2–10 years and adults typically 10+ years. Adults typically see an extended period of stability followed by a decline to a vegetative state and death.[6] While treatments do exist, most are in the experimental phase and can only promise a halt in the progression of symptoms, although some gene therapies have shown some symptomatic improvement.[11] The debilitating course of the disease has led to numerous philosophical and ethical arguments over experimental clinical trials, patients' rights and physician-assisted suicide.[12]",
    "Cause": "While the more specific underlying causes of leukodystrophy are dependent upon the type, there are common pathophysiological patterns that can be seen amongst all types. First and foremost, leukodystrophy is a neurodegenerative disease that is always the result of both impairment and maintenance of myelin sheaths surrounding neuronal axons in the central nervous system as the result of a genetic mutation.[13] Myelin is a fatty white substance that acts as an electrical insulator and coats axons in order to speed up impulses (i.e., action potentials) traveling down the axon. Thus, the natural result of a loss of this substance is decreased efficiency in impulse propagation. As myelin is produced by oligodendrocytes (a type of glial cell) in the central nervous system, an easy place to look for the cause is a mutation or malfunctioning of these cells and in other glial cells.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "The degeneration of white matter, which reflects the degeneration of myelin, can be seen in a basic MRI and used to diagnose leukodystrophies of all types. T-1 and T-2 weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images are the most often used approach.[25] Electrophysiological and other kinds of laboratory testing can also be done. In particular, nerve conduction velocity is looked at to distinguish between leukodystrophy and other demyelinating diseases, as well as to distinguish between individual leukodystrophies. For example, individuals with X-ALD have normal conduction velocities, while those with Krabbe disease or metachromatic leukodystrophy have abnormalities in their conduction velocities.[25] Multigene sequencing panels for undifferentiated leukodystrophy are offered for rapid molecular diagnosis after genetic counselling.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "With many different types of leukodystrophy, with many causes, treatment therapies will vary for each type. Studies and clinical trials are seeking to find therapies for each of the different leukodystrophies. Stem cell transplants and gene therapy appear to be the most promising in treating all leukodystrophies, providing they take place as early as possible, prior to extensive neurological damage.\nFor hypomyelinating leukodystrophies, therapeutic research into cell-based therapies appears promising. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells and neural stem cells have been transplanted successfully and have shown to be healthy a year later. Fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity maps showed possible myelination in the region of the transplant.[26][needs update] Induced pluripotent stem cells, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, gene correction, and transplantation to promote the maturation, survival, and myelination of oligodendrocytes seem to be the primary routes for possible treatments.[26][needs update]\nFor three types of leukodystrophies (X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) and Krabbe Disease (globoid cell leukodystrophy - GLD), gene therapy using autologous hematopoietic stem cells to transfer the healthy copy of the disease-causing gene with lentiviral vectors has been shown to succeed and has been used in clinical trials for X-ALD and MLD.[11][27] The progression of X-ALD has been shown to be disrupted with hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy, although the proximal cause of arrested demyelination and the quantity of stem cells needed are unclear.[11] While there continues to be an accumulation of very long chain fatty acids in the brain, this seems not to be the immediate causal factor behind the disease, as gene therapy does not correct the accumulation.[11][needs update]\nFor those leukodystrophies that result from a deficiency of lysozyme enzymes, such as Krabbe disease, enzyme replacement therapy seems hopeful. However, enzyme delivery proves difficult, because the blood–brain barrier severely limits what can pass into the central nervous system.[11] Current gene therapy research for metachromatic leukodystrophy has been reviewed with an emphasis on ex vivo transplantation of genetically modified hematopoietic stem cells.[28][needs update]",

Symptoms include cerebellar ataxia, spasticity, optic atrophy, epilepsy,[2] loss of motor functions, irritability, vomiting, coma,[3] and even fever has been tied to VWM.[4]  The neurological disorders and symptoms which occur with VWM are not specific to countries; they are the same all over the world.[5]  Neurological abnormalities may not always be present in those who experience onset as adults. Symptoms generally appear in young children or infants who were previously developing fairly normally.[citation needed]",
    "Cause": "VWM is a leukodystrophy which has unique biochemical abnormalities.[4]  A unique characteristic of VWM is that only oligodendrocytes and astrocytes are negatively affected while other glial cells and neurons seem to be unaffected. This is the central question behind VWM. The real reasons behind this behavior are unknown since the cells are in the brain and have been rarely studied. However, there is a theory which is generally accepted by most experts in the field. The main characteristic of these cells is the fact that they synthesize a lot of proteins. These cells produce a large amount of proteins from a small amount of precursors and so are constantly working and under a reasonable amount of stress. So with a mutation in eIF2B, slight increases in the amount of stress these cells encounter occur, making them more susceptible to failure due to stress.[5] The large amount of oligodendrocytes which display apoptotic characteristics and express apoptotic proteins suggests cell number reduction in the early stages of the disease.[2] Premature ovarian failure has also been associated with diminishing white matter.  However through an intensive survey, it was determined that even if an individual has premature ovarian failure, she does not necessarily have VWM.[6]",
    "Diagnosis": "Most diagnosis occurs in the early years of life around 2 to 6 years old.[3]   There have been cases in which onset and diagnosis have occurred late into adulthood.  Those with onset at this time have different signs, particularly the lack of cognitive deterioration.  Overall, detection of adult forms of VWM is difficult as MRI was not a common tool when they were diagnosed.[4]  Common signs to look for include chronic progressive neurological deterioration with cerebellar ataxia, spasticity, mental decline, decline of vision, mild epilepsy, hand tremor, the ability to chew and swallow food becomes difficult, rapid deterioration and fibrile infections following head trauma or fright, loss of motor functions, irritability, behavioural changes, vomiting, and even coma.  Those who go into coma, if they do come out usually die within a few years.[3] The diagnosis can be difficult if the physician does not take an MRI.[5]",
    "Treatment": "There are no treatments, only precautions which can be taken, mainly to reduce trauma to the head and avoiding physiological stress.[3] Melatonin has been shown to provide cytoprotective traits to glial cells exposed to stressors such as excitotoxicity and oxidative stress. These stressors would be detrimental to cells with a genetically reduced activity of protein eIF2B. However, research connecting these ideas have not been conducted yet.[5]",

    "Cause": "Leydig cell hypoplasia is caused by genetic mutations in LHCGR, a gene which encodes the LH/hCG receptor. LH normally acts through the LH/hCG receptor to stimulate the growth of Leydig cells in the testicles and the production of androgens such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by these cells. In Leydig cell hypoplasia however, there is a reduced capacity for the LH/hCG receptor to respond to LH. This results in hypoplasia or absence of Leydig cells, testicular atrophy, and lower than normal androgen levels. In the most severe form of the condition in which there is a complete lack of response of the Leydig cells to LH, androgen production by the testicles is virtually negligible and secondary sexual characteristics entirely fail to develop at puberty.[2][3][7][8][9]",
    "Diagnosis": "Since the Sertoli cells are not affected by Leydig cell hypoplasia, anti-Müllerian hormone is secreted normally and so there are no Müllerian structures. Wolffian structures, such as the prostate, vasa deferentia, and epidydimides are present. In type I, abdominal testes are revealed on ultrasound; in type II testes may be descended or undescended.[citation needed]\nPeople with Leydig cell hypoplasia type I display no response to the hCG stimulation test; there is no increase in serum levels of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone.[10] Leydig cell hypoplasia type II can display either a pronounced rise of testosterone levels or no rise. [citation needed]\nIn any case, the diagnosis is confirmed on biopsy of the testes, revealing either absent or hypoplastic Leydig cells. The inside of the testis will be grayish and mucous, displaying arrested spermatogenesis and the presence of Sertoli cells.[11] The diagnosis can also be confirmed by looking for mutations in the gene for the LH receptor.[12]\nA diagnosis of Leydig cell hypoplasia is usually made in the neonatal period, following the discovery of ambiguous genitalia, or at puberty, when secondary sex characteristics fail to develop. Puberty is the most common time for Leydig cell hypoplasia to be diagnosed.[11][13]",
    "Treatment": "Patients with Leydig cell hypoplasia may be treated with hormone replacement therapy (i.e., with androgens), which will result in normal sexual development and the resolution of most symptoms. In the case of 46,XY (genetically \"male\") individuals who are phenotypically female and/or have a female gender identity, estrogens are recommended instead.

    "Diagnosis": "Traditionally, LBWC is diagnosed by the presence of at least two of the three Van Allen criteria:[2]\n• Exencephaly or encephalocele with facial clefts\n• Abdominal wall defects: thoracoschisis and/or abdominoschisis\n• Limb defects\nAs a component of the abdominal wall defect, the umbilical cord is shortened or absent with the fetus being directly attached to the placenta, a key feature in its prenatal diagnosis by ultrasound.[3]\nSeveral systems have been proposed to classify LBWC cases phenotypically. Russo et al. (1993) proposed two types distinguished by the presence or absence of craniofacial defects.[4] Sahinoglu et al. (2007) proposed three types based on the anatomical location of defects:[5]\n• Type 1: Craniofacial defect and intact thoracoabdominal wall; rarely, placenta or umbilical cord attachment to cranial structures\n• Type 2: Supraumbilical thoracoabdominal wall defect with abdominal organ eventration into the amniotic sac; defective umbilical cord\n• Type 3: Infraumbilical abdominal wall defect with broad placenta attachment and abdominal organ eventration into the gestational sac; malformed or absent cloacal structures\nIn all types of LBWC, some of the fetus's organs develop outside of its body,[6] and the placenta will adhere to the affected body structure (cranium, thorax, or abdomen).[7] The umbilical cord is significantly shortened. As a consequence, the developing spine and limbs are contorted, leading to scoliosis and limb defects.[1]\nLBWC can be diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound as early as gestational week 11.[8] Elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels in maternal serum may suggest the possibility of LBWC or another anomaly, motivating ultrasound follow-up.[7] Due to LBWC's extremely poor prognosis, termination of the pregnancy is typically recommended.[1][5][7]",

Intact tissue samples typical show abundant mature-appearing adipose (i.e. fat) tissue[11] mixed with a minor component of oval-shaped or spindle-shaped fibroblast-like cells some of which have a pseudolipoblast-like morphology.[8] Needle biopsies should show these cells. However, LPF histopathology can vary widely between cases. The cited gene abnormalities in the above section are insufficient to support a diagnosis of LPF although further study of these and discoveries of other gene abnormalities may do so.[11] The histopathology of lipofibromatosis-like neural tumors (LPF-NT) can closely resemble LPF tumors. Unlike LPF tumors, however, LPF-NT tumors have been diagnosed in adults in more than 27% of cases with the remaining cases diagnosed in children not younger than 14 months/old.[17] Moreover, LPF tumor cells, but not LPF tumor cells, commonly express a fusion gene containing a part of the NTRK1 gene.[11]",

Other features may include cleft palate and a blue/gray appearance of the white of the eyes. Cardiac defects and club foot may be noted at birth.[7]\nThere is overlap in the manifestations of Loeys–Dietz and Marfan syndromes, including increased risk of ascending aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection, abnormally long limbs and fingers, and dural ectasia (a gradual stretching and weakening of the dura mater that can cause abdominal and leg pain). Findings of hypertelorism (widely spaced eyes), bifid or split uvula, and skin findings such as easy bruising or abnormal scars may distinguish Loeys–Dietz from Marfan syndrome.[citation needed]\nAffected individuals often develop immune system related problems such as allergies to food, asthma, hay fever, and inflammatory disorders such as eczema or inflammatory bowel disease.[citation needed]\nFindings of Loeys–Dietz syndrome may include:[citation needed]\n• Skeletal malformations\nCraniosynostosis\nScoliosis\nKyphosis\nSpinal instability and spondylolisthesis\nSternal abnormalities (pectus excavatum/pectus carinatum)\nJoint hypermobility\nCamptodactyly\nLong fingers\nClub foot\n• Craniosynostosis\n• Scoliosis\n• Kyphosis\n• Spinal instability and spondylolisthesis\n• Sternal abnormalities (pectus excavatum/pectus carinatum)\n• Joint hypermobility\n• Camptodactyly\n• Long fingers\n• Club foot\n• Facial abnormalities\nWeakened or missing eye muscles (strabismus)\nWidely spaced eyes (hypertelorism)\n• Weakened or missing eye muscles (strabismus)\n• Widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism)\n• Congenital heart defects\nPatent ductus arteriosus\nAtrial septal defect\nBicuspid aortic valve\nCrossed pulmonary arteries[citation needed]\n• Patent ductus arteriosus\n• Atrial septal defect\n• Bicuspid aortic valve\n• Crossed pulmonary arteries[citation needed]\n• Translucency of the skin with a velvety texture\n• Arnold–Chiari malformation",

Previous research in laboratory mice has suggested that the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan, which appears to block TGF-beta activity, can slow or halt the formation of aortic aneurysms in Marfan syndrome. A large clinical trial sponsored by the National Institutes of Health is currently underway to explore the use of losartan to prevent aneurysms in Marfan syndrome patients. Both Marfan syndrome and Loeys–Dietz syndrome are associated with increased TGF-beta signaling in the vessel wall. Therefore, losartan also holds promise for the treatment of Loeys–Dietz syndrome. In those patients in which losartan is not halting the growth of the aorta, irbesartan has been shown to work and is currently also being studied and prescribed for some patients with this condition.[citation needed]\nIf an increased heart rate is present, a cardioselective beta-1 blocker, with or without losartan, is sometimes prescribed to reduce the heart rate to prevent any extra pressure on the tissue of the aorta. Likewise, strenuous physical activity is discouraged in patients, especially weight lifting and contact sports.[9]",

    "Disease": "Lutembacher's syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "As Lutembacher's syndrome is known for ASD and MS, most of the symptoms experienced will be associated with ASD and MS. For most people, they will remain asymptomatic (experience no symptoms) but when symptoms are shown, they are due mainly to ASD and will vary depending on the size of the hole in the atria. If the patient has a large ASD, pulmonary congestion (blood or fluid buildup in the lungs) will happen later but if the patient has a small ASD, symptoms will appear early in the disorder. In general, unless the ASD and mitral stenosis causing Lutembacher's syndrome is severe, symptoms may not appear until the second and third decade of the patient's life.[citation needed] As many of the patients are asymptomatic and symptoms may not appear until later in life, the duration or frequency of the symptoms varies. For symptoms such as palpitations, ventricular overload, heart failure, and pulmonary congestion, these symptoms may be sudden and not that frequent as they are very severe symptoms. For symptoms such as loud mitral S1, pulmonary S2, mid-diastolic murmur, fatigue, reduced exercise tolerance, weight gain, ankle edema, and right upper quadrant pain, and ascities, these symptoms may be less frequent and severe; their duration may be only a few seconds, minutes, or even months.[citation needed]",
    "Cause": "Lutembacher is caused indirectly by heart damage or disorders. Lutembacher's syndrome is caused by either birth defects where the heart fails to close all holes in the walls between the atria or from an episode of rheumatic fever where damage is done to the heart valves such as the mitral valve and resultant in an opening of heart wall between atria. With Lutembacher's syndrome, a fetus or infant is usually seen to have a hole in their heart wall (interatrial) separating their right and left atria.[7]  Normally during fetal development, blood bypasses the lungs and is oxygenated from the placenta. Blood passes from the umbilical cord and flows into the left atrium through an opening called the foramen ovale; the foramen ovale is a hole between the two atria.[7] Once a baby is born and the lungs begin to fill with air and the blood flow of the heart changes, a tissue flap (somewhat like a trap door) called the septum primum closes the foramen ovale or hole between the two atria and becomes part of the atrial wall. The failure of the hole between the two atria to close after birth leads to a disorder called ASD primum.[7] The most common problems with an opening found in the heart with Lutembacher's syndrome is Ostium Secundum. Ostium Secundum is a hole that is found within the flap of tissue (septum primum) that will eventually close the hole between the two atria after birth. With either type of ASD, ASD will usually cause the blood flow from the right atrium to skip going to the right ventricle and instead flow to the left atrium. If mitral stenosis (the hardening of flap of tissue known as a valve which opens and closes between the left atrium and ventricle to control blood flow) is also present, blood will flow into the right atrium through the hole between the atria wall instead of flowing into the left ventricle and systemic circulation.[1][7] Eventually this leads to other problems such as the right ventricle failing and a reduced blood flow to the left ventricle.[1]\nIn addition to the ASD, MS can either be acquired (present either from an episode of rheumatic fever or the mother has or had rheumatic fever during the pregnancy) or congenital (the child being born with the disorder). With the combination of both ASD and MS, the heart can be under severe strain as it tries to move blood throughout the heart and lungs.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "Lutembacher's syndrome is diagnosis primarily by physical examinations for heart sounds, electrocardiograms, chest radiogram, transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography, color flow mapping, and Doppler imaging. Use of the various test can help to differentiate other possible conditions such as mitral regurgitation, Ebstein disease, ventricular septal defect (VSD).[9]",
    "Treatment": "To treat Lutembacher's syndrome, the underlying causes of the disorder must first be treated: mitral stenosis and atrial septal defect. Lutembacher's syndrome is usually treated surgically with treatments such as:[citation needed]\n• percutaneous transcatheter therapy for MS\n• Device closure of ASD\nPercutaneous transcatheter treatment for the MS can include transcatheter therapies of such as balloon valvuloplasty.",

    "Disease": "Lymphangioleiomyomatosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The average age of onset is the early-to-mid-30s.[3][4][5][6] Exertional dyspnea (shortness of breath) and spontaneous pneumothorax (lung collapse) have been reported as the initial presentation of the disease in 49% and 46% of patients, respectively.[6]\nDiagnosis is typically delayed 5 to 6 years.[3][4][5][6] The condition is often misdiagnosed as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The first pneumothorax, or lung collapse, precedes the diagnosis of LAM in 82% of patients.[7][8] The consensus clinical definition of LAM includes multiple symptoms:[citation needed]\n• Fatigue\n• Cough\n• Coughing up blood (rarely massive)\n• Chest pain\n• Chylous complications arising from lymphatic obstruction, including\nChylothorax\nChylous ascites\nChylopericardium\nChyloptysis\nChyluria\nChyle in vaginal discharge\nChyle in stool\n• Chylothorax\n• Chylous ascites\n• Chylopericardium\n• Chyloptysis\n• Chyluria\n• Chyle in vaginal discharge\n• Chyle in stool\n• Angiomyolipomas (fatty kidney tumors) are present in about 30% of patients with sporadic LAM and up to 90% of patients with TSC-LAM.[9][10] Angiomyolipomas can sometimes spontaneously bleed, causing pain or low blood pressure.\n• Cystic lymphangiomas or lymph nodes with hypodense centers, which mimic necrotizing lymphomas, ovarian or renal cancers, or other malignancies can occur in the retroperitoneum, pelvis or mediastinum.[11][12][13][14]\nLung destruction in LAM is a consequence of diffuse infiltration by neoplastic smooth muscle-like cells that invade all lung structures including the lymphatics, airway walls, blood vessels and interstitial spaces.[15] The consequences of vessel and airway obstruction include chylous fluid accumulations, hemoptysis, airflow obstruction and pneumothorax. The typical disease course displays progressive dyspnea on exertion, spaced by recurrent pneumothoraces and in some patients, chylous pleural effusions or ascites.[16]\nMost people have dyspnea on exertion with daily activities by 10 years after symptom onset. Many patients require supplemental oxygen over that interval.[7]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "LAM can come to medical attention in several ways, most of which trigger a chest CT. Thin-walled cystic change in the lungs may be found incidentally on CT scans of the heart, chest or abdomen (on the cuts that include lung bases) obtained for other purposes. HRCTs of TSC patients reveals that about 20% of women have cystic change by age 20 and about 80% of women have cystic changes after age 40.[79] LAM is sometimes revealed by chest CT in patients who present with an apparent primary spontaneous pneumothorax, but more often CT scanning is not ordered (in the United States) until recurrences occur. Progressive dyspnea on exertion without the exacerbations and remissions that are characteristic of asthma or COPD sometimes prompt a chest CT. A review of the CT by an expert familiar with LAM may increase diagnostic accuracy.[80] Chylothorax can also bring LAM to attention.\nIn some cases, a LAM diagnosis can be made with confidence on clinical grounds (without biopsy) in patients with typical cystic changes on high resolution CT scanning of the lung and findings of tuberous sclerosis, angiomyolipoma, lymphangioleiomyoma, chylothorax or serum VEGF-D > 800 pg/ml.[70][81]\nIf none of these clinical features are present, a biopsy may be necessary to make the diagnosis. Video-assisted thoracoscopic lung biopsy is the most definitive technique, but transbronchial biopsy has a yield of over 50% and can also be effective.[82][83] The safety of the latter procedure in patients with diffuse cystic disease and the profusion of cystic change that predicts an informative biopsy are incompletely understood, however. Cytology of chylous fluids, aspirated abdominal nodes or lymphatic masses can also be diagnostic.[63][84][85][86]\nDiagram 1 outlines a proposed algorithm for the diagnosis of LAM.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "An FDA-approved drug for treatment of LAM, the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus, is available for stabilization of lung function decline.[35] Lung transplantation remains the last resort for patients with advanced disease.[116]",
    "Management": "Estrogen-containing medications can exacerbate LAM[124] and are contraindicated. Agents that antagonize the effects of estrogen have not been proven to be effective for treatment, but no proper trials have been done. A trial of bronchodilators should be considered in LAM patients, because up to 17–25% have bronchodilator-responsive airflow obstruction.[5][10] Oxygen should be administered to maintain oxyhemoglobin saturations of greater than 90% with rest, exercise and sleep. Bone densitometry should be considered in all patients who are immobilized and/or on antiestrogen therapies, and appropriate therapy instituted for osteoporotic patients. Proper attention should be paid to cardiovascular health following natural or induced menopause. Immunizations for pneumococcus and influenza should be kept up to date. Pulmonary rehabilitation seems to be particularly rewarding in young, motivated patients with obstructive lung disease, but studies to assess this intervention's effect on exercise tolerance, conditioning and quality of life have not been done.[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "Lymphangiomatosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Lymphangiomatosis is a multi-system disorder. Symptoms depend on the organ system involved and, to varying degrees, the extent of the disease. Early in the course of the disease patients are usually asymptomatic, but over time the abnormally proliferating lymphatic channels that constitute lymphangiomatosis are capable of massive expansion and infiltration into surrounding tissues, bone, and organs.[2] Because of its slow course and often vague symptoms, the condition is frequently under-recognized or misdiagnosed.[8]\nEarly signs of disease in the chest include wheezing, cough, and feeling short of breath, which is often misdiagnosed as asthma.[2] The pain that accompanies bone involvement may be attributed to \"growing pains\" in younger children. With bone involvement the first indication for disease may be a pathological fracture. Symptoms may not raise concern, or even be noted, until the disease process has advanced to a point where it causes restrictive compression of vital structures. Further, the occurrence of chylous effusions seems to be unrelated to the pathologic \"burden\" of the disease, the extent of involvement in any particular tissue or organ, or the age of the patient.[9] This offers one explanation as to why, unfortunately, the appearance of chylous effusions in the chest or abdomen may be the first evidence of the disease.[citation needed]\nFollowing are some of the commonly reported symptoms of lymphangiomatosis, divided into the regions/systems in which the disease occurs:",
    "Cause": "The cause of lymphangiomatosis is not yet known. As stated earlier, it is generally considered to be the result of congenital errors of lymphatic development occurring prior to the 20th week of gestation.[2]  However, the root causes of these conditions remains unknown and further research is necessary.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "Because it is rare and has a wide spectrum of clinical, histological, and imaging features, diagnosing lymphangiomatosis can be challenging.[15] Plain x-rays reveal the presence of lytic lesions in bones, pathological fractures, interstitial infiltrates in the lungs, and chylous effusions that may be present even when there are no outward symptoms.[2][5][7]\nThe most common locations of lymphangiomatosis are the lungs and bones and one important diagnostic clue is the coexistence of lytic bone lesions and chylous effusion.[2] An isolated presentation usually carries a better prognosis than does multi-organ involvement; the combination of pleural and peritoneal involvement with chylous effusions and lytic bone lesions carries the least favorable prognosis.[16]\nWhen lung involvement is suspected, high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans may reveal a diffuse liquid-like infiltration in the mediastinal and hilar soft tissue, resulting from diffuse proliferation of lymphatic channels and accumulation of lymphatic fluid; diffuse peribronchovascular and interlobular septal thickening; ground-glass opacities; and pleural effusion.[2][17] Pulmonary function testing reveals either restrictive pattern or a mixed obstructive/restrictive pattern.[2][4]  While x-rays, HRCT scan, MRI, ultrasound, lymphangiography, bone scan, and bronchoscopy all can have a role in identifying lymphangiomatosis, biopsy remains the definitive diagnostic tool.[2][5][7][17][18][19]\nMicroscopic examination of biopsy specimens reveals an increase in both the size and number of thin walled lymphatic channels along with lymphatic spaces that are interconnecting and dilated, lined by a single attenuated layer of endothelial cells involving the dermis, subcutis, and possibly underlying fascia and skeletal muscle.[3] Additionally, Tazelaar, et al., described a pattern of histological features of lung specimens from nine patients in whom no extrathoracic lesions were identified, which they termed \"diffuse pulmonary lymphangiomatosis\" (DPL).[4]\nRecognition of the disease requires a high index of suspicion and an extensive workup. Because of its serious morbidity, lymphangiomatosis must always be considered in the differential diagnosis of lytic bone lesions accompanied by chylous effusions, in cases of primary chylopericardium, and as part of the differential diagnosis in pediatric patients presenting with signs of interstitial lung disease.[2][18][20][21]",
    "Treatment": "There is no standard approach to the treatment of lymphangiomatosis and treatment often is aimed at reducing symptoms.[2][17] Surgical intervention may be indicated when complications arise and a number of reports of response to surgical interventions, medications, and dietary approaches can be found in the medical literature.[2][16][17]\nUnfortunately, there is no standardized treatment for lymphangiomatosis and no cure.\nTreatment modalities that have been reported in the medical literature, by system, include:",

    "Disease": "Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Infants may present with feeding difficulties, with frequent vomiting, diarrhea, swelling of the abdomen, and failure to gain weight or sometimes weight loss.[2]\nAs the disease progresses in infants, increasing fat accumulation in the liver leads to other complications, including yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), and a persistent low-grade fever. An ultrasound examination shows an accumulation of chalky material (calcification) in the adrenal gland in about half of infants with LAL-D.[2][4] Complications of LAL-D progress over time, eventually leading to life-threatening problems, such as extremely low levels of circulating red blood cells (severe anemia), liver dysfunction or failure, and physical wasting (cachexia).[2]\nOlder children or adults generally present with a wide range of signs and symptoms that overlap with other disorders.[5] They may have diarrhoea, stomach pain, vomiting, or poor growth, a sign of malabsorption. They may have signs of bile-duct problems, like itchiness, jaundice, pale stool, or dark urine. Their feces may be excessively greasy. They often have an enlarged liver, liver disease, and may have yellowish deposits of fat underneath the skin, usually around their eyelids.[2][5] The disease is often undiagnosed in adults.[6] The person may have a history of premature cardiac disease or premature stroke.[2]",
    "Cause": "Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency is a genetic disease that is autosomal recessive. It is an inborn error of metabolism that causes a lysosomal storage disease.[2] The condition is caused by a mutation of the LIPA gene, which encodes the lysosomal lipase protein (also called lysosomal acid lipase or LAL), that results in a loss of the protein's normal function.[3] When LAL functions normally, it breaks down cholesteryl esters and triglycerides in low-density lipoprotein particles into free cholesterol and free fatty acids that the body can reuse; when LAL does not function, cholesteryl esters and triglycerides build up in the liver, spleen, and other organs.[2][5] The accumulation of fat in the walls of the gut and other organs in leads to serious digestive problems, including malabsorption, a condition in which the gut fails to absorb nutrients and calories from food, persistent and often forceful vomiting, frequent diarrhea, foul-smelling and fatty stools (steatorrhea), and failure to grow.[2]\nLysosomal acid lipase deficiencies occur when a person has defects (mutations) in both copies of the LIPA gene. Each parent of a person with LAL-D carries one copy of the defective LIPA gene. With every pregnancy, parents with a son or daughter affected by LAL deficiency have a one in four (25%) chance of having another affected child. A person born with defects in both LIPA genes is not able to produce adequate amounts of the LAL enzyme.[5]",
    "Diagnosis": "Blood tests may show anaemia with lipid profiles that are generally similar to people with more common familial hypercholesterolemia, including elevated total cholesterol, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and elevated serum transaminases.[2]\nLiver biopsy findings generally show a bright yellow-orange color, enlarged, lipid-laden hepatocytes and Kupffer cells, microvesicular and macrovesicular steatosis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis.[2] The only definitive tests are genetic, which may be conducted in any number of ways.[5]",

    "Management": "LAL deficiency can be treated with sebelipase alfa, a recombinant form of LAL that was approved in 2015 in the US and EU.[7][8] The disease of LAL affects < 0.2 in 10,000 people in the EU.[8] According to an estimate by a Barclays analyst, the drug will be priced at about US$375,000 per year.[8]\nIt is administered once a week via intravenous infusion in people with rapidly progressing disease in the first six months of life. In people with less aggressive disease, it is given every other week.[9]\nBefore the drug was approved, treatment of infants was mainly focused on reducing specific complications and was provided in specialized centers. Specific interventions for infants included changing from breast milk or normal bottle formula to a specialized low-fat formula, intravenous feeding, antibiotics for infections, and steroid replacement therapy because of concerns about adrenal function.[2]\nStatins were used in people with LAL-D before the approval of sebelipase alfa; they helped control cholesterol, but did not appear to slow liver damage; liver transplantation was necessary for most patients.[2]"

Symptoms can begin in early adolescence and they get worse over time. Eventually, MJD leads to paralysis; however, intellectual functions usually remain the same.[citation needed]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "MJD can be diagnosed by recognizing the symptoms of the disease and by taking a family history.  Physicians ask patients questions about the kind of symptoms relatives with the disease had, the progression and harshness of symptoms, and the ages of onset in family members.[citation needed]\nPresymptomatic diagnosis of MJD can be made with a genetic test.[17] The direct detection of the genetic mutation responsible for MJD has been available since 1995.[18] Genetic testing looks at the number of CAG repeats within the coding region of the MJD/ATXN3 gene on chromosome 14. The test will show positive for MJD if this region contains 61–87 repeats, as opposed to the 12–44 repeats found in healthy individuals. A limitation to this test is that if the number of CAG repeats in an individual being tested falls between the healthy and pathogenic ranges (45–60 repeats), then the test cannot predict whether an individual will have MJD symptoms.[17]",
    "Treatment": "There is no cure for Machado-Joseph Disease.  However, treatments are available for some symptoms.[1][3]  For example, spasticity can be reduced with antispasmodic drugs, such as baclofen.  The Parkinsonian symptoms can be treated with levodopa therapy. Prism glasses can reduce diplopic symptoms.[3] Physiotherapy/Physical Therapy and/or occupational therapy can help patients by prescribing mobility aids to increase the patients' independence, providing gait training, and prescribing exercises to maintain the mobility of various joints and general health to decrease the likelihood of falls or injuries as a result of falls. Walkers and wheelchairs can greatly help the patient with everyday tasks. Some patients will experience difficulties with speech and swallowing, therefore a Speech-Language Pathologist can assist the patients to improve their communicating abilities and their issues with swallowing.[3]\nSome experimental treatments using trehalose have been suggested. In 2021, the FDA accepted an Investigational New Drug (IND) application and granted fast track status for an injectable form of trehalose (SLS-005) as a potential treatment for spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3).[19][20]",

    "Disease": "Macrocephaly-capillary malformation",
    "Signs and symptoms": "N/A",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is usually based on clinical observation. Various sets of criteria have been suggested to identify the disorder in an individual patient, all of which include macrocephaly and a number of the following: somatic overgrowth, cutis marmorata, midline facial birthmark, polydactyly/syndactyly, asymmetry (hemihyperplasia or hemihypertrophy), hypotonia at birth, developmental delay, connective tissue defect and frontal bossing.[5][6] Currently no consensus exists about which diagnostic criteria are definitive and so evaluation by a medical geneticist or other clinician with familiarity with the syndrome is usually needed to provide diagnostic certainty. It is not clear if there are some features which are mandatory to make the diagnosis, but macrocephaly appears essentially universal though may not be congenital. The distinctive vascular abnormalities of the skin often fade over time, making the diagnosis challenging in older children with this condition.[citation needed]\nThe brain can be affected in several ways in this syndrome. Some children are born with structural brain anomalies such as cortical dysplasia or polymicrogyria. While developmental delay is nearly universal in this syndrome it is variable in severity, with the majority having mild to moderate delays and a minority having severe cognitive impairment. Some patients are affected with a seizure disorder. White matter abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), suggesting a delay in white matter myelination, is commonly seen in early childhood. Some patients may have asymmetry of the brain, with one side being noticeably larger than the other.[citation needed]\nOne interesting phenomenon that seems very common in this syndrome is the tendency for disproportionate brain growth in the first few years of life, with crossing of percentiles on the head circumference growth charts. A consequence of this disproportionate brain growth appears to be a significantly increased risk of cerebellar tonsillar herniation (descent of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum of the skull, resembling a Chiari I malformation neuroradiologically) and ventriculomegaly/hydrocephalus.[7] Such cerebellar tonsil herniation may occur in up to 70% of children with M-CM.[citation needed]\nThe medical literature suggests that there is a risk of cardiac arrhythmias in early childhood.[8][9] The cause for this is unknown. In addition, a variety of different congenital cardiac malformations have been reported in a small number of patients with this disorder.[10][11]\nLike other syndromes associated with disproportionate growth, there appears to be a slightly increased risk of certain types of childhood malignancies in M-CM (such as Wilms' tumor). However, the precise incidence of these malignancies is unclear.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "There is no cure for this condition. Treatment is supportive and varies depending on how symptoms present and their severity. Some degree of developmental delay is expected in almost all cases of M-CM, so evaluation for early intervention or special education programs is appropriate. Rare cases have been reported with no discernible delay in academic or school abilities.[citation needed]\nPhysical therapy and orthopedic bracing can help young children with gross motor development. Occupational therapy or speech therapy may also assist with developmental delays. Attention from an orthopedic surgeon may be required for leg length discrepancy due to hemihyperplasia.[citation needed]\nChildren with hemihyperplasia are thought to have an elevated risk for certain types of cancers. Recently published management guidelines recommend regular abdominal ultrasounds up to age eight to detect Wilms' tumor. AFP testing to detect liver cancer is not recommended as there have been no reported cases of hepatoblastoma in M-CM patients.[1]\nCongenital abnormalities in the brain and progressive brain overgrowth can result in a variety of neurological problems that may require intervention. These include hydrocephalus, cerebellar tonsillar herniation (Chiari I), seizures and syringomyelia. These complications are not usually congenital, they develop over time often presenting complications in late infancy or early childhood, though they can become problems even later. Baseline brain and spinal cord MRI imaging with repeat scans at regular intervals is often prescribed to monitor the changes that result from progressive brain overgrowth.\nAssessment of cardiac health with echocardiogram and EKG may be prescribed and arrhythmias or abnormalities may require surgical treatment.[citation needed]",

FVH2 occurs by autosomal recessive inheritance.[8] Both parents pass the mutated gene to the child.[8] Macular hypoplasia prevails due to improper placement of the optic nerve.[8]",

    "Signs and symptoms": "The typical signs of malignant hyperthermia are due to a hypercatabolic state, which presents as a very high temperature, an increased heart rate and abnormally rapid breathing, increased carbon dioxide production, increased oxygen consumption, mixed acidosis, rigid muscles, and rhabdomyolysis.[5] These signs can develop any time during the administration of the anesthetic triggering agents. Rarely, signs may develop up to 40 minutes after the end of anaesthesia.[6]",
    "Cause": "Malignant hyperthermia is a disorder that can be considered a gene–environment interaction. In most people with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility, they have few or no symptoms unless they are exposed to a triggering agent. The most common triggering agents are volatile anesthetic gases, such as halothane, sevoflurane, desflurane, isoflurane, enflurane or the depolarizing muscle relaxants suxamethonium and decamethonium used primarily in general anesthesia.[5] In rare cases, the biological stresses of physical exercise or heat may be the trigger.[5][7] In fact, malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS), predisposed by mutations in the skeletal muscle calcium release channel (RYR1), is one of the most severe heat-related illnesses. The MHS-associated heat susceptibilities predominantly affect children and metabolically active young adults, often leading to life- threatening hypermetabolic responses to heat.[8]\nOther anesthetic drugs do not trigger malignant hyperthermia. Some examples of drugs that don't cause MH include local anesthetics (lidocaine, bupivacaine, mepivacaine), opiates (morphine, fentanyl), ketamine, barbiturates, nitrous oxide, propofol, etomidate, and benzodiazepines. The nondepolarizing muscle relaxants pancuronium, cisatracurium, atracurium, mivacurium, vecuronium and rocuronium also are generally thought to be safe for patients MH.[9]\nThere is mounting evidence that some individuals with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility may develop MH with exercise and/or on exposure to hot environments.[10]",

    "Treatment": "The current treatment of choice is the intravenous administration of dantrolene, the only known antidote, discontinuation of triggering agents, and supportive therapy directed at correcting hyperthermia, acidosis, and organ dysfunction.

Patients (especially the ones with the difference that was mentioned beforehand) have a higher risk of having anomalies in the ear canal, the auditory ossicles, or semicircular canals. These abnormalities (with the exception of the preauricular tags) end up in hearing loss in some to most cases.[4]\nThere are also oral and respiratory anomalies present within the condition, cleft palates and choanal atresia aren't uncommon findings. Choanal atresia in particular can end up causing breathing difficulties to the patient.[4]\nOccasional findings include short stature, heart and thumb defects, esophageal atresia, and tracheoesophageal fistula. These last two symptoms are highly fatal, and may end up in premature death if left untreated.[4]",
    "Cause": "This condition is caused by inherited autosomal recessive mutations in the EFTUD2 gene. These mutations can either be missense, splice-site, or the result of a microdeletion.[6] This gene is essential for the formation of spliceosomes, which helps in producing and maturing messenger RNA.

    "Disease": "Maple syrup urine disease",

Metabolic crises can be life-threatening and should be treated immediately.[4]",
    "Cause": "Mutations in the following genes cause maple syrup urine disease:\n• BCKDHA (OMIM: 608348)\n• BCKDHB (OMIM: 248611)\n• DBT (OMIM: 248610)\n• DLD (OMIM: 238331)\nThese four genes produce proteins that work together as the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex. The complex is essential for breaking down the amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine. These are present in some quantity in almost all kinds of food, but in particular, protein-rich foods such as dairy products, meat, fish, soy, gluten, eggs, nuts, whole grains, seeds, avocados, algae, edible seaweed, beans, and pulses. Mutation in any of these genes reduces or eliminates the function of the enzyme complex, preventing the normal breakdown of isoleucine, leucine, and valine. As a result, these amino acids and their by-products build up in the body. Because high levels of these substances are toxic to the brain and other organs, this accumulation leads to the serious medical problems associated with maple syrup urine disease.[citation needed]\nThis condition has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, which means the defective gene is located on an autosome, and two copies of the gene – one from each parent – must be inherited to be affected by the disorder. The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are carriers of one copy of the defective gene, but are usually unaffected by the disorder.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "Initially, the diagnosis was commonly made based on suggestive symptoms and odor, the odor coming from the compound sotolon (sometimes spelled sotolone).[3] These days, affected individuals are now often identified by characteristic elevations on plasma amino acid which do not have the characteristic odor.[10]",

    "Disease": "Menkes disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Affected infants may be born prematurely. Signs of the disease appear during infancy, typically after a two- to three-month period of normal or slightly slowed development that is followed by a loss of early developmental skills and subsequent developmental delay. Patients exhibit hypotonia (weak muscle tone), failure to thrive, hypothermia (subnormal body temperature), sagging facial features, seizures, and metaphyseal widening. Hair appears strikingly peculiar: kinky, colorless or silvery, and brittle. There can be extensive neurodegeneration in the gray matter of the brain.[8] Arteries in the brain can also be twisted with frayed and split inner walls. This can lead to rupture or blockage of the arteries. Weakened bones (osteoporosis) may result in fractures.[9]\nOccipital horn syndrome (sometimes called X-linked cutis laxa and previously called Ehlers-Danlos type 9[10]) is a mild form of Menkes syndrome that begins in early to middle childhood. It is characterized by calcium deposits in a bone at the base of the skull (occipital bone), coarse hair, and loose skin and joints.[11]",
    "Cause": "Mutations in the ATP7A gene, located on chromosome Xq21.1,[12] lead to Menkes syndrome.[13] This condition is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern.[14] About 30% of MNK cases are due to new mutations and 70% are inherited, almost always from the mother.[7] Even though the disease is more common in males, females can still be a carrier of the disease. As the result of a mutation in the ATP7A gene, copper is poorly distributed to cells in the body. Copper accumulates in some tissues, such as the small intestine and kidneys, while the brain and other tissues have unusually low levels. The decreased supply of copper can reduce the activity of numerous copper-containing enzymes that are necessary for the structure and function of bone, skin, hair, blood vessels and the nervous system such as lysyl oxidase.[15] As with other X-linked disorders, female children of a carrier mother have an even chance of carrying the disorder, but are normally well; male children have an even chance of having the disorder or of being free from it. A genetic counselor may have useful advice.[9]",
    "Diagnosis": "Menkes syndrome can be diagnosed by blood tests of the copper and ceruloplasmin levels, skin biopsy, and optical microscopic examination of the hair to view characteristic Menkes abnormalities. X-rays of the skull and skeleton are conducted to look for abnormalities in bone formation.[7] Urine homovanillic acid/vanillylmandelic acid ratio has been proposed as a screening tool to support earlier detection.[18][19] Since 70% of MNK cases are inherited, genetic testing of the mother can be performed to search for a mutation in the ATP7A gene.[20]",
    "Treatment": "There is no cure for Menkes disease. Early treatment with injections of copper supplements (acetate or glycinate) may be of some slight benefit. 11 of 12 newborns who were diagnosed with MNK were alive at age 4.6.[21] Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive.

Diagnosis can be made based on clinical observations and radiographic findings as well as family history.[12] Using radiographic methods, osteochondromas can be seen at the metaphyses of the short tubular bones, such as those in the hands and feet, pointing towards the joints.[6] Enchondromas would also be visible along with the osteochondromas. The differential diagnosis includes hereditary multiple osteochondromas. This is a condition in which the long bones are primarily affected, and the lesions point away from the joint or growth plate. This may also result in the shortening or deformity of the affected bones.[6] Since metachondromatosis is hereditary, genetic counseling can be offered to patients and their families. Some available genetic tests for metachondromatosis are sequence analysis of the entire coding region, targeted variant analysis, deletion/duplication analysis, and a sequence analysis of select exons associated with the disorder.[13]",
    "Treatment": "Osteochondromas are usually painless, and in many cases, they spontaneously regress after the first or second decade of life.

    "Disease": "Metachromatic leukodystrophy",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Like many other genetic disorders that affect lipid metabolism, there are several forms of MLD, which are late infantile, juvenile, and adult.[citation needed]\n• In the late infantile form, which is the most common form of MLD (50–60%), affected children begin having difficulty walking after the first year of life, usually at 15–24 months. Symptoms include muscle wasting and weakness, muscle rigidity, developmental delays, progressive loss of vision leading to blindness, convulsions, impaired swallowing, paralysis, and dementia. Children may become comatose. Untreated, most children with this form of MLD die by age 5, often much sooner.\n• Children with the juvenile form of MLD (onset between 3 and 10 years of age) usually begin with impaired school performance, mental deterioration, and dementia, then develop symptoms similar to the late infantile form but with slower progression. Age of death is variable, but normally within 10 to 15 years of symptom onset. Some patients can live for several decades after onset. A recent trend is to try to distinguish early-juvenile (ages 3–7) and late-juvenile forms of the disease. Generally, early-juveniles have motor skill declines as their first symptoms while late-juveniles show cognitive declines first.\n• The adult form commonly begins after age 16 often with an onset in the 4th or 5th decade of life and presents as a psychiatric disorder or progressive dementia. Adult-onset MLD usually progresses more slowly than the late infantile and juvenile forms, with a protracted course of a decade or more.\nPalliative care can help with many of the symptoms and usually improves the quality of life and longevity.[citation needed]\nCarriers have low enzyme levels compared to their family population (\"normal\" levels vary from family to family) but even low enzyme levels are adequate to process the body's sulfatide.[citation needed]",
    "Cause": "MLD is directly caused by a deficiency of the enzyme arylsulfatase A[3] (ARSA) and is characterized by enzyme activity in leukocytes that is less than 10% of normal controls.[4] However, assay of the ARSA enzyme activity alone is not sufficient for diagnosis; ARSA pseudodeficiency, which is characterized by enzyme activity that is 5~20% of normal controls does not cause MLD.[4] Without this enzyme, sulfatides build up in many tissues of the body, eventually destroying the myelin sheath of the nervous system. The myelin sheath is a fatty covering that protects nerve fibers. Without it, the nerves in the brain (central nervous system – CNS) and the peripheral nerves (peripheral nervous system – PNS) which control, among other things the muscles related to mobility, cease to function properly.[citation needed]\nArylsulfatase A is activated by saposin B (Sap B), a non-enzymatic proteinaceous cofactor.[5]  When the arylsulfatase A enzyme level is normal but the sulfatides are still high – meaning that they are not being broken down because the enzyme is not activated – the resulting disease is saposin B deficiency, which presents similar to MLD.[4] Saposin B deficiency is very rare, much more rare than traditional MLD.[4] The enzyme that is present is not \"enabled\" to a normal level of efficiency and can't break down the sulfatides which results in all of the same MLD symptoms and progression.[6]\nA 2011 study contended sulfatide is not completely responsible for MLD because it is non-toxic. It has been suggested that lysosulfatide, sulfatide which has had its acyl group removed, plays a role because of its cytotoxic properties in vitro.[7]",
    "Diagnosis": "Clinical examination and MRI are often the first steps in an MLD diagnosis.  MRI can be indicative of MLD but is not adequate as a confirming test. An ARSA-A enzyme level blood test with a confirming urinary sulfatide test is the best biochemical test for MLD. Urinary sulfatide is important to distinguish between MLD and pseudo-MLD blood results. Genomic sequencing may also confirm MLD, however, there are likely more mutations than the over 200 already known to cause MLD that are not yet ascribed to MLD that cause MLD so in those cases a biochemical test is still warranted.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "There is currently no approved treatment for MLD in symptomatic late infantile patients or for juvenile and adult-onset with advanced symptoms. There is a treatment for pre-symptomatic patients and certain others with the condition.\nSymptomatic patients typically receive clinical treatment focused on pain and symptom management.[citation needed]Pre-symptomatic late infantile MLD patients, as well as those with juvenile or adult MLD that are either presymptomatic or displaying mild symptoms, can consider bone marrow transplantation (including stem cell transplantation), which may slow down the progression of the disease in the central nervous system.[citation needed] However, results in the peripheral nervous system have been less dramatic, and the long-term results of these therapies have been mixed.[citation needed]\nIn 2020 the European Medical Agency approved the cell therapy drug atidarsagene autotemcel (Libmeldy) for the treatment of infantile and juvenile forms of metachromatic leukodystrophy in Europe.[11] In 2024 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved atidarsagene autotemcel (Lenmeldy) for use with pre-symptomatic late infantile, pre-symptomatic early juvenile or early symptomatic juvenile metachromatic leukodystrophy.[12]\nPresymptomatic patients can be cured with one treatment of atidarsagene autotemcel, which is a type of advanced medicine called a ‘gene therapy’. This type of medicine works by delivering genes into the body. The active substance in atidarsagene autotemcel is CD34+ stem cells. They are retrieved from the patient's own bone marrow or blood. They are then modified to contain a copy of the gene to make functional ARSA. After confirming that the cells contain an active copy of the gene, they are injected into the patient's bone marrow. CD34+ cells can divide to produce other sorts of blood cells.[11]",

    "Cause": "Pyle disease is caused by mutations in the SFRP4 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that blocks (inhibits) a process called Wnt signaling, which is involved in the development of several tissues and organs throughout the body. In particular, regulation of Wnt signaling by the SFRP4 protein is critical for normal bone development and remodeling. Bone remodeling is a normal process in which old bone is broken down and new bone is created to replace it. Mutations in the SFRP4 gene are thought to prevent the production of functional SFRP4 protein. The resulting dysregulation of Wnt signaling leads to the bone abnormalities characteristic of Pyle disease.[3]\nPyle disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the SFRP4 gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene. While they do not develop the condition, they may have mild abnormalities of the long bones.[5][3]",

    "Disease": "Microphthalmia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "N/A",
    "Cause": "It has been postulated that microphthalmia arises as a result of interference with postnatal eye growth, in contrast to anophthalmia which originates much earlier during fetal development.\nGenetic causes of microphthalmia include chromosomal abnormalities (e.g. Patau syndrome, mosaic trisomy 9, 13q deletion syndrome, Wolf–Hirschhorn syndrome) or monogenetic Mendelian disorders (e.g. CHARGE syndrome, Fraser syndrome, oculofaciocardiodental syndrome, Lenz microphthalmia syndrome).[3][7]\nMicrophthalmia in newborns is sometimes associated with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder[2] or infections during pregnancy, particularly herpes simplex virus, rubella and cytomegalovirus (CMV), but the evidence is inconclusive.[3]\nThe following genes, many of which are transcription and regulatory factors, have been implicated in microphthalmia, anophthalmia, and coloboma:[8][9][10]\nSOX2 has been implicated in a substantial number (10–15%) of cases and in many other cases failure to develop the ocular lens often results in microphthalmia.[3]\nMicrophthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), located on chromosome 14q32, is associated with one form of isolated microphthalmia (MCOP1). In mammals, the failure of expression of MITF in the retinal pigment epithelium prevents this structure from fully differentiating, causing a malformation of the choroid fissure of the eye and drainage of vitreous body fluid. Without this fluid, the eye fails to enlarge, resulting in microphthalmia. Waardenburg syndrome type 2 in humans may also be caused by mutations in MITF[11] The human MITF gene is homologous to the mouse microphthalmia gene (gene symbol mi); mouse with mutations in this gene are hypopigmented in their fur. The identification of the genetics of WS type 2 owes a lot to observations of phenotypes of MITF-mutant mice.[11]",
    "Diagnosis": "Microphthalmia is often diagnosed soon after birth. An initial diagnosis usually occurs after the eyes are inspected through the lids.[3] In addition to visual examinations, measurements of the cornea are used in the diagnosis of this condition.[3] An ultrasound may also be conducted to confirm whether the axial length of the eye is clinically below average (i.e. at least 2 standard deviations below the age-adjusted mean).[3][5]\nWhen a case of microphthalmia is detected, the patient should visit an eye specialist as soon as possible. It is important for an ophthalmologist to conduct a thorough examination within 2 weeks after birth.[13] The ophthalmologist will confirm the preliminary diagnosis and look for signs of other anomalies in both eyes. These abnormalities may include coloboma, optic nerve hypoplasia, retinal dystrophy, and cataract.[13] Ultrasound may also be used to determine the presence of any internal eye issues, which may not otherwise be visible.[13] It is possible for individuals with microphthalmia to have some vision in the affected eye(s). For this reason, the vision of infants with microphthalmia should be evaluated early on, even in severe cases.[13] Pediatric vision tests along with electrodiagnostics are typically used to assess visual acuity.[13]\nIf no related symptoms are present, microphthalmia is defined as non-syndromic or isolated microphthalmia (MCOP). When occurring in conjunction with other developmental defects, it may be diagnosed as syndromic microphthalmia (MCOPS). Approximately 60 to 80% of microphthalmia cases are syndromic.[14] Several types of MCOPS have been recognized based on their genetic causes:",
    "Treatment": "Microphthalmia cannot be cured. However, there are treatments options to manage the condition and its associated symptoms. When the affected eye(s) display some visual function, a patient's eyesight can be improved (sometimes up to good state) by plus lenses, as a small eye is usually far-sighted.[13] When one of the eyes is unaffected, caution should be taken to guard this 'good' eye and preserve its vision. In these unilateral cases, eye glasses may be worn to offer a measure of physical protection.[3][13]\nA key aspect of managing this condition is accounting for the small volume of the eye. The small orbit size characteristic of microphthalmia can impact the growth and structural development of the face after birth. As a result, microphthalmia can cause hemifacial asymmetry.[3][13] This possibility is a particular concern for individuals with unilateral cases of microphthalmia. With one eye of average size, the asymmetry often becomes much more severe as the child ages.[13] An axial length of less than 16 mm (0.63 in) indicates that a microphthalmic eye's growth will not be sufficient, and intervention will be necessary to reduce the degree of facial asymmetry.[13]\nMinimizing facial asymmetry is important for cosmetic and structural reasons.[3][5][13] In order to address the size discrepancy of the affected eye(s), it is important to begin eye socket expansion early in life. The face reaches 70% of its adult size by roughly 2 years of age, and 90% of its adult size by about 5.5 years of age.[13] Additionally, the symmetry fostered by early socket expansion allows for a better prosthetic fit later in life.[5][13] Typically, an infant begins wearing a conformer, or an unpainted ocular prosthesis, in the first weeks of life.[3][5][13] The conformer is repeatedly replaced with a prothesis of a slightly larger size. This process, which takes place during the first 5 years of life, gradually enlarges the eye socket.[3][5][13] Socket expansion through the use of implants of increasing size is another effective strategy.[3][13]\nAfter socket expansion is complete, a painted prosthetic eye can be worn for cosmetic reasons.[13] If the microphthalmic eye has functional vision, an affected individual may opt against wearing a painted prothesis. Lenses are also sometimes used for cosmetic purposes, such as a plus lens to enlarge the microphthalmic eye.[13]",

    "Signs and symptoms": "N/A",
    "Cause": "MDS is a microdeletion syndrome involving loss of the gene PAFAH1B1 on chromosome 17 which is responsible for the syndrome's characteristic sign of lissencephaly. The loss of another gene, YWHAE, in the same region of chromosome 17 increases the severity of the lissencephaly in patients with Miller–Dieker syndrome. Additional genes in the deleted region are likely to contribute to the varied features of Miller–Dieker syndrome.[4]\nIt may be a random event during the formation of reproductive cells or in early fetal development or due to familial chromosomal rearrangement called chromosomal translocation. In less than 20% of cases an unaffected parent carries a particular chromosomal rearrangement called a balanced translocation, in which no genetic material is gained or lost. Increased rate of unexplained fetal loss may be observed in those who have these suspectible balanced translocations although they may be otherwise asymptomatic.[5] However, these translocations can become also unbalanced as they are passed to the next generation. Miller–Dieker syndrome is usually not inherited. The deletion event occurs randomly during gametogenesis (formation of eggs or sperm) or in early foetal development.[citation needed] Therefore, no history of the disorder is usually seen in their families.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "The disease may be diagnosed by cytogenetic techniques like fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), testing for a microdeletion at LIS1.[6]",
    "Treatment": "While no cure for MDS is available yet, many complications associated with this condition can be treated, and a great deal can be done to support or compensate for functional disabilities. Because of the diversity of the symptoms, it can be necessary to see a number of different specialists and undergo various examinations, including:[citation needed]\n• Developmental evaluation\n• Cardiologists evaluation\n• Otolaryngology\n• Treatment of seizures\n• Urologic evaluation\n• Genetic counseling: though MDS is usually random and without a family history, a balanced chromosomal translocation in one of the parents can greatly raise the chances of a child of theirs being affected. If parents with an affected child are planning another pregnancy, they are usually advised to visit a genetic counselor for further information.\nThis disease is fairly uncommon, and treatment is scarce.",

Those with biallelic loss of function who don't have any functional SDH have an average age of onset of 8.6 ± 7.9 months, while those with monoallelic loss of function have an average age of onset of 21.5 ± 20.3 years.[1] In the biallelic form, there is typically a Leigh syndrome phenotype with symptoms including seizures, white matter lesions, nystagmus, developmental delay, microcephaly, leukodystrophy, hypertonia, multiorgan failure, spasticity, tetraparesis, and more. In the monallelic form, often caused by heterozygous mutations of SDHA, symptoms include exercise intolerance, rhabdomyolosis, muscle pain, dyspnea, hypertension, dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and optic atrophy.[1]",

Gastrointestinal symptoms may include gastrointestinal dysmotility, due to inefficient peristalsis, which may result in pseudo-obstruction and cause malabsorption of nutrients.[2][5] Additionally, gastrointestinal symptoms such as borborygmi, early satiety, diarrhea, constipation, gastroparesis, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and diverticulitis may be present in MNGIE patients.[2] Neurological symptoms may include diffuse leukoencephalopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and myopathy.[2] Ocular symptoms may include retinal degeneration, ophthalmoplegia, and ptosis.[2][5] Those with MNGIE are often thin and experience continuous weight loss. The characteristic thinness of MNGIE patients is caused by multiple factors including inadequate caloric intake due to gastrointestinal symptoms and discomfort, malabsorption of food from bacterial overgrowth due to decreased motility, as well as an increased metabolic demand due to inefficient production of ATP by the mitochondria.[citation needed]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "While the disease manifests early in life in most cases, diagnosis of the disease is often quite delayed.[2][4][5] The symptoms that affected patients present vary, but the most common presenting symptoms are gastrointestinal issues such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, and neurologic or ocular symptoms such as hearing loss, weakness, and peripheral neuropathy.[4] These gastrointestinal symptoms cause patients with MNGIE to be very thin and experience persistent weight loss and this often leads to MNGIE being misdiagnosed as an eating disorder.[2] These symptoms without presentation of disordered eating and warped body image warrant further investigation into the possibility of MNGIE as a diagnosis.[2] Presentation of these symptoms and lack of disordered eating are not enough for a diagnosis. Radiologic studies showing hypoperistalsis, large atonic stomach, dilated duodenum, diverticula, and white matter changes are required to confirm the diagnosis.[4] Elevated blood and urine nucleoside levels are also indicative of MNGIE syndrome.[2] Abnormal nerve conduction as well as analysis of mitochondria from liver, intestines, muscle, and nerve tissue can also be used to support the diagnosis.[2][4]",

People with disseminated infection in the brain can develop changes in mental status or lapse into a coma.[28][29]",
    "Cause": "Mucormycosis is a fungal infection caused by fungi in the order Mucorales.[5] In most cases it is due to an invasion of the genera Rhizopus and Mucor, common bread molds.[30] Most fatal infections are caused by Rhizopus oryzae.[18] It is less likely due to Lichtheimia, and rarely due to Apophysomyces.[31] Others include Cunninghamella, Mortierella, and Saksenaea.[5][32]\nThe fungal spores are present in the environment. They can be found on items such as moldy bread and fruit, and are breathed in frequently, but cause disease only in some people.[5] In addition to being breathed in and deposited in the nose, sinuses, and lungs, the spores can also enter the skin via blood or directly through a cut or open wound, and can also grow in the intestine if eaten.[15][32] Once deposited, the fungus grows branch-like filaments which invade blood vessels, causing clots to form and surrounding tissues to die.[5] Other reported causes include contaminated wound dressings.[5] Mucormycosis has been reported following the use of elastoplast and the use of tongue depressors for holding in place intravenous catheters.[5] Outbreaks have also been linked to hospital bed sheets, negative-pressure rooms, water leaks, poor ventilation, contaminated medical equipment, and building works.[33] One hypothesis suggests that the spread of fungal spores in India could be due to fumes generated from the burning of Mucorales-rich biomass, like cow dung and crop stubble.[34]",
    "Diagnosis": "No blood test can confirm the diagnosis.[38] Diagnosis requires identifying the mold in the affected tissue by biopsy and confirming it with a fungal culture.[8] Because the causative fungi occur all around and may therefore contaminate cultures underway, a culture alone is not decisive.[5] Tests may also include culture and direct detection of the fungus in lung fluid, blood, serum, plasma, and urine.[21] Blood tests include a complete blood count to look specifically for neutropenia.[38] Other blood tests include iron levels, blood glucose, bicarbonate, and electrolytes.[38] Endoscopic examination of the nasal passages may be needed.[38]",

However, surgery is not always necessary or appropriate.[20]\nSports involving joint overload are to be avoided, while swimming or cycling are strongly suggested.[21] Cycling has to be avoided in people having ligamentous laxity.\nWeight control is suggested.[22] [citation needed]\nThe use of crutches, other deambulatory aids or wheelchair is useful to prevent hip pain.[23] Pain in the hand while writing can be avoided using a pen with wide grip.[24]",

    "Disease": "Multiple sulfatase deficiency",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of this disorder commonly appear between one and two years of age. Signs include mildly coarsened facial features, deafness, ichthyosis[7] and an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly).[8]  Abnormalities of the skeleton, such as a curving of the spine and breast bone may occur. Individuals afflicted with this disorder typically have dry skin.[9] Children affected by this disorder develop more slowly than normal and may display delayed speech and walking skills.[9]\nThe disease is fatal, with symptoms that include neurological damage and severe intellectual disability.[10] These sulfatase enzymes are responsible for breaking down and recycling complex sulfate-containing sugars from lipids and mucopolysaccharides within the lysosome. The accumulation of lipids and mucopolysaccharides inside the lysosome results in symptoms associated with this disorder. As of 2018[update], 75–100 cases of MSD had been reported worldwide.[9]",
    "Cause": "Multiple sulfatase deficiency is caused by any mutation of the SUMF1 gene which renders its protein product, the formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE), defective.[11][12] These mutations result in inactive forms of FGE.[13] This enzyme is required for posttranslational modification of a cysteine residue in the sulfatase enzyme active site into formylglycine,[14] which is required for its proper function.[15]",
    "Diagnosis": "MSD may be diagnosed when deficiency of more than one sulfatase enzyme is identified in leukocytes or fibroblasts,[16] or by molecular genetic testing which shows pathogenic variation in both alleles of the SUMF1 gene.[9]",
    "Treatment": "As there is no cure for MSD, treatment is restricted to the management of symptoms.[16]\nThere is much research on MSD that is currently underway. MSD Action Foundation has initiated more than 15 research projects on MSD in the last 6 years. Many of these have a translational focus.

    "Cause": "Musical hallucinations can occur in people who are physically and mentally healthy, and for them, there is no known cause.[7] Most people find their musical hallucinations obtrusive, and wish to be rid of them, while others welcome them. In addition, investigators have pointed to factors that are associated with musical hallucinations. Evers and Ellgers compiled a significant portion of musical hallucination articles, case studies etc. and were able to categorize five major etiologies:\n• Hypoacusis\n• Psychiatric disorders\n• Focal brain lesion\n• Epilepsy\n• Intoxication",
    "Diagnosis": "N/A",
    "Treatment": "To date, there is no successful method of treatment that \"cures\" musical hallucinations. There have been successful therapies in single cases that have ameliorated the hallucinations. Some of these successes include drugs such as neuroleptics, antidepressants, and certain anticonvulsive drugs. A musical hallucination was alleviated, for example, by antidepressant medications given to patients with depression.[3] Sanchez reported that some authors have suggested that the use of hearing aids may improve musical hallucination symptoms.[9] They believed that the external environment influences the auditory hallucinations, showing worsening of symptoms in quieter environments than in noisier ones.[8][17][18] Oliver Sacks' patient, Mrs. O'C, reported being in an \"ocean of sound\" despite being in a quiet room due to a small thrombosis or infarction in her right temporal lobe. After treatment, Mrs. O'C was relinquished of her musical experience but said that, \"I do miss the old songs. Now, with lots of them, I can't even recall them. It was like being given back a forgotten bit of my childhood again.\" Sacks also reported another elderly woman, Mrs. O'M, who had a mild case of deafness and reported hearing musical pieces. When she was treated with anticonvulsive medications, her musical hallucinations ceased but when asked if she missed them, she said \"Not on your life.\"[19]\nResearchers found that patients with musical hallucinations respond well to the drug Donepezil, making it another potential treatment for the condition. Donepezil, which belongs to a class of medication called acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, is most commonly used to treat dementia in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Although it cannot cure Alzheimer's, it can provide patients with a better quality of life by inhibiting the loss of function and improving the ability to think.[20] For patients with musical hallucinations, the medication keeps them more aware and stimulated to control the onset symptoms of hallucinations. Overall, with few adverse effects, research has found that donepezil is an effective and safe choice of treatment.[21]",

    "Management": "Since myositis ossificians is more common in those with bleeding disorders, the formation of bone in soft tissue is thought to be associated with haematoma formation. As the calcifications will typically resolve after a period of time, non-surgical treatment is encouraged to minimize the unpleasant symptoms and maximize the function of the affected limb.[5]\nFollowing a skeletal muscle injury, the affected limb should be immobilized with bed rest, ice therapy, compression, and elevation of the affected limb. Crutches can be used for ambulation while providing adequate rest for the affected limb and minimizing the haematoma formation. Ice therapy for 15 to 20 minutes every 30 to 60 minutes is useful to reduce the skeletal muscle blood flow by 50%. Aggressive limb physiotherapy is not recommended at this stage to prevent the worsening of symptoms. After 48 to 72 hours, range of motion exercise can be introduced as long as the range of motion is not painful. If the lesion becomes more mature, active range of motion and resistance strengthening exercises are useful in maintaining joint function.[5]\nSurgical excision is reserved for those who failed the non-surgical treatment, those with intolerable pain, compression of the neurovascular structures, or limitation of the range of motion of the joint which affects the activities of daily living. Surgery is only performed after 6 to 18 months following injury because surgery does not alter the bone maturation process. If a surgery is performed too early, it may predispose to recurrence. However, the optimum timing for surgery and the rate of recurrence following early surgery is controversial because some studies have shown that early surgery does reduce the rate of recurrence.[5]\nFor those who had total hip replacement or total hip arthroplasty, postoperative single low-dose radiation with three weeks of oral indomethacin regimen will be preventive  for heterotopic ossification.[13][14] Radiation therapy is also effective in preventing recurrence in those who had done operative excision of heterotopic ossification of the elbow.[15]"

    "Disease": "Myotonia congenita",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The prolonged muscle contractions, which occur most commonly in the leg muscles in recessive mutations, and more commonly in the hands, face, and eyelids in dominant mutations,[2] are often enhanced by inactivity, and in some forms are relieved by repetitive movement known as \"the warm-up effect\". This effect often diminishes quickly with rest. Some individuals with myotonia congenita are prone to falling as a result of hasty movements or an inability to stabilize themselves after a loss of balance. During a fall, a person with myotonia congenita may experience partial or complete rigid paralysis that will quickly resolve once the event is over. However, a fall into cold water may render the person unable to move for the duration of submergence. As with myotonic goats, children are more prone to falling than adults, due to their impulsivity.[citation needed]\nThe two major types of myotonia congenita are distinguished by the severity of their symptoms and their patterns of inheritance. Becker disease usually appears later in childhood than Thomsen disease, and causes more severe myotonia, muscle stiffness and transient weakness.[3] Although myotonia in itself is not normally associated with pain, cramps or myalgia may develop.[3] People with Becker disease often experience temporary attacks of muscle weakness, particularly in the arms and hands, brought on by movement after periods of rest. They may also develop mild, permanent muscle weakness over time.[4] This muscle weakness is not observed in people with Thomsen disease. However, in recent times, as more of the individual mutations that cause myotonia congenita are identified, these limited disease classifications are becoming less widely used.[citation needed]\nEarly symptoms in a child may include:[citation needed]\n• Difficulty swallowing\n• Gagging\n• Stiff movements that improve when they are repeated\n• Frequent falling\n• Difficulties opening eyelids after strenuous contraction or crying (von Graefe's sign)[5]\nPossible complications may include:[citation needed]\n• Aspiration pneumonia (caused by swallowing difficulties)\n• Frequent choking or gagging in infants (also caused by swallowing difficulties)\n• Abdominal muscle weakness\n• Chronic joint problems\n• Injury due to falls",
    "Cause": "The disorder is caused by mutations in part of a gene (CLCN1) encoding the ClC-1 chloride channel, resulting in muscle fiber membranes having an unusually exaggerated response to stimulation (hyperexcitability).[citation needed]\nThree cases have been reported who were diagnosed with Thomsen's myotonia and proved on genetic testing not to have mutations in the chloride gene but rather in the alpha-subunit of the voltage gated sodium channel (SCN4A).[15] Like chloride channel mutations, patients with sodium channel mutations may have a very varied phenotype, making a diagnosis more difficult.[citation needed]",

    "Signs and symptoms": "Characteristic nails, especially of thumbs - as in the description above (the most common and recognizable feature of NPS, in about 95% patients).\nThe skeletal structures of individuals who have this disorder may have pronounced deformities.  As reported by several medical doctors, the following features are commonly found in people who with nail–patella syndrome:[4]\nBones and joints[citation needed]\n• Patellar involvement is present in approximately 75% of patients;[5] however, patellar aplasia occurs in only 20%.\n• In instances in which the patellae are smaller or luxated, the knees may be unstable.\n• The knee joint may appear square.\n• Frequent flat feet and/or other foot deformities.\n• The elbows may have limited motion (e.g., limited pronation, supination, extension).\n• Subluxation of the radial head may occur.\n• Arthrodysplasia of the elbows is reported in approximately 75% of patients.\n• Exostoses arising from the posterior aspect of the iliac bones (\"iliac horns\") are present in as many as 70-75% of patients; this finding is considered pathognomonic for the syndrome.\n• Other reported bone changes include scoliosis, scapular hypoplasia, and the presence of cervical ribs.\n• A reduction in bone density, on average by about 8-20 %, which may lead to osteoporosis.[1]\n• General hyperextension of the joints can be present. On the other hand - a possible, sometimes occurring, generalized joint hypermobility/laxity has also been described.[6] However, it is not certain whether the hypermobility results from a mutation of the same gene or a possibly accompanying mutation of some different gene.\n• An elbow of a man with nail–patella syndrome (NPS)\n• This is a view from a different angle of the same man's other elbow\nGlaucoma is also closely associated with nail-patella, specifically open-angled glaucoma (OAG). Side effects may include frequent headaches, blurred vision, or total vision loss. This occurs gradually over time and symptoms may not be evident in children.[7]\nKidney issues may arise such as deposition of protein in the urine and nephritis.  Proteinuria is usually the first sign of kidney involvement. It can reveal itself either rapidly or years after having asymptomatic deposition of protein in the urine, kidney failure occurs in around 15% of NPS patients (in form of end-stage failure).[8] Irritable bowel syndrome and other gastrointestinal involvement, decreased sensation of pain and temperature in the hands and feet, e.g. Raynaud syndrome and other vascular disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression and thin tooth enamel are associated with NPS, but the exact nature of these relationships remains not fully explained.[9][10][11]\nGeneral appearance (general phenotype) - it is possible and frequent to have lean body type (difficulty gaining weight even with a healthy and nutritious diet) and underdeveloped muscle mass, particularly in the limbs. It is most noticeable in young people with nail-patella syndrome, but not exclusively. Absence or underdevelopment of various muscles (e.g. triceps, leading to thin structure of arms)[12] and a high forehead - also may be present.[1][13] However, low body weight sometimes can change (grow) with age, for example in women going through menopause, under the influence of other changes in metabolism, various medications and other factors. Eventual possible weight gain - later in life - does not necessarily have to be associated with an increase in muscle mass.\nNail–patella syndrome may cause diverse and not always uniform symptoms in individual patients - it is associated with high phenotypic variability, even in the same family.[1] In milder cases, some patients may only experience part of symptoms of this syndrome. Some potential symptoms (such as e.g. possible kidney damage or mentioned glaucoma) may appear and become more apparent with age and/or under the influence of additional aggravating factors. Other, than mentioned above, possible symptoms of NPS are also described in specialized sources, because the mutated gene can affect the entire body.",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "The hallmark features of this syndrome are poorly developed fingernails (especially of thumbs) - in approximately 95 percent of patients, rarely - toenails (especially the smallest nail of feet), and hypoplastic or aplastic patellae (kneecaps) - in approximately 75 percent of patients. Sometimes, this disease causes the affected person to have either no thumbnails or a small piece of a thumbnail on the edge of the thumb.  The lack of development or complete absence of fingernails results from the loss of function mutations in the \nLMX1B gene. A unique feature of this syndrome is also the triangular lunulae  at the base of the fingernails - especially in NPS patients who have nails present (in healthy individuals, without NPS, lunulae are semicircular).[10]  This mutation may cause a reduction in dorsalising signals, which then results in the failure to normally develop dorsal specific structures such as nails and patellae.[18] Other common abnormalities include elbow deformities, kidney disease,[19] and abnormally shaped pelvic (hip) bones.[citation needed] Individual cases of this syndrome may be diverse and not fully symptomatic, as is the case with any genetic syndrome, they may also affect fitness and functioning of the body to varying degrees - from severe to mild cases (different mutations - pathogenic variants regarding other fragments/exons of the same gene and varying degrees of impact on the phenotype and areas of the body, even in the case of the same mutation in relatives in the same family).",
    "Treatment": "Treatment for NPS varies depending on the symptoms observed.\n• Perform screening for kidney disease and glaucoma, surgery, intensive physiotherapy, or genetic counseling.[15]\n• ACE inhibitors are taken to treat proteinuria and hypertension in NPS patients.[20][21]\n• Dialysis and kidney transplant.[22][23]\n• Physical therapy, bracing and analgesics for joint pain.[citation needed]",

They additional have weakness and wasting of muscle and fat loss that worsens over time. This leads to an extremely thin (emaciated) appearance in the face, chest, and arms.[4]\nOther symptoms of Nakajo-Nishimura syndrome are enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), shortage of red blood cells (anemia), reduced levels of platelet blood cells (thrombocytopenia), and calcification in the basal ganglia area of the brain. There have been cases of intellectual disability in affected individuals.[4]\nNakajo-Nishimura syndrome has overlapping symptoms with joint contractures, muscular atrophy, microcytic anemia, and panniculitis-induced lipodystrophy (JMP) syndrome and chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperature (CANDLE) syndrome.

  {
    "Disease": "Narcolepsy",
    "Signs and symptoms": "There are two main characteristics of narcolepsy: excessive daytime sleepiness and abnormal REM sleep.[15] Excessive daytime sleepiness occurs even after adequate night time sleep. A person with narcolepsy is likely to become drowsy or fall asleep, often at inappropriate or undesired times and places, or just be very tired throughout the day. Narcoleptics may not be able to experience the amount of restorative deep sleep that healthy people experience due to abnormal REM regulation – they are not \"oversleeping.\" Narcoleptics typically have higher REM sleep density than non-narcoleptics, but also experience more REM sleep without atonia.[16] Many narcoleptics have sufficient REM sleep, but do not feel refreshed or alert throughout the day.[17] This can feel like living their entire lives in a constant state of sleep deprivation.[medical citation needed]\nExcessive sleepiness can vary in severity and appears most commonly during monotonous situations that require little interaction.[17] Daytime naps may occur with little warning and may be physically irresistible. These naps can occur several times a day. They are typically refreshing, but only for a brief period. Vivid dreams may be experienced regularly, even during short naps. Drowsiness may persist for prolonged periods or remain constant. Additionally, nighttime sleep may be fragmented, with frequent awakenings. A second prominent symptom of narcolepsy is abnormal REM sleep. Narcoleptics are unique in that instead of following the typical sleep cycle, they enter into the REM phase of sleep at the beginning of sleep, even when sleeping during the day.[15]\nThe classic symptoms of the disorder, often referred to as the \"tetrad of narcolepsy\", are cataplexy, sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations, and excessive daytime sleepiness.[18] Other symptoms may include automatic behaviors and night-time wakefulness.[15][19][20] These symptoms may not occur in all people with narcolepsy.\n• An episodic loss of muscle function, known as cataplexy, ranging from slight weakness such as limpness at the neck or knees, sagging facial muscles, weakness at the knees often referred to as \"knee buckling\",[21] or inability to speak clearly, to a complete body collapse. Episodes may be triggered by sudden emotional reactions such as laughter, anger, surprise, or fear. The person remains conscious throughout the episode. In some cases, cataplexy may resemble epileptic seizures.[22] Usually, speech is slurred and vision is impaired (double vision, inability to focus), but hearing and awareness remain normal. Cataplexy also has a severe emotional impact on narcoleptics, as it can cause extreme anxiety, fear, and avoidance of people or situations that might elicit an attack. Cataplexy is generally considered to be unique to narcolepsy and is analogous to sleep paralysis in that the usually protective paralysis mechanism occurring during sleep is inappropriately activated. The opposite of this situation (failure to activate this protective paralysis) occurs in rapid eye movement behavior disorder.[medical citation needed]\n• Periods of wakefulness at night.[15]\n• The temporary inability to talk or move when waking (or, less often, when falling asleep), known as sleep paralysis. It may last a few seconds to minutes. This is often frightening but is not dangerous.[medical citation needed]\n• Vivid, often frightening, dreamlike experiences that occur while dozing or falling asleep, known as hypnagogic hallucinations. Hypnopompic hallucinations refer to the same sensations while awakening from sleep. These hallucinations may manifest in the form of visual or auditory sensations.[15]\nIn most cases, the first symptom of narcolepsy to appear is excessive and overwhelming daytime sleepiness. The other symptoms may begin alone or in combination months or years after the onset of the daytime naps. There are wide variations in the development, severity, and order of appearance of cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations in individuals. Only about 20 to 25 percent of people with narcolepsy experience all four symptoms. The excessive daytime sleepiness generally persists throughout life, but sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations may not.\nMany people with narcolepsy also have insomnia for extended periods. The excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy often become severe enough to cause serious problems in a person's social, personal, and professional life. Normally, when an individual is awake, brain waves show a regular rhythm. When a person first falls asleep, the brain waves become slower and less regular, which is called non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. After about an hour and a half of NREM sleep, the brain waves begin to show a more active pattern again, called REM sleep (rapid eye movement sleep), when most remembered dreaming occurs. Associated with the EEG-observed waves during REM sleep, muscle atonia is present, called REM atonia.[medical citation needed]\nIn narcolepsy, the order and length of NREM and REM sleep periods are disturbed, with REM sleep occurring at sleep onset instead of after a period of NREM sleep. Also, some aspects of REM sleep that normally occur only during sleep, like lack of muscular control, sleep paralysis, and vivid dreams, occur at other times in people with narcolepsy. For example, the lack of muscular control can occur during wakefulness in a cataplexy episode; it is said that there is an intrusion of REM atonia during wakefulness. Sleep paralysis and vivid dreams can occur while falling asleep or waking up. Simply put, the brain does not pass through the normal stages of dozing and deep sleep but goes directly into (and out of) rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.[medical citation needed]\nAs a consequence, nighttime sleep does not include as much deep sleep, so the brain tries to \"catch up\" during the day, hence excessive daytime sleepiness. People with narcolepsy may visibly fall asleep at unpredictable moments (such motions as head bobbing are common). People with narcolepsy fall quickly into what appears to be very deep sleep, and they wake up suddenly and can be disoriented when they do (dizziness is a common occurrence). They have very vivid dreams, which they often remember in great detail. People with narcolepsy may dream even when they only fall asleep for a few seconds. Along with vivid dreaming, people with narcolepsy are known to have audio or visual hallucinations before falling asleep or before waking up.[23]\nNarcoleptics can gain excess weight; children can gain 20 to 40 pounds (9.1 to 18.1 kg) when they first develop narcolepsy; in adults, the body-mass index is about 15% above average.[24][25]",
    "Cause": "The exact cause of narcolepsy is unknown, and it may be caused by several distinct factors.[1][7] The mechanism involves the loss of orexin-releasing neurons within the lateral hypothalamus (about 70,000 neurons[26]).[27][28]\nSome researches indicated that people with type 1 narcolepsy (narcolepsy with cataplexy) have a lower level of orexin (hypocretin), which is a chemical contributing to the regulation of wakefulness and REM sleep.[29] It also acts as a neurotransmitter to enable nerve cells to communicate.[14]\nIn up to 10% of cases, there is a family history of the disorder. Family history is more common in narcolepsy with cataplexy.[1] There is a strong link with certain genetic variants,[27] which may make T-cells susceptible to react to the orexin-releasing neurons (autoimmunity)[30] after being stimulated by infection with H1N1 influenza.[12] In addition to genetic factors, low levels of orexin peptides have been correlated with a history of infection, diet, contact with toxins such as pesticides, and brain injuries due to head trauma, brain tumors or strokes.[15][27]",
    "Diagnosis": "The third edition of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3) differentiates between narcolepsy with cataplexy (type 1) and narcolepsy without cataplexy (type 2), while the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) uses the diagnosis of narcolepsy to refer to type 1 narcolepsy only. The DSM-5 refers to narcolepsy without cataplexy as hypersomnolence disorder.[42] The most recent edition of the International Classification of Diseases, ICD-11, currently identifies three types of narcolepsy: type 1 narcolepsy, type 2 narcolepsy, and unspecified narcolepsy.[43]\nICSD-3 diagnostic criteria posit that the individual must experience \"daily periods of irrepressible need to sleep or daytime lapses into sleep\" for both subtypes of narcolepsy.[42] This symptom must last for at least three months. For a diagnosis of type 1 narcolepsy, the person must present with either cataplexy, a mean sleep latency of less than 8 minutes, and two or more sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMPs), or they must present with a hypocretin-1 concentration of less than 110 pg/mL.[42] A diagnosis of type 2 narcolepsy requires a mean sleep latency of less than 8 minutes, two or more SOREMPs, and a hypocretin-1 concentration of more than 110 pg/mL. In addition, the hypersomnolence and sleep latency findings cannot be better explained by other causes.[42]\nDSM-5 narcolepsy criteria requires that the person to display recurrent periods of \"an irrepressible need to sleep, lapsing into sleep, or napping\" for at least three times a week over three months.[42] The individual must also display one of the following: cataplexy, hypocretin-1 concentration of less than 110 pg/mL, REM sleep latency of less than 15 minutes, or a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) showing sleep latency of less than 8 minutes and two or more SOREMPs.[42] For a diagnosis of hypersomnolence disorder, the individual must present with excessive sleepiness despite at least 7 hours of sleep as well as either recurrent lapses into daytime sleep, nonrestorative sleep episodes of 9 or more hours, or difficulty staying awake after awakening. In addition, the hypersomnolence must occur at least three times a week for three months, and must be accompanied by significant distress or impairment. It also cannot be explained by another sleep disorder, coexisting mental or medical disorders, or medication.[44]",

For the management of sensorineural hearing loss, hearing aids have been used. Treatments, depending upon the cause and severity, may include a pharmacological approach (i.e., the use of certain steroids), or surgical intervention, like a cochlear implant.[17][18][19]\nPulmonary, or pulmonic stenosis is an often congenital narrowing of the pulmonary valve; it can be present in nasodigitoacoustic-affected infants.[4] Treatment of this cardiac abnormality can require surgery, or non-surgical procedures like balloon valvuloplasty (widening the valve with a balloon catheter).[20]"

The redness and swelling usually blend into surrounding normal tissues. The overlying skin may appear shiny and tense as well.[8]\nLater signs more suggestive of necrotizing changes (but only present in less than half of cases) are:\n• Bullae (blisters)\n• Crepitus (palpable gas in tissues)\n• Reduced or absent sensation over the skin of the affected area[2]\n• Ecchymosis (bruising) that progresses to skin necrosis.[2] This is because the skin changes color from red to purple and black due to clotting blood vessels[8]\nRapid progression to shock despite antibiotic therapy is another indication of necrotizing fasciitis.

When in doubt, a 2-cm incision can be made into the affected tissue under local anesthesia.[2][15]  If a finger easily separates the tissue along the fascia, then the finger test is positive.

    "Cause": "Common causes include bilateral adrenalectomy for the treatment of Cushing's disease and hypopituitarism.[5] The onset of the disease can occur up to 24 years after bilateral adrenalectomy has been performed, with an average of up to 15 years after.[6] A preventative measure that can be utilized is prophylactic radiotherapy when bilateral adrenalectomy is being performed to prevent Nelson's syndrome from manifesting.[7] Screening can also be done with the help of an MRI in order to visualize the pituitary for tumors. If tumors are not present then an MRI should be performed at intervals.[8] Hyper-pigmentation and fasting ACTH levels within plasma above 154 pmol/L are predictive of Nelson's syndrome after an adrenalectomy.[8] Risk factors include being younger in age and pregnancy.[2]",
    "Diagnosis": "Common diagnostic techniques include: [11]\n• MRIs\n• CAT scans\n• blood samples.\nBlood samples are assessed for the absence or presence of aldosterone and cortisol.[4] Physical examinations are also useful in patients to examine vision, skin pigmentation, how the body replaces steroids, and the cranial nerves.[5] Recent advancements in high-resolution MRIs allow for adenomas to be detected during the early stages of Nelson syndrome.[2] Physical examination including height, weight, vital signs, blood pressure, eye examination, thyroid examination, abdominal examination, neurological examination, skin examination, and pubertal staging needs to be assessed.[5] Through blood pressure and pulse readings can indicate hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency.[5] Hyper-pigmentation, hyporeflexia, and loss of vision can also indicate Nelson's syndrome when assessed together.[5] Specifically for a child who might have Nelson's syndrome, the patient should be questioned about the symptoms of the disease, as well as symptoms of other diseases to narrow down which disease the patient presents with. The patient should be questioned about how often and to what degree headaches, visual disturbances, and symptoms associated with pituitary malfunction occur. Additionally, adrenal steroid replacement should be assessed.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Common treatments for Nelson's syndrome include radiation or surgical procedure. Radiation allows for the limitation of the growth of the pituitary gland and the adenomas. If the adenomas start to affect the surrounding structures of the brain, then a micro-surgical technique can be adapted to remove the adenomas in a transsphenoidal (bone at the base of the skull) process.[4] Death may result in development of a locally aggressive pituitary tumor. However, does not commonly occur with pituitary diseases.[10] In the rare case, ACTH-secreting tumors can become malignant. Morbidity from the disease can occur due to pituitary tissue compression or replacement, and compression of structures that surround the pituitary fossa.[2] The tumor can also compress the optic apparatus, disturb cerebrospinal fluid flow, meningitis, and testicular enlargement in rare cases.[2]",

    "Disease": "Nemaline myopathy",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Signs vary from person to person. Young children and babies lack movement and have a difficult time eating and breathing. For young children not diagnosed immediately at birth, these are usually the first visible symptoms. One sign is a swollen face in disproportional areas. Other examples in newborns include swaying and a difficulty in moving. Other symptoms include feeble muscles in the neck and upper rib cage area. In adults, the most common symptom is respiratory problems.[7] Other symptoms in adults could range from mild to severe speech impediments.  It is common to be diagnosed with scoliosis in relation to nemaline myopathy.[8]\nAs babies that have NM develop and become of age when they should start walking, many take longer than average due to the lack of muscle, or just muscle fatigue.[9]\nSince facial muscles are involved in NM takeover, elongated faces and a lower mandible are often observed in people with NM. People affected by NM usually will begin to feel muscle exhaustion between ages 20–50. NM is usually not progressive. Gastroesophageal reflux, although not common, is associated with NM. Heart abnormalities can occur as a result of NM, but the likelihood of that happening are not high.[7]",
    "Cause": "Nemaline myopathy is caused by mutations in one of at least 11 different genes.[2][12]  Nemaline myopathy is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder and both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms can occur.  Diagnosis is made based upon clinical signs such as muscle weakness, absent or low deep tendon reflexes (hyporeflexia), and a high-arched palate,  along with electron-dense aggregates, called nemaline rods, being observed at the microscopic level within muscle fibers.  Genetic confirmation through identification of a known genetic mutation in the patient is also an important component of diagnosis.[13][14]\nThe two most common gene mutations causing nemaline myopathy are found on NEB or ACTA1.[15] Mutations of the NEB gene usually result in symptoms present at birth or beginning in early childhood. This mutation results in about 50% of affected nemaline myopathy patients. The most common inheritance pathway for those with mutations in NEB is autosomal recessive in which each parent carries one mutated copy along with one normal functioning copy of the gene, and they pass the mutated copy to their offspring. In some cases, occasionally with ACTA1 mutations, NM can be caused by an inheritance pattern of autosomal dominance.  This mutation results in about 15 to 25 percent of NM cases.[16]  One reason why this is lower is because NM is associated with de novo mutations in ACTA1, occurring spontaneously in the egg or sperm.[9] When the condition is heritable, each pregnancy with the same partners has the same risk of passing the mutated genes to offspring.  New mutations (de novo) can also occur causing NM and de novo mutations have been most often found to occur in the ACTA1 gene.[16]\nMYPN is the last found gene related to NM The risk of all cases of nemaline myopathy is the same in males and females.[9]\nThe physical capabilities of a given person with NM do not correlate well either with genotype or with muscle pathology as observed in the biopsy.[18]",
    "Diagnosis": "• Electromyography or (EMG). This procedure determines if nerve or muscle cells are damaged. Since a common symptom of Nemaline Myopathy is muscle weakness this allows doctors to determine where and why the weakness is occurring.[7]\n• MRI of the Musculoskeletal System. MRI uses a magnetic field to take pictures of body structures and allows physicians to determine if a patient has a certain disease.[7]\n• Needle biopsy A needle biopsy allows a physician to test specific cells in the body. These cells are sent to a laboratory to undergo testing and can further determine why muscle weakness throughout the body could be occurring. This testing can confirm that muscle cells contain rod like structures.[7]",
    "Treatment": "At present, Nemaline myopathy does not have a cure. Nemaline myopathy is a very rare disease that only affects 1 out of 50,000 on average, although recent studies show that this number is even smaller. There are a number of treatments to minimize the symptoms of the disease. The treatments and procedures to help patients with nemaline myopathy vary depending on the severity of the disease. A possible accommodation could be the use of a stabilizer, such as a brace. Other means include moderate stretching and moderate exercise to help target muscles maintain maximum health.[22]\nAs people with NM grow and develop throughout their lives, it is important for them to see a variety of health professionals regularly, including a neurologist, physical therapist, and others, such as speech therapists and psychologists, to help both the patient and family adjust to everyday life.[10]",

    "Disease": "Neonatal diabetes",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The first sign of neonatal diabetes is often slowed fetal growth, followed by unusually low birthweight.[4] At some point within the first six months of life, infants with neonatal diabetes tend to experience the classic symptoms of type 1 diabetes: thirst, frequent urination, and signs of dehydration.[4] The timing of symptom onset varies with the type of neonatal diabetes. Those with transient neonatal diabetes tend to have symptoms in the first few days or weeks of life, with affected children showing weight loss and signs of dehydration, along with high levels of sugar in the blood and urine. Some children also have high levels of ketones in the blood and urine, or signs of metabolic acidosis.[5] Permanent neonatal diabetes starts slightly later, typicalaly around six weeks of age. Regardless of type, preterm infants tend to experience symptoms earlier, typically around one week of age.[6]\nNeonatal diabetes is classified into three subtypes: permanent, transient, and syndromic; each with distinct genetic causes and symptoms.[5]\nSyndromic neonatal diabetes is the term for diabetes as just one component of any of several complex syndromes that affect neonates, including IPEX syndrome, Wolcott-Rallison syndrome, and Wolfram syndrome. Symptoms vary widely based on the syndrome.[5]",
    "Cause": "Neonatal diabetes is a genetic disease, caused by genetic variations that were either spontaneously acquired or inherited from one's parents. At least 30 distinct genetic variants can result in neonatal diabetes.[8] The development and treatment of neonatal diabetes will vary based on the particular genetic cause. Known genetic variants cause neonatal diabetes by five major mechanisms: Preventing the development of the pancreas or β cells, promoting β-cell death by autoimmunity or endoplasmic reticulum stress, preventing β cells from recognizing glucose or secreting insulin, or abnormal expression of the 6q24 region on chromosome 6.[8]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis of neonatal diabetes is complicated by the fact that hyperglycemia is common in neonates – particularly in preterm infants, 25–75% of whom have hyperglycemia.[6] Neonatal hyperglycemia typically begins in the first ten days of life, and lasts just two to three days.[6]",
    "Treatment": "Neonates with diabetes are initially treated by intravenous infusion of insulin, with a dose of 0.05 units/kilogram/hour commonly used.[15]\nTreatment options depend on the underlying genetic variations of each person with neonatal diabetes. The most common mutations underlying neonatal diabetes – KCNJ11 and ABCC8 variants – can be treated with sulfonylureas alone, eventually transitioning off of insulin completely.[15]\nIn many cases, neonatal diabetes may be treated with oral sulfonylureas such as glyburide. Physicians may order genetic tests to determine whether or not transitioning from insulin to sulfonylurea drugs is appropriate for a patient.[citation needed]\nPeople whose disease is caused by KATP variants can often be treated with high-dose sulfonylureas, which directly promote the closure of the KATP channel.[7]",

    "Disease": "Neonatal hemochromatosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "N/A",
    "Cause": "Almost all cases of neonatal hemochromatosis (NH) are caused by Gestational Alloimmune Liver Disease (GALD). In GALD, the mother becomes sensitized to a fetal hepatic antigen; the resulting IgG antibodies cross the placenta, activate complement, and destroy fetal hepatocytes, triggering the iron-overload phenotype that defines NH. The NH could be classified as a congenital alloimmune hepatitis.[1] Its estimated prevalence in the world is <1 case per 1,000,000 live births. The risk of GALD-NH occurring in subsequent pregnancies is very high (80-95%), but prophylactic high-dose maternal intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy reduces the recurrence rate to 5-10%. GALD has other forms of presentation besides NH.",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of NH is based on a stepwise approach combining clinical findings, laboratory tests, imaging studies and targeted biopsies.\n• Clinical suspicion: Newborn with acute liver failure (jaundice, coagulopathy, ascites, edema, hypoglycemia). Prenatal history suggestive of NH (fetal hydrops, oligohydramnios, or intrauterine growth restriction).\n• Laboratory studies: Elevated transaminases, low serum albumin, impaired coagulation (INR >3), elevated ferritin (typically >800 ng/ml), increased transferrin saturation, markedly elevated alpha-fetoprotein.\n• Imaging studies: MRI detects hepatic iron overload and demonstrates extrahepatic overload and siderosis in the pancreas, myocardium, thyroid, and salivary glands. Abdominal ultrasound to exclude biliary obstruction.\n• Biopsy: Minor salivary gland (there are hemosiderin deposits). Liver biopsy if MRI and salivary gland biopsy are nondiagnostic.\n• Confirmation of NH: Positive extrahepatic siderosis on MRI or biopsy.",
    "Treatment": "In 2004, effective treatment of the disease was limited to liver transplants.[2]\n• Current postnatal therapy\nAny neonate with suspected GALD-NH should receive an initial dose of intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG) while diagnostic work-up is in progress. First-line definitive therapy combines a double-volume exchange transfusion (DVET) to clear maternal antibodies with high-dose IVIG to block complement-mediated hepatocyte injury. Improvement in coagulation (INR) may take 4-6 weeks as the liver regenerates.\n• Liver transplantation\nDespite DVET + IVIG, approximately 20% of infants still require liver transplantation when medical therapy fails or liver damage is irreversible.\n• Antenatal prophylaxis\nHigh-dose maternal IVIG weekly starting at 14-18 week’s gestation and continue through delivery reduces recurrence of GALD-NH in subsequent pregnancies.",

    "Disease": "Neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The age of onset is almost always before 3 months of age. Many infants are born preterm (1/3 cases) and dysmature. The babies are frequently small for dates. The placenta may be abnormal with non-specific inflammation on histology. Umbilical cord anomalies have occasionally been reported. In severe cases, signs in the brain may be detected on prenatal ultrasound.\nThe disease manifests in many forms, making the diagnosis difficult, but the most common features of this disease involve the skin, joints, and central nervous system.\nAll have a maculopapular urticarial skin rash that is often present at birth (75% cases). It is probably more correctly described as an urticarial-like rash. The presence of the rash varies with time, and biopsy of these skin lesions shows a perivascular inflammatory infiltrate including granulocytes.\nIn about 35–65% of cases, arthritis occurs. Joint signs are variably expressed and can lead to transient swelling without sequelae between crises, or to unpredictable anomalies of growth cartilage and long bones epiphyses suggestive of a pseudo-tumour. Biopsies reveal hypertrophic cartilage without inflammatory cells. This most commonly affects the large joints (knees, ankles, elbows, and wrists) but may also involve the small joints of the hands and feet. It is usually bilateral and painful. A common and characteristic feature is giant kneecaps. Severe cases may result in contractures (joint deformities).\nMost patients eventually have neurological problems. These manifest themselves in three principal ways: chronic meningitis, involvement of both the optic tract and eye, and sensorineural hearing loss. The chronic meningitis presents with the features of chronically raised intracranial pressure: headaches, vomiting, ventriculomegaly, hydrocephalus, macromegaly, cerebral atrophy, and optic atrophy. Some of these features may be evidenced on prenatal ultrasound. In 50% of cases, intellectual deficit occurs. Seizures occur in 25% of cases, but other manifestations are rare. Histological examination shows infiltration of the meninges with polymorphs.\nOcular manifestations occur in 80% of cases and include uveitis (70%), papillary involvement, conjunctivitis, and optical neuritis. If untreated, these may result in blindness (25%). The sensorineural hearing loss occurs in 75%, and tends to be progressive leading to deafness in 20% of cases.\nAlmost all children are remarkably short and have growth delay. Fever is extremely common but inconstant and is most often mild. Anemia is frequent. Other findings that have been reported include macrocephaly (95%), large fontanelle, prominent forehead, flattening of the nasal bridge (saddleback nose), short and thick extremities, and finger clubbing. The liver and spleen may be enlarged. Lymph node enlargement may also be present.\nLater in life, secondary amyloidosis may occur. Delayed puberty and secondary amenorrhoea are not uncommon. Hoarseness due to inflammation of the laryngeal cartilage has also been reported.",
    "Cause": "The disease is caused in 60% of cases by a mutated gene called CIAS1 that is known to be involved in other syndromes that appear somewhat similar, such as Muckle–Wells syndrome and familial cold urticaria. In many patients, the parents do not have the same mutation, indicating the problem was not inherited, even though it is a genetic disease. CIAS1 is involved in controlling the immune system, which is why the mutation leads to out-of-control inflammation.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is based on observing the patient and finding the constellation of symptoms and signs described above. A few blood tests help, by showing signs of long-standing inflammation. There is no specific test for the disease, though now that the gene that causes the disease is known, that may change.[citation needed]\nRoutine laboratory investigations are non-specific: anaemia, increased numbers of polymorphs, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and elevated concentrations of C-reactive protein are typically all the abnormalities found. Lumbar puncture shows elevated levels of polymorphs (20–70% of cases) and occasionally raised eosinophil counts (0–30% of cases). CSF neopterin may be elevated. The X ray abnormalities are unique and characteristic of this syndrome. These changes include bony overgrowth due to premature ossification of the patella and the long bone epiphyses in very young children and bowing of long bones with widening and shortening periosteal reaction in older ones.[citation needed]\nAudiometry shows a progressive sensineural deafness. Visual examination shows optic atrophy and an increase in the blind spot. CT is usually normal but may show enlargement of the ventricles. MRI with contrast may show enhancement of leptomeninges and cochlea consistent with chronic meningitis. EEG shows a non-specific pattern with slow waves and spike discharges.\nPolymorphs tend to show increased expression of CD10.",
    "Treatment": "There have been attempts to control the inflammation using drugs that work in other conditions where inflammation is a problem. The most successful of these are steroids, but they have side effects when used long term. Other medications, including methotrexate, colchicine and canakinumab, have been tried with some success.

Dehydration is common, and incontinence can occur secondary to chronic bladder distension.[1] On investigation, there will be an increased plasma osmolarity and decreased urine osmolarity. As pituitary function is normal, antidiuretic hormone levels are likely to be abnormal or raised. Polyuria will continue as long as the patient is able to drink. If the patient is unable to drink and is still unable to concentrate the urine, then hypernatremia will ensue with its neurologic symptoms.",

They may be differentiated by using the water deprivation test.\nRecently, lab assays for antidiuretic hormone are available and can aid in diagnosis. If the patient is able to rehydrate properly, sodium concentration should be nearer to the maximum of the normal range. This, however, is not a diagnostic finding, as it depends on patient hydration.[citation needed]\nDesmopressin can also be used; if the patient is able to concentrate urine following administration of desmopressin, then the cause of the diabetes insipidus is neurogenic diabetes insipidus; if no response occurs to desmopressin, then the cause is likely to be nephrogenic.",
    "Treatment": "Persons with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus must consume enough fluids to equal the amount of urine produced.  Any underlying cause such as high blood calcium must be corrected to treat nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. The first line of treatment is hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride.[10] Patients may also consider a low-salt and low-protein diet.\nThiazide diuretics cause a mild decrease in extracellular fluid volume through natriuresis and diuresis which in turn increases the proximal absorption of sodium and water, lowering urine output.[11]\nHigh serum osmolarity stimulates polydipsia in an attempt to dilute the serum back to normal and provide free water for excreting the excess serum solutes. However, since the patient is unable to concentrate urine to excrete the excess solutes, the resulting urine fails to decrease serum osmolarity and the cycle repeats itself, hence polyuria.",

    "Disease": "Netherton syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Netherton syndrome is characterized by chronic skin inflammation, universal pruritus (itch), severe dehydration, and stunted growth. Patients with this disorder tend to have a hair shaft defect (trichorrhexis invaginata), also known as \"bamboo hair\". The disrupted skin barrier function in affected individuals also presents a high susceptibility to infection and allergy, leading to the development of scaly, reddish skin similar to atopic dermatitis.[5] In severe cases, these atopic manifestations persist throughout the individual's life, and consequently post-natal mortality rates are high. In less severe cases, this develops into the milder ichthyosis linearis circumflexa.[3]\nNetherton syndrome has recently been characterised as a primary immunodeficiency, which straddles the innate and acquired immune system, much as does Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome.  A group of Netherton patients have been demonstrated to have altered immunoglobulin levels (typically high IgE and low to normal IgG) and immature natural killer cells. These natural killer cells have a reduced lytic function; which can be improved with regular infusions of immunoglobulin (see 'Treatment'); although the mechanism for this is not clear.[6]\nPatients are more prone than healthy people to infections of all types, especially recurrent skin infections with staphylococcus.  They may have more severe infections; but are not as vulnerable to opportunistic pathogens as patients with true natural killer cell deficiency-type SCID.[citation needed]",
    "Cause": "Netherton syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with mutations in the SPINK5 gene, which encodes the serine protease inhibitor lympho-epithelial Kazal-type-related inhibitor (LEKTI).[2] These mutations result in a dysfunctional protein that has a reduced capacity to inhibit serine proteases expressed in the skin. Potential endogenous targets of LEKTI include KLK5, KLK7 and KLK14.[7] These enzymes are involved in various aspects of epidermal remodelling, including desquamation, PAR-2 activation and degradation of lipid hydrolases, suggesting a potential mechanism for the development of atopic manifestations characteristic of Netherton syndrome.[8]\nDisease severity is determined by the level of LEKTI expression and, consequently, serine protease activity. Complete SPINK5 gene deletions have been linked to severe cases, while mutations which induce alternate splicing or create premature stop codons may lead to varying levels of severity.[8] Furthermore, LEKTI-knockout mice exhibit a phenotype similar to Netherton syndrome in humans.[5]",

    "Treatment": "There is no known cure at the moment but there are several things that can be done to relieve the symptoms. Moisturising products are very helpful to minimize the scaling/cracking, and anti-infective treatments are useful when appropriate because the skin is very susceptible to infection. Extra protein in the diet during childhood is also beneficial, to replace that which is lost through the previously mentioned \"leaky\" skin.[citation needed]\nSteroid and retinoid products have been proven ineffective against Netherton syndrome, and may in fact make things worse for the affected individual.[citation needed]\nIntravenous immunoglobulin has become established as the treatment of choice in Netherton syndrome.[6]  This therapy reduces infection; enables improvement and even resolution of the skin and hair abnormalities, and dramatically improves quality of life of the patients; although exactly how it achieves this is not known.  Given this; it is possible that the reason Netherton syndrome usually is not very severe at or shortly after birth is due to a protective effect of maternal antibodies; which cross the placenta but wane by four to six months.[citation needed]",

    "Disease": "Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The signs and symptoms of NMOSD depend on the neurologic structures the disease affects, and, to some extent, the antibodies involved.",
    "Cause": "NMOSD is caused by an autoimmune attack on the nervous system. In more than 80% of cases, IgG autoantibodies against aquaporin-4 (anti-AQP4+) are the cause, and in 10–40% of the remaining cases, IgG antibodies against MOG are the cause.[1] The cause of the remaining cases is still unknown, and it is likely heterogeneous.[14][15]\nWhy autoimmunity develops is largely unknown. Multiple genetic and environmental factors are known to increase the risk of developing NMOSD. The strongest risk factor is being female, especially in AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD.[1] Multiple human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles are associated with NMOSD.[1]\nNMO was associated in the past with many systemic diseases. Some researchers have pointed out that some other cases could be paraneoplastic.[16] It appears that lupus can produce NMO-IgG autoantibodies, leading to cases of lupus-derived NMO.[17]\nThe discovery of NMO-IgG (anti-AQP4) has opened a new avenue of research into the causes.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "NMOSD is diagnosed using consensus clinical criteria, which have undergone multiple revisions, most recently in 2015.[32][33]\nDiagnostic criteria are more relaxed for seropositive AQP4–IgG cases than they are for seronegative AQP4-IgG ones. If AQP4-IgG is detected, then one core clinical criterion, along with the ruling out of alternative diagnoses, is sufficient for NMOSD diagnosis.[34]\nIf AQP4-IgG is undetected, or its status is unknown, two core clinical criteria, each with supportive MRI findings, along with the ruling out of alternative diagnoses, are needed for an NMOSD diagnosis.[35]\nRarely, it has been reported that some courses of anti-NMDAR are consistent with NMO.[36] Preliminary reports suggest that other autoantibodies may play a role in rare cases of NMO.[37][38]\nNMOSD with MOG-IgG is considered a manifestation of anti-MOG associated encephalomyelitis.[39]",

    "Disease": "Neuromyotonia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "NMT is a diverse disorder. As a result of muscular hyperactivity, patients may present with muscle cramps, stiffness, myotonia-like symptoms (slow relaxation), associated walking difficulties, hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), myokymia (quivering of a muscle), fasciculations (muscle twitching), fatigue, exercise intolerance, myoclonic jerks and other related symptoms. These neuromyotonic discharges can cause bursts of spontaneous motor activity that present either continuously or in recurring, decrementing clusters. They can start and stop abruptly, typically waning in strength and are unaffected by voluntary activity.[3]\nThe symptoms (especially the stiffness and fasciculations) are most prominent in the calves, legs, trunk, and sometimes the face and neck, but can also affect other body parts. NMT symptoms may fluctuate in severity and frequency. Symptoms range from mere inconvenience to debilitating. At least a third of people also experience sensory symptoms.",
    "Cause": "The three causes of NMT are:[citation needed]\n• Acquired\n• Paraneoplastic\n• Hereditary\nThe acquired form is the most common, accounting for up to 80 percent of all cases and is suspected to be autoimmune-mediated, which is usually caused by antibodies against the neuromuscular junction.\nThe exact cause is unknown. However, autoreactive antibodies can be detected in a variety of peripheral (e.g. myasthenia gravis, Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome) and central nervous system (e.g. paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis) disorders. Their causative role has been established in some of these diseases but not all. Neuromyotonia is considered to be one of these with accumulating evidence for autoimmune origin over the last few years.[4] Autoimmune neuromyotonia is typically caused by antibodies that bind to potassium channels on the motor nerve resulting in continuous/hyper-excitability.  Onset is typically seen between the ages of 15–60, with most experiencing symptoms before the age of 40.[5] Some neuromyotonia cases do not only improve after plasma exchange but they may also have antibodies in their serum samples against voltage-gated potassium channels.[6] Moreover, these antibodies have been demonstrated to reduce potassium channel function in neuronal cell lines.\nIt is suspected that the peripheral nerve hyperexcitability associated with Isaacs' and Morvan's syndromes is a result of a potassium channel defect in the motor nerve membrane.[3]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is clinical and initially consists of ruling out more common conditions, disorders, and diseases, and usually begins at the general practitioner level. A doctor may conduct a basic neurological exam, including coordination, strength, reflexes, sensation, etc. A doctor may also run a series of tests that include blood work and MRIs.\nFrom there, a patient is likely to be referred to a neurologist or a neuromuscular specialist. The neurologist or specialist may run a series of more specialized tests, including needle electromyography EMG/ and nerve conduction studies (NCS) (these are the most important tests), chest CT (to rule out paraneoplastic) and specific blood work looking for voltage-gated potassium channel antibodies, acetylcholine receptor antibody, and serum immunofixation, TSH, ANA ESR, EEG etc. Neuromyotonia is characterized electromyographically by doublet, triplet or multiplet single unit discharges that have a high, irregular intraburst frequency.  Fibrillation potentials and fasciculations are often also present with electromyography.[7]\nBecause the condition is so rare, it can often be years before a correct diagnosis is made.\nNMT is not fatal and many of the symptoms can be controlled. However, because NMT mimics some symptoms of motor neuron disease (ALS) and other more severe diseases, which may be fatal, there can often be significant anxiety until a diagnosis is made. In some rare cases, acquired neuromyotonia has been misdiagnosed as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)[8] particularly if fasciculations may be evident in the absence of other clinical features of ALS. However, fasciculations are rarely the first sign of ALS as the hallmark sign is weakness.[9] Similarly, multiple sclerosis has been the initial misdiagnosis in some NMT patients. In order to get an accurate diagnosis see a trained neuromuscular specialist.\nPeople diagnosed with benign fasciculation syndrome or enhanced physiological tremor may experience similar symptoms as NMT, although it is unclear today whether BFS or EPT are weak forms of NMT.",
    "Treatment": "There is no known cure for neuromyotonia, but the condition is treatable. Anticonvulsants, including phenytoin and carbamazepine, usually provide significant relief from the stiffness, muscle spasms, and pain associated with neuromyotonia. Plasma exchange and IVIg treatment may provide short-term relief for patients with some forms of the acquired disorder.[5] It is speculated that the plasma exchange causes an interference with the function of the voltage-dependent potassium channels, one of the underlying issues of hyper-excitability in autoimmune neuromyotonia.[11] Botox injections also provide short-term relief. Immunosuppressants such as Prednisone may provide long term relief for patients with some forms of the acquired disorder.",

    "Disease": "Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The classic characterization of the group of neurodegenerative, lysosomal storage disorders called the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) is through the progressive, permanent loss of motor and psychological ability with a severe intracellular accumulation of lipofuscins,[2][3] with the United States and Northern European populations having slightly higher frequency with an occurrence of one in 10,000.[4] Four classic diagnoses have received the most attention from researchers and the medical field, differentiated from one another by age of symptomatic onset, duration, early-onset manifestations such as blindness or seizures, and the forms which lipofuscin accumulation takes.[2]\nIn the early infantile variant of NCL (also called INCL or Santavuori-Haltia), probands appear normal at birth, but early visual loss leading to complete retinal blindness by the age of 2 years is the first indicator of the disease; by 3 years of age, a vegetative state is reached, and by 4 years, isoelectric encephalograms confirm brain death. Late infantile variant usually manifests between 2 and 4 years of age with seizures and deterioration of vision. The maximum age before death for late infantile variant is 10–12 years.[5][6][7][8] Juvenile NCL (JNCL, Batten disease, or Spielmeyer-Vogt), with a prevalence of one in 100,000, usually arises between 4 and 10 years of age; the first symptoms include considerable vision loss due to retinal dystrophy, with seizures, psychological degeneration, and eventual death in the mid- to late 20s or 30s ensuing.[9] Adult variant NCL (ANCL or Kuf's disease) is less understood and generally manifests milder symptoms; however, while symptoms typically appear around 30 years of age, death usually occurs 10 years later.[1]\nAll the mutations that have been associated with this disease have been linked to genes involved with the neural synapses metabolism – most commonly with the reuse of vesicle proteins.[citation needed]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "Because vision loss is often an early sign, NCL may be first suspected during an eye exam. An eye doctor can detect a loss of cells within the eye that occurs in the three childhood forms of NCL. However, because such cell loss occurs in other eye diseases, the disorder cannot be diagnosed by this sign alone. Often, an eye specialist or other physician who suspects NCL may refer the child to a neurologist, a doctor who specializes in disease of the brain and nervous system. To diagnose NCL, the neurologist needs the patient's medical history and information from various laboratory tests.[citation needed]\nDiagnostic tests used for NCLs include:\n• Skin or tissue sampling: The doctor can examine a small piece of tissue under a  microscope to spot typical NCL deposits. These deposits are found in many different tissues, including skin, muscle, conjunctiva, rectal and others. Blood can also be used.[citation needed] These deposits take on characteristic shapes, depending on the variant under which they are said to occur: granular osmophilic deposits (GRODs) are generally characteristic of INCL, while curvilinear profiles, fingerprint profiles, and mixed-type inclusions are typically found in LINCL, JNCL, and ANCL, respectively.[citation needed]\n• Electroencephalogram or EEG: An EEG uses special patches placed on the scalp to record electrical currents inside the brain. This helps doctors see telltale patterns in the brain's electrical activity that suggest a patient has seizures.[citation needed]\n• Electrical studies of the eyes: These tests, which include visual-evoked responses and electroretinograms, can detect various eye problems common in childhood NCLs.[citation needed]\n• Brain scans: Imaging can help doctors look for changes in the brain's appearance. The most commonly used imaging technique is computed tomography (CT), which uses x-rays and a computer to create a sophisticated picture of the brain's tissues and structures. A CT scan may reveal brain areas that are decaying in NCL patients. An increasingly common tool is magnetic resonance imaging, which uses a combination of magnetic fields and radio waves, instead of radiation, to create a picture of the brain.[citation needed]\n• Enzyme assay: A recent development in diagnosis of NCL is the use of enzyme assays that look for specific missing lysosomal enzymes for infantile and late infantile versions only. This is a quick and easy diagnostic test.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Currently, no widely accepted treatment can cure, slow down, or halt the symptoms in the great majority of patients with NCL, but seizures may be controlled or reduced with use of antiepileptic drugs. Additionally, physical, speech, and occupational therapies may help affected patients retain functioning for as long as possible.[citation needed] Several experimental treatments are under investigation.[citation needed]",

    "Disease": "Neurotrophic keratitis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "N/A",
    "Cause": "The cornea lacks blood vessels and is among the most densely innervated structures of the human body. Corneal nerves are responsible for maintaining the anatomical and functional integrity of the cornea, conveying tactile, temperature and pain sensations, playing a role in the blink reflex, in wound healing and in the production and secretion of tears.[6]\nMost corneal nerve fibres are sensory in origin and are derived from the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve.[7] Congenital or acquired ocular and systemic diseases[8] can determine a lesion at different levels of the trigeminal nerve, which can lead to a reduction (hypoesthesia) or loss (anesthesia) of sensitivity of the cornea.[9]\nThe most common causes of loss of corneal sensitivity are viral infections (herpes simplex[10] and herpes zoster ophthalmicus),[11] chemical burns, physical injuries, corneal surgery, neurosurgery,[12] chronic use of topical medications, or chronic use of contact lenses.[13]\nPossible causes also include systemic diseases such as diabetes mellitus,[14] multiple sclerosis or leprosy.\nOther, albeit less frequent, potential causes of the disease are: intracranial space-occupying lesions such as neuroma, meningioma and aneurysms, which may compress the trigeminal nerve and reduce corneal sensitivity.[15]\nConversely, congenital conditions that may lead to this disorder are very rare.[16]",
    "Diagnosis": "NK is diagnosed on the basis of the patient's medical history and a careful examination of the eye and surrounding area.\nWith regard to the patient's medical history, special attention should be paid to any herpes virus infections and possible surgeries on the cornea, trauma, abuse of anaesthetics or chronic topical treatments, chemical burns or, use of contact lenses.[17] It is also necessary to investigate the possible presence of diabetes[18] or other systemic diseases such as multiple sclerosis.\nThe clinical examination is usually performed through a series of assessments and tools:[19]\n• General examination of cranial nerves, to determine the presence of nerve damage.\n• Eye examinations:\n• Complete eye examination: examination of the eyelids, blink rate, presence of inflammatory reactions and secretions, corneal epithelial alterations.\n• Corneal sensitivity test: performed by placing a cotton wad or cotton thread in contact with the corneal surface: this only allows to determine whether corneal sensitivity is normal, reduced or absent; or using an esthesiometer that allows to assess corneal sensitivity.\n• Tear film function test, such as Schirmer's test, and tear film break-up time.\n• Fluorescein eye stain test, which shows any damage to the corneal and conjunctival epithelium",
    "Treatment": "Early diagnosis, targeted treatment according to the severity of the disease, and regular monitoring of patients with neurotrophic keratitis are critical to prevent damage progression and the occurrence of corneal ulcers, especially considering that the deterioration of the condition is often poorly symptomatic.[21]\nThe purpose of treatment is to prevent the progression of corneal damage and promote healing of the corneal epithelium. The treatment should always be personalized according to the severity of the disease. Conservative treatment is typically the best option.[citation needed]\nIn stage I, the least serious, treatment consists of the administration of preservative-free artificial tears several times a day in order to lubricate and protect the ocular surface, improving the quality of the epithelium and preventing the possible loss of transparency of the cornea.[citation needed]\nIn stage II, treatment should be aimed at preventing the development of corneal ulcers and promoting the healing of epithelial lesions. In addition to artificial tears, topical antibiotics may also be prescribed to prevent possible infections. Patients should be monitored very carefully since, being the disease poorly symptomatic, the corneal damage may progress without the patient noticing any worsening of the symptoms. Corneal contact lenses can also be used in this stage of the disease, for their protective action to improve corneal healing.[22]\nIn the most severe forms (stage III), it is necessary to stop the progression towards corneal perforation: in these cases, a possible surgical treatment option is tarsorrhaphy, i.e. the temporary or permanent closure of the eyelids by means of sutures or botulinum toxin injection. This protects the cornea, although the aesthetic result of these procedures may be difficult to accept for patients. Similarly, a procedure that entails the creation of a conjunctival flap has been shown to be effective in the treatment of chronic corneal ulcers with or without corneal perforation.[23]\nIn addition, another viable therapeutic option is amniotic membrane graft, which has recently been shown to play a role in stimulating corneal epithelium healing and in reducing vascularisation and inflammation of the ocular surface.[24] Other approaches used in severe forms include the administration of autologous serum eye drops.[25]\nResearch studies have focused on developing novel treatments for neurotrophic keratitis, and several  polypeptides, growth factors and neuromediators have been proposed.[26] Studies were conducted on topical treatment with Substance P and IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor-1), demonstrating an effect on epithelial healing.[27] Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) play a role in the epithelial proliferation and differentiation and in the survival of corneal sensory nerves. Topical treatment with murine NGF showed to promote recovery of epithelial integrity and corneal sensitivity in NK patients.[28] Recently, a recombinant human nerve growth factor eye drop formulation has been developed for clinical use.[29]\nCenegermin, a recombinant form of human NGF, has recently been approved in Europe in an eye drop formulation for neurotrophic keratitis.[30]\nCenegermin as an eye drop formulation for treatment of NK is approved by FDA in August 2018",

    "Disease": "Neutral lipid storage disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "N/A",
    "Cause": "Neutral lipid storage disease is caused by the abnormal and excessive accumulation of lipids in certain bodily tissues, including the liver, the heart, and muscle.[4] Normally, these lipids are stored as lipid droplets and are normally used for metabolism, cell signaling and trafficking of vesicles.[2] Neutral lipid storage disease is a disease that is diagnosed with the simultaneous occurrence of myopathy and/or  ichthyosis. Myopathy is defined as a disease of the muscle tissue. Ichthyosis is a skin related disease in which the skin becomes very scaly, thick, and dry.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "Main physical signs include a fatty liver, a weakened and enlarged heart (cardiomyopathy), inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), reduced thyroid activity (hypothyroidism), type 2 diabetes, abnormal levels of creatine kinase in blood, and increased weakness of proximal muscles due to fatty replacement of skeletal muscle fibers. Accurate diagnosis is complicated by symptomatic overlap with other disorders. One of the earliest symptoms to manifest clinically is peripheral limb weakness, which becomes progressively more severe over time.[9] Specifically, asymmetric right shoulder weakness is an idiosyncratic hallmark of NLSD enabling it to be distinguished from myopathies arising from alternative muscular disorders.[9]\nNLSD is often diagnosed by the presence of lipid inclusions within leukocytes (Jordans' anomaly),[9] which can be detected using histology and electron microscopy.[2]\nClassically, NLSD is associated with myopathy and can, in some cases, be linked with ichthyosis. Therefore, with these symptoms or diagnosis, it is likely that the patient could and would be diagnosed with NLSD.[10]\nAlthough lipid accumulation is most prominent in myocytes, hepatocytes, and granulocytes, other tissues displayed elevated deposits as well. For the purpose of diagnosis, MRIs have been used to identify large fat deposits within muscle tissue.[9]\nPeople can live with NLSD, but there can be complications due to the effects this disease has on other major parts of the body like the liver, the heart, and skeletal muscle, although myopathy won't necessarily show up until a patient is in the third decade of their life,[11] a child born with ichthyosis, is immediately evaluated for NLSD, in which it is detected very early on. Also, the earlier that NLSD can be detected and symptoms treated, the better quality of life the patient can have.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Although there is no current treatment to correct the abnormal metabolic processes underlying this disease, there are approaches to ameliorate symptoms and decrease the effects of this disease. Because there is an increase of fat storage and a decrease in fat catabolism, low fat diets are recommended for slowing the progression of the disease, including the onset of type 2 diabetes and hypothyroidism. In addition, diets containing triglycerides composed of short chain fatty acids are more beneficial than TGAs containing long chain fatty acids. Ketone bodies can be rapidly transported, catabolized, and used by many tissues including the brain. Medium-chain fatty acids in an individual's diet are rapidly used by the body, limiting storage and therefore alleviating lipid droplet accumulation. Foods with medium-chain fatty acids include dairy, fat and coconut oil. Supplements can also be taken to increase uptake of these fatty acids. Triaheptanoin, a triglyceride containing three seven-carbon chain fatty acids, has also been proposed as a possible dietary supplement.[12] Treatment for the ichthyosis is limited; moisturizers are commonly used to help manage dry, flaky, itchy skin.[citation needed]",

Traditional screening tests utilized for congenital disorders of glycosylation, including carbohydrate deficient transferrin are not diagnostic in NGLY1 deficiency.  To date all variants identified as being causative of NGLY1 deficiency have been sequence variants, rather than copy number variants.  This spectrum may change as additional cases are identified.[2]  A common nonsense variant (c.1201A>T (p.Arg401Ter)) accounts for approximately a third of pathogenic variants identified, and is associated with a more severe clinical course.[2]\nThere is also a biomarker for NGLY1 deficiency.[5][6] When the NGLY1 protein is missing or not functioning correctly, a specific molecule called GlcNAc-Asn (GNA) accumulates. GNA is elevated in individuals with NGLY1 deficiency compared to individuals without the disease.[6][5] Elevated GNA alone is not enough to confirm an NGLY1 deficiency diagnosis, but in combination with molecular genetic testing and clinical findings, it can provides additional support for NGLY1 deficiency.",
    "Treatment": "There is no cure for NGLY1 deficiency.[7]  Supportive care is indicated for each patient based on their specific symptoms, and can include eye drops to manage the alacrima, pharmaceutical management of seizures, feeding therapy and physical therapy.[2]  Most potential treatment options for NGLY1 deficiency are in the pre-clinical stages.

Enlargement of the liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly) may cause reduced appetite, abdominal distension, and pain. Enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) may also cause low levels of platelets in the blood (thrombocytopenia).[citation needed]\nAccumulation of sphingomyelin in the central nervous system (including the cerebellum) results in unsteady gait (ataxia), slurring of speech (dysarthria), and difficulty swallowing (dysphagia). Basal ganglia dysfunction causes abnormal posturing of the limbs, trunk, and face (dystonia). Upper brainstem disease results in impaired voluntary rapid eye movements (supranuclear gaze palsy). More widespread disease involving the cerebral cortex and subcortical structures causes gradual loss of intellectual abilities, causing dementia and seizures.[citation needed]\nBones also may be affected, with the disease-causing enlarged bone marrow cavities, thinned cortical bone, or a distortion of the hip bone called coxa vara. Sleep-related disorders also occur with the condition, such as sleep inversion, sleepiness during the day and wakefulness at night. Gelastic cataplexy, the sudden loss of muscle tone when the affected patient laughs, is also seen.[citation needed]",
    "Cause": "Mutations in the SMPD1 gene cause Niemann–Pick disease types A and B. They produce a deficiency in the activity of the lysosomal enzyme acid sphingomyelinase, that breaks down the lipid sphingomyelin.[3]\nMutations in NPC1 or NPC2 cause Niemann–Pick disease, type C (NPC), which affects a protein used to transport lipids.[3]\nType D originally was separated from type C to delineate a group of patients with otherwise identical disorders who shared a common Nova Scotian ancestry. Patients in this group are known to share a specific mutation in the NPC1 gene, so NPC is used for both groups. Before the molecular defects were described, the terms \"Niemann–Pick type I\" and \"Niemann–Pick type II\" were proposed to separate the high- and low-sphingomyelin forms of the disease in the early 1980s.[citation needed]\nNiemann–Pick disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern,[4][5] which means both copies or both alleles of the gene, must be defective to cause the disease. \"Defective\" means they are altered in a way that impairs their function. Most often, the parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are carriers: they have one copy of the altered gene but are not affected because the other copy produces the enzyme. If both parents are carriers, each pregnancy has a 25% chance of producing an affected child. Genetic counseling and genetic testing are recommended for families who may be carriers of the disease.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "For types A and B, levels of sphingomyelinase can be measured from a blood sample. To diagnose type C, a skin sample can help determine whether the transporter is affected via the Filipin test which detects build-up of unesterified cholesterol via fluorescent staining.[6][7]",

Neurotoxicologist Peter Spencer, who has investigated the disease, has stated that upon presentation with food, \"one or two [children] will start nodding very rapidly in a continuous, pendulous nod. A nearby child may suddenly go into a tonic–clonic seizure, while others will freeze.\"[7] Severe seizures can cause the child to collapse, causing injury.[8] Sub-clinical seizures have been identified in electroencephalograms, and MRI scans have shown brain atrophy and damage to the hippocampus and glia cells.[4]\nIt has been found that no seizures occur when affected individuals are given an unfamiliar or non-traditional food, such as chocolate.[6][8][9]",
    "Cause": "As of 2024[update] the cause of the disease was not known,[2] but a link has been found between nodding syndrome, infestation by the parasitic worm Onchocerca volvulus prevalent in all outbreak areas, and exposure to black-fly bites which transmit it.[10][2] A possible explanation involves the formation of antibodies against parasite antigen that are cross-reactive to leiomodin-1 in the central nervous system.[11] O. volvulus, a nematode, is carried by the black fly and causes river blindness. In 2004, most children with nodding disease lived close to the Yei River, a hotbed for river blindness, and 93.7% of those with nodding disease were found to harbour the parasite — a far higher percentage than in children without the disease.[12] A link between river blindness and normal cases of epilepsy,[13] as well as retarded growth,[14] had been proposed previously, although the evidence for this link is inconclusive.[15] Of the connection between the worm and the disease, Scott Dowell, the lead investigator into the syndrome for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), stated: \"We know that [Onchocerca volvulus] is involved in some way, but it is a little puzzling because [the worm] is fairly common in areas that do not have nodding disease\".[10] Andrea Winkler, the first author of a 2008 Tanzanian study, has said of the connection: \"We could not establish any hint that Onchocerca volvulus is actually going into the brain, but what we cannot exclude is that there is an autoimmune mechanism going on.\"[4] In the most severely affected region of Uganda, infection with microfilariae in epileptic or nodding children ranged from 70% to 100%.[16]\nIn 2011 the CDC was investigating a possible connection with wartime chemical exposure, and whether a deficiency in vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) could be a cause, noting the seizures of pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy and this common deficiency in those with the disease.[4] Older theories include a 2002 toxicology report that postulated a connection with tainted monkey meat, as well as the eating of agricultural seeds provided by relief agencies that were covered in toxic chemicals.[6]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is not very advanced and is based on the telltale nodding seizures of the patients. When stunted growth and mental disability are also present, probability of nodding syndrome is high. In the future, neurological scans may also be used in diagnosis.[17]",
    "Treatment": "N/A",
    "Management": "As of 2024[update] no cure was known for the disease,[2] so treatment has been directed at symptoms, and has included the use of anticonvulsants used to treat epilepsy such as sodium valproate[10] and phenobarbitol. Anti-malaria drugs have also been administered, to unknown effect.[7] Nutritional deficiencies may also be present."

    "Cause": "The possible causes of non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder are 2-fold: (1), extrinsic: isolation from daily light cycles (such as working in an environment completely devoid of natural lighting);[citation needed] and (2), intrinsic: where some condition, such as blindness or malfunctioning biochemical response to light in the subject, prevent normal levels of light-activated melatonin release.[citation needed] Melatonin is responsible for sleep regulation, and its release is controlled by the amount of light entering the eyes.[16]",

    "Disease": "Norrie disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "N/A",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "Norrie disease and other NDP related diseases are diagnosed with the combination of clinical findings and molecular genetic testing. Molecular genetic testing identifies the mutations that cause the disease in about 95% of affected males.[2] Clinical diagnoses rely on ocular findings. Norrie disease is diagnosed when grayish-yellow fibrovascular masses are found behind the eye from birth through three months. Doctors also look for progression of the disease from three months through 8–10 years of age. Some of these progressions include cataracts, iris atrophy, shallowing of anterior chamber, and shrinking of the globe.[2] Children with the condition either have only light perception or no vision at all.[citation needed]\nIn addition to its use for initial diagnosis, molecular genetic testing is used to confirm diagnostic testing (such as diagnosis by ocular examination), for carrier testing females, prenatal diagnosis, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis. There are three types of clinical molecular genetic testing. In approximately 95% of males, mis-sense and splice mutations of the NDP gene and partial or whole gene deletions are detected using sequence analysis.[2] Deletion/duplication analysis can be used to detect the 15% of mutations that are submicroscopic deletions. This is also used when testing for carrier females. The last testing used is linkage analysis, which is used when the first two types are unavailable. Linkage analysis is also recommended for those families who have more than one member affected by the disease.[2]\nMRI is often used to diagnose the retinal dysplasia that occurs with the Norrie disease. However, the retinal dysplasia can be indistinguishable on MRI from persistent fetal vasculature, or the dysplasia of trisomy 13 and Walker–Warburg syndrome.[25]\nFor families with an existing history of Norrie disease, genetic counselling and in utero diagnosis of Norrie disease may be considered.[26] In utero diagnosis has been reported to include genetic testing by amniocentesis and ultrasonography to examine fetal eyes. Confirmation of diagnosis on the first day of life by ophthalmological examination under anesthesia has also been reported in some cases.[26][27]",
    "Treatment": "N/A",
    "Management": "Ocular, auditory and behavioral management are the most common areas of intervention and treatment for patients with Norrie disease. For ocular (eye) management, often patients already have complete retinal detachment at birth, or by the time of diagnosis, so surgical intervention is often not offered. However, there is some evidence for the benefit of early surgery or laser therapy for cases where retinal detachment is incomplete.[2][27][28] Surgery may also be used to treat increased intraocular pressure and in rare cases enucleation (removal) of the eye is considered to control pain.[2]\nA high proportion (85–90%) of individuals with Norrie disease experience progressive hearing loss in their second decade of life. In most cases, use of hearing aids has been shown to be effective into middle or late adulthood. For more significantly impaired hearing, cochlear implants may also be considered.[2][9][18]\n30–50% of individuals with Norrie disease have been reported to present with developmental delay or cognitive impairment. Additionally, behavioral issues have also been reported. Supportive intervention and therapy, for example working with speech and language therapists and occupational therapists, can be used to maximize educational opportunities for these individuals.[2]\nRoutine monitoring of individuals with Norrie disease is recommended to best manage the disease. This includes regular follow-up with an ophthalmologist, even when vision is severely compromised. Additionally, due to the high proportion of individuals with Norrie disease who develop hearing loss, regular monitoring of hearing loss is beneficial to allow any hearing loss to be detected early and then correctly managed.[2] More recently, the use of dual sensory clinics has been proposed to provide improved care to patients living with conditions such as Norrie disease. For example, Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH), London are building a new Sight and Sound center, with the aim of improving the patient experience for individuals with conditions such as Norrie disease.[29]\nIndividuals with Norrie disease can often feel isolated from society due to difficulties in communication. In cases where hearing loss is also experienced, this psychological burden has been shown to increase. For example, a number of Norrie disease patients have been reported to experience transient depression correlating with the onset of hearing loss.[9] Because of this, the provision of emotional support to individuals with Norrie disease can be as important as clinical treatment strategies in terms of improving their quality of life and reducing disease burden.[citation needed]"

Additionally, a distinction between OPMD and myasthenia gravis or mitochondrial myopathy must be made, in regards to the differential diagnosis of this condition.[2]",
    "Treatment": "Currently, no cure or specific treatment exists to eliminate the symptoms or stop the disease progression. A consistent diet planned with the help of a dietitian along with exercises taught by a speech therapist can assist with mild symptoms of dysphagia. Surgical intervention can also help temporarily manage symptoms related to ptosis and dysphagia. Cutting one of the throat muscles internally, an operation called cricopharyngeal myotomy, can be one way to ease symptoms in more severe cases. However, for most people, the benefits from such treatments are only temporary. There is currently no treatment available to address the proximal limb weakness. Many of those affected with proximal limb weakness will eventually require assistive devices such as canes, braces, or a wheelchair. As with all surgical procedures, they come with many risk factors.[9][10] As the dysphagia becomes more severe, patients become malnourished, lose significant weight, become dehydrated and suffer from repeated incidents of aspiration pneumonia.

There is also delayed closing of fontanelle, and the boys also have broad great toes. Skin is characterized by redundancy or laxity with minimal subcutaneous fat, cutaneous capillary malformations, and very fine hair and eyebrows. Death resulted from cardiogenic shock following arrhythmia, which was noted in all affected individuals.

The boys were never able to sit up on their own, and none learned how to talk.[2] They all had a characteristically aged appearance, earning them the family nickname of \"little old men.\"[2] Several of the boys had structural anomalies of their hearts including ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, and pulmonary artery stenosis.

    "Disease": "Ollier disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "N/A",
    "Cause": "For many years, most research has been inconclusive regarding the cause of the disease.[1][17]\nRecent studies have shown that most cases of Ollier disease are believed to have been caused by isocitrate dehydrogenases IDH1 and IDH2 mutations.[18] In one study, 35 of 43 (81%) patients with Ollier disease had either a IDH1 or IDH2 mutation.[19] Another study suggests that R132C IDH1 mutations which are particularly dominant at exon 4 of IDH genes are linked to the growth of vascular lesions.[15] Isocitrate deyhydrogenases IDH1 and IDH2 are catalysts responsible for the conversion of isocitrate to 2-oxoglutarate. The isocitrate deyhydrogenases IDH1 and IDH2 mutations disrupt this process resulting in unregulated production of α-ketoglutarate and a reduction in chondrocyte proliferation. In many cases of cartilaginous tumors, IDH1 and IDH2 point mutations were found thus explaining why Ollier disease is associated with many different associated conditions. Based on these case studies, most evidence suggests that the abnormal lining of lesions found in Ollier disease would suggest that the condition is caused by a post-zygotic somatic mutation thus resulting in a mosaic genetic disorder.[20]\nApproximately 8–10% of cases of patients with Ollier disease have been linked to PTH1R mutations.[17][19] A particular case study the mutant heterozygous PTHR1 (R150C) receptor was observed in two unrelated patients with Ollier disease.[21][22] This PTHR1 (R150C) mutant causes a reduction in chondrocyte differentiation by triggering the PTHrP-dependent pathway and decreasing PTHLH receptor function by approximately 30% creating enchondromas. One of these patients with the PTHR1 (R150C) mutant was found to have inherited the mutation from his father. This provides credence to the theory that multiple genetic mutations are needed to occur in order for Ollier disease to manifest.\nAn alternative theory suggests that since there have been cases of multiple family members with enchondromatosis, the disorder may be passed on through autosomal dominant inheritance.[1]",
    "Diagnosis": "Clinical and radiological evaluations are conducted in order to detect the presence of bone neoplasms or lesions typically found in Ollier disease. Histological evaluations are mainly used to examine or detect malignancies.\nAbnormal bone growth such as shortening or thickening and deformity may be observed in patients of Ollier disease. These bone lesions are visible at birth using radiography but are usually not screened or examined for until clinical manifestations present during early childhood.  However, some patients may exhibit no signs of any symptoms.[1] One study found thirteen to be the mean age of diagnosis in patients with Ollier disease. In an X-ray, there would normally be the presence of several homogeneous lesions of an oval or elongated shape with bone edges that are slightly thickened.[3] With age, these lesions may calcify and appear as diffusely minute spots or stippled. Fan-like septations or streaks would be indicative of the presence of several enchondromas. Early detection and consistent and repeated monitoring is important in order to prevent and treat any potential bone neoplasms.[citation needed]\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, and scintigraphy are generally not practical for diagnostic purposes. X-rays are not as effective in the monitoring or evaluation of enchondromas due to frequent localized changes also sometimes due to the large number of enchondromas. MRI can sometimes however be used to monitor and evaluate symptomatic lesions in the case of potential malignant transformations.\nSimilar disorders such as Maffucci syndrome and hereditary multiple exostoses (HME) require differentiation during diagnosis. Maffucci syndrome can be distinguished clinically by the presence of hemangiomas and lymphangiomas and genetically through R132C IDH1 hotspot mutations.[15] HME features osteochondromas which are near the surface the bone whereas enchondromas featured in Ollier disease and Maffucci are more towards the center of the bone.[3] Also, neural compressions are more commonly found in HME than in Ollier disease.",
    "Treatment": "The condition of Ollier disease cannot be treated for but the complications that arise such as fractures, growth defects, and tumors can be surgically treated. These are typically done to treat and remove any extraneous bone tissue while preserving the function of limb if possible.[11]\nFractures have been treated using a variety of methods such as bone grafting, internal fixation, corticoplasty, Ilizarov technique, elastic stable intramedullary nailing system (ESIN), and flexible intramedullary nailing (FIN).\nCorticoplasty has been shown to have success in treating hand lesions and deformities while retaining normal function.[23][24] The surgery utilizes the removal of tissue (curettage) and bone reconstruction in order to remove enchondromas and improve cosmetic appearance. Many cases of corticoplasty have been shown improvement in appearances while maintaining function. Recurrence of enchondromas was observed in some cases. In cases of Ollier disease, early surgical treatment of enchondromas in the hand is recommended.\nThe Ilizarov technique is a form of noninvasive treatment that can sometimes be used to reshape and correct deformities and misaligned limb bones.[25][26] It uses the process of external fixation through the scaffolding of pins or wires into the bone in an attempt to transform enchondromata into normal bone tissue. This method of treatment is very safe but is also very strenuous as it a long-term procedure. The ring fixators used in the Ilizarov technique have been shown to be very versatile for realigning and lengthening limb bones while also managing soft tissue tension.[27] Complications from this procedure may include a recurrence in limb lengthening complications such as premature healing requiring osteoclasis and a return of angular deformities. Reduced latency periods followed by faster distraction times are encouraged in order to prevent premature healing. The Ilizarov technique has shown to have positive outcomes for many cases of Ollier disease with some patients even experiencing full correction of deformity and length in best cases scenarios.\nElastic stable intramedullary nailing system (ESIN) and flexible intramedullary nailing (FIN) are more recent surgical procedures that utilize internal fixation that has been shown to reduce the Healing Index and minimize complications.[28][29] Similarly to the Ilizarov technique, the procedure is intended to correct deformities and elongate limb bones. This form of treatment is not suitable for the elongation of bones with a small shaft diameter or sections containing open growth zones. Patients with severe forms of Ollier disease also are not suited for surgery because of an increased risk of complications due to bone frame instability. Both the elastic stable intramedullary nailing system (ESIN) and flexible intramedullary nailing (FIN) use two bent elastic nails in order to allow for greater realignment and stability. This technique used in conjunction with a circular external fixator has been shown to significantly reduce Healing Index values in both monosegmental and polysegmental lengthening. Another advantage is that no fractures or deformities were found in later follow ups of 2 to 5 years.\nElastic stable intramedullary nailing system (ESIN) requires a longer duration of external fixation for most procedures compared to flexible intramedullary nailing (FIN).[citation needed]\nMalignant transformations of any or multiple enchondromas are common in patients with Ollier disease and typically emerge in young adults often requiring surgery. The average age of patients of Ollier disease for their first surgery to treat their chondrosarcoma is thirty-three. Some examples of surgical procedures performed to treat secondary malignant bone neoplasms from Ollier disease include amputation, wide-local excisions, hemipelvectomy, and arthroplasty.[30] Cobalt and chemotherapy are typically not primary methods of surgery as chondrosarcomas generally do not have enough blood supply to make it an effective form of treatment.[31] These are done to treat and remove any extraneous bone tissue while preserving the function of limb if possible.[11]",

Abnormalities in the larynx, trachea and esophagus can cause significant difficulty breathing and/or swallowing and can result in reoccurring pneumonia and life-threatening situations. Commonly, there may be a gap between the trachea and esophagus, referred to as a laryngeal cleft; which can allow food or fluid to enter the airway and make breathing and eating a difficult task.[5]\nGenital abnormalities like a urinary opening under the penis (hypospadias), undescended testes (cryptorchidism), underdeveloped scrotum and a scrotum divided into two lobes (bifid scrotum) can all be commonplace for males with the disease.[6]\nDevelopmental delays of the brain and nervous system are also common in both types I and II of the disease.[7] 50% of people with Opitz G/BBB Syndrome will experience developmental delay and mild intellectual disability. This can impact motor skills, speech and learning capabilities. Some of these instances are likened to autistic spectrum disorders. Close to half of the people with Opitz G/BBB Syndrome also have a cleft lip (hole in the lip opening) and possibly a cleft palate (hole in the roof of the mouth), as well. Less than half of the people diagnosed have heart defects, imperforate anus (obstructed anal opening), and brain defects.[8] Of all the impairments, female carriers of X-linked Type I Opitz G/BBB Syndrome usually only have ocular hypertelorism.[9]",
    "Cause": "Opitz G/BBB Syndrome is a rare genetic condition caused by one of two major types of mutations: MID1 mutation on the short (p) arm of the X chromosome or a mutation of the 22q11.2 gene on the 22nd chromosome.[10]",
    "Diagnosis": "X-linked type I Opitz G/BBB Syndrome is diagnosed on clinical findings, but those findings can vary greatly: even within the same family. Manifestations of X-linked type I are classified in the frequent/major findings and minor findings that are found in less than 50% of individuals.[14]\nThe three major findings that suggest a person has X-linked Type I Opitz G/BBB Syndrome:\n• Ocular hypertelorism (~100% cases)\n• Hypospadias (85-90% cases)\n• Laryngotracheoesophageal abnormalities (60-70%)\nMinor findings found in less than 50% of individuals:\n• Intellectual disability\n• Cleft lip/palate\n• Congenital heart defects\n• Imperforate (blocked) anus\n• Brain defects (especially corpus callosum)\n[15]\nIn 1989, Hogdall used ultrasonographs to diagnose X-linked Type I Opitz G/BBB Syndrome after 19 weeks of pregnancy, by identifying hypertelorism (widely-spaced eyes) and hypospadias (irregular urinary tract openings in the penis).[16]\nThere is also molecular genetic testing available to identify mutations leading to Opitz G/BBB Syndrome. X-linked Type I testing must be done on MID1, since this is the only gene that is known to cause Type I Opitz G/BBB Syndrome. Two different tests can be performed: sequence analysis and deletion/duplication analysis Archived 2020-10-30 at the Wayback Machine. In the sequence analysis a positive result would detect 15-50% of the DNA sequence mutated, while a deletion/duplication positive result would find deletion or duplication of one or more exons of the entire MID1 gene.[17]",
    "Treatment": "Because the variability of this disease is so great and the way that it reveals itself could be multi-faceted; once diagnosed, a multidisciplinary team is recommended to treat the disease and should include a craniofacial surgeon, ophthalmologist, pediatrician, pediatric urologist, cardiologist, pulmonologist, speech pathologist, and a medical geneticist. Several important steps must be followed, as well.[citation needed]\n• Past medical history\n• Physical examination with special attention to size and measurements of facial features, palate, heart, genitourinary system and lower respiratory system\n• Eye evaluation\n• Hypospadias assessment by urologist\n• Laryngoscopy and chest x-ray for difficulties with breathing/swallowing\n• Cleft lip/palate assessment by craniofacial surgeon\n• Assessment of standard age developmental and intellectual abilities\n• Anal position assessment\n• Echocardiogram\n• Cranial imaging\nMany surgical repairs may be needed, as assessed by professionals. Furthermore, special education therapies and psychoemotional therapies may be required, as well. In some cases, antireflux drugs can be prescribed until risk of breathing and swallowing disorders are removed. Genetic counseling is highly advised to help explain who else in the family may be at risk for the disease and to help guide family planning decisions in the future.[19]\nBecause of its wide variability in which defects will occur, there is no known mortality rate specifically for the disease. However, the leading cause of death for people with Opitz G/BBB syndrome is due to infant death caused by aspiration due to esophageal, pharyngeal or laryngeal defects.[20]\nFortunately, to date there are no factors that can increase the expression of symptoms of this disease. All abnormalities and symptoms are present at birth.[21]\nSince the symptoms caused by this disease are present at birth, there is no “cure.” The best cure that scientists are researching is awareness and genetic testing to determine risk factors and increase knowledgeable family planning. Prevention is the only option at this point in time for a cure.",

    "Disease": "Osteochondritis dissecans",
    "Signs and symptoms": "In osteochondritis dissecans, fragments of cartilage or bone become loose within a joint, leading to pain and inflammation. These fragments are sometimes referred to as joint mice.[7] OCD is a type of osteochondrosis in which a lesion has formed within the cartilage layer itself, giving rise to secondary inflammation. OCD most commonly affects the knee, although it can affect other joints such as the ankle or the elbow.[8]\nPeople with OCD report activity-related pain that develops gradually. Individual complaints usually consist of mechanical symptoms including pain, swelling, catching, locking, popping noises, and buckling / giving way; the primary presenting symptom may be a restriction in the range of movement.[9] Symptoms typically present within the initial weeks of stage I. The onset of stage II occurs within months and offers little time for diagnosis. The disease progresses rapidly beyond stage II, as OCD lesions quickly move from stable cysts or fissures to unstable fragments. Non-specific symptoms, caused by similar injuries such as sprains and strains, can delay a definitive diagnosis.[10]\nPhysical examination typically reveals fluid in the joint, tenderness, and crepitus. The tenderness may initially spread, but often reverts to a well-defined focal point as the lesion progresses. Just as OCD shares symptoms with common maladies, acute osteochondral fracture has a similar presentation with tenderness in the affected joint, but is usually associated with a fatty hemarthrosis. Although there is no significant pathologic gait or characteristic alignment abnormality associated with OCD, the patient may walk with the involved leg externally rotated in an attempt to avoid tibial spine impingement on the lateral aspect of the medial condyle of the femur.[11]",

    "Diagnosis": "To diagnose osteochondritis dissecans, an X-ray, CT scan or MRI scan can be performed to show necrosis of subchondral bone, formation of loose fragments, or both.[30] Occasionally a nuclear medicine bone scan is used to assess the degree of loosening within the joint.[31]",

    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is mainly based upon delineating the specific clinical and radiographic pattern of skeletal involvement. However, the different types of skeletal dysplasia can overlap considerably in their clinical presentation. Molecular or genetic analysis may be required to resolve diagnostic difficulties.[4][20]",
    "Treatment": "Emerging therapies for genetic skeletal dysplasias include enzyme replacement therapy,[23] small molecule therapy,[24] hematopoietic stem cell transplantation[25][26] and gene therapy. These therapies aim at preventing disease progression and thus improving quality of life. Enzyme replacement therapies are some of the mucopolysaccharidoses[23] and Gaucher disease.[27] Results have shown effectivity of enzyme replacement therapy. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can be lifesaving for some disorders, such as with malignant infantile osteopetrosis.[25][26]\nEven with treatments such as enzyme replacement therapy and stem cell transplantation, people with skeletal dysplasia often require orthopedic surgery and other disease management interventions. There is a lack of information available to support these patients as most physicians may only see one or two skeletal dysplasia patients in their lifetime. Guidelines are available to support best practices for managing several areas of skeletal dysplasia, such as the craniofacial aspects of skeletal dysplasia,[5] spinal disorders,[5] diagnosis and management of type II collagen disorders,[22] pregnancy of people with skeletal dysplasia,[28] peri-operative management,[29] and foramen magnum stenosis in achondroplasia.[30] Written and video resources for patients with skeletal dysplasia and caregivers are also available.",

In severe OI, signs on medical imaging include abnormalities in all extremities and the spine.[97] As X-rays are often insensitive to the comparatively smaller bone density loss associated with type I OI, DEXA scans may be needed.[5]: 1514\nAn OI diagnosis can be confirmed through DNA or collagen protein analysis, but in many cases, the occurrence of bone fractures with little trauma and the presence of other clinical features such as blue sclerae are sufficient for a diagnosis. A skin biopsy can be performed to determine the structure and quantity of type I collagen. While DNA testing can confirm the diagnosis, it cannot absolutely exclude it because not all mutations causing OI are yet known and/or tested for.[83]: 491–492  OI type II is often diagnosed by ultrasound during pregnancy, where already multiple fractures and other characteristic features may be visible. Relative to control, OI cortical bone shows increased porosity, canal diameter, and connectivity in micro-computed tomography.[98] OI can also be detected before birth by using an in vitro genetic testing technique such as amniocentesis.[99]",
    "Treatment": "There is no cure for osteogenesis imperfecta.[10] Maintaining a healthy lifestyle by exercising and avoiding smoking can help prevent fractures.[102] Treatment may include care of broken bones, pain medication, physical therapy, mobility aids such as braces or wheelchairs, and surgery.[102]\nJudging the success or failure of treatment can be difficult in OI patients, as decreased bone fracture rates may just be coincidental. While these rates are often used in medical studies to judge treatment efficacy, a Norwegian study of fifteen people with OI emphasized that they feel doctors should consider the whole patient and not just fracture rates.[103]",

    "Disease": "Osteopetrosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Despite this excess bone formation, people with osteopetrosis tend to have bones that are more brittle than normal. Mild osteopetrosis may cause no symptoms, and present no problems.[5]\nHowever, serious forms can result in the following:[5]\n• Stunted growth, deformity, and increased likelihood of fractures\n• Patients experience anemia, recurrent infections, and hepatosplenomegaly due to bone expansion leading to bone marrow narrowing and extramedullary hematopoiesis\n• It can also result in blindness, facial paralysis, and deafness, due to the increased pressure put on the nerves by the extra bone\n• Abnormal cortical bone morphology\n• Abnormal form of the vertebral bodies\n• Abnormality of temperature regulation\n• Abnormality of the ribs\n• Abnormality of vertebral epiphysis morphology\n• Bone pain\n• Cranial nerve paralysis\n• Craniosynostosis\n• Hearing impairment\n• Hypocalcemia",
    "Cause": "The various types of osteopetrosis are caused by genetic changes (mutations) in one of at least ten genes. There is nothing a parent can do before, during or after a pregnancy to cause osteopetrosis in a child.[5]\nNormally, bone growth is a balance between osteoblasts (cells that create bone tissue) and osteoclasts (cells that destroy bone tissue). This process is necessary to keep bones strong and healthy. Those with osteopetrosis have a deficiency of osteoclasts, meaning too little bone is being resorbed, resulting in too much bone being created. The genes associated with osteopetrosis are involved in the development and/or function of osteoclasts, cells that break down bone tissue when old bone is being replaced by new bone (bone remodeling). Mutations in these genes can lead to abnormal osteoclasts(termed osteoclast-rich osteopetrosis), or having too few osteoclasts(osteoclast-poor osteopetrosis).[13] If this happens, old bone cannot be broken down as new bone is formed, so bones become too dense and prone to breaking.[5]\nThree different types of inheritance-autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive and X-linked recessive have been observed.[11]\n• Mutations in the CLCN7 gene cause most cases of autosomal dominant(in a dominant negative manner) osteopetrosis, 10-15% of cases of autosomal recessive osteopetrosis (the most severe form), and all known cases of intermediate autosomal osteopetrosis.\n• Mutations in the TCIRG1 gene cause about 50% of cases of AR(autosomal recessive) osteopetrosis.\n• Mutations in the IKBKG gene cause X-linked osteopetrosis.\n• Mutations in the CA-II gene can be an extremely rare cause of AR osteopetrosis in the setting of renal defects.\n• Mutations in the RANKL gene cause AR osteoclast-poor osteopetrosis.\n• Mutations in other genes are less common causes of osteopetrosis.[13]\n• In about 30% percent of affected people, the cause is unknown.[14]",
    "Diagnosis": "The differential diagnosis of osteopetrosis includes other disorders that produce osteosclerosis. They constitute a wide array of disorders with clinically and radiologically diverse manifestations. Among the differential diagnosis are hereditary ostoesclerosing dysplasias such as; neuropathic infantile osteopetrosis, infantile osteopetrosis with renal tubular acidosis, infantile osteopetrosis with immunodeficiency, infantile osteopetrosis with leukocyte adhesion deficiency syndrome (LAD-III), pyknodysostosis (osteopetrosis acro-osteolytica), osteopoikilosis (Buschke–Ollendorff syndrome), osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis, mixed sclerosing skeletal dysplasias, progressive diaphyseal dysplasia (Camurati–Engelmann disease), SOST-related sclerosing skeletal dysplasias.[7] Besides, the differential diagnosis includes acquired conditions that induce osteosclerosis such as osteosclerotic metastasis notably carcinomas of the prostate gland and breast, Paget's disease of bone, myelofibrosis (primary disorder or secondary to intoxication or malignancy), Erdheim–Chester disease, osteosclerosing types of osteomyelitis, sickle cell disease, hypervitaminosis D, and hypoparathyroidism.[20]",
    "Treatment": "It was the first genetic disease treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (osteoclasts are derived from hematopoietic precursors).[21][22] There is no cure, although curative therapy with bone marrow transplantation is being investigated in clinical trials. It is believed the healthy marrow will provide cells from which osteoclasts will develop.[5] If complications occur in children, patients can be treated with vitamin D. Gamma interferon has also been shown to be effective, and it can be associated to vitamin D. Erythropoetin has been used to treat any associated anemia. Corticosteroids may alleviate both the anemia and stimulate bone resorption. Fractures and osteomyelitis can be treated as usual.[5] Treatment for osteopetrosis depends on the specific symptoms present and the severity in each person. Therefore, treatment options must be evaluated on an individual basis. Nutritional support is important to improve growth and it also enhances responsiveness to other treatment options. A calcium-deficient diet has been beneficial for some affected people.[5]\nTreatment is necessary for the infantile form:[5]\n• Vitamin D (calcitriol) appears to stimulate dormant osteoclasts, which stimulates bone resorption\n• Gamma interferon can have long-term benefits. It improves white blood cell function (leading to fewer infections), decreases bone volume, and increases bone marrow volume.\n• Erythropoietin can be used for anemia, and corticosteroids can be used for anemia and to stimulate bone resorption.\nBone marrow transplantation (BMT) improves some cases of severe, infantile osteopetrosis associated with bone marrow failure, and offers the best chance of longer-term survival for individuals with this type.[5]\nIn pediatric (childhood) osteopetrosis, surgery is sometimes needed because of fractures. Adult osteopetrosis typically does not require treatment, but complications of the condition may require intervention. Surgery may be needed for aesthetic or functional reasons (such as multiple fractures, deformity, and loss of function), or for severe degenerative joint disease.[5]",

These symptoms are increased (and sometimes induced) in cold environments. For example, some patients have reported that eating ice cream leads to a stiffening of the throat. For other patients, exercise consistently induces symptoms of myotonia or weakness. Typical presentations of this are during squatting or repetitive fist clenching. Some patients also indicate that specific foods are able to induce symptoms of paramyotonia congenita. Isolated cases have reported that carrots and watermelon are able to induce these symptoms. The canonical definition of this disorder precludes permanent weakness in the definition of this disorder. In practice, however, this has not been strictly adhered to in the literature.[citation needed]",
    "Cause": "N/A",

    "Signs and symptoms": "Episodes are relatively short-lived, lasting anywhere from 5–30 minutes, and in most cases disappear completely after cessation of the physical exercise.  Most patients will experience 1 to 5 episodes per month, but some can have attacks daily.[2] The muscles most often affected are usually in the legs and feet (75% of reported cases), but the upper body muscles such as the arms, face, neck, and trunk have also been observed to be affected during the episodes of dystonia.[3] Age of onset is usually sometime in childhood, but can range from 1–30 years old.[4] In one study it was found that the mean age of onset was around 8 years. Similarly in the study, the legs were the most common affected part of the body and the attacks were reported as stiffening and cramps by those affected. During an episode of PED patients find walking nearly impossible.[5] Cerebral spinal fluid analysis showed a two-fold increase of homovanillic acid and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid immediately following exercise compared to normal levels.  This indicated that increased dopaminergic transmission could contribute to PED and other paroxysmal dyskinesias.[6] Neurological examinations, EEG, and brain imaging are all normal in PED patients.[7]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "Since the age of onset is relatively young of PED it is important to correctly diagnose this disease. The limited cases and limited knowledge of the disease makes this difficult but a few characteristics seem to be consistent. It appears that patients with PED would have normal neurological examinations and MRI but the noticeable characteristic would be in low levels of glucose in the cerebral spinal fluid due to the GLUT1 mutations.[5]",
    "Treatment": "As there appeared to be a connection with PED and mutated GLUT1 transporters a possible treatment was looking at changing patients diets. A common treatment for another disorder (GLUT1 Deficiency Syndrome) with a mutated GLUT1 transporter is the ketogenic diet. The diet is a strict 3:1 ratio of fat (3) to protein and carbohydrates (1). This diet is thought to help restore the unbalance created by the decreased amount of glucose in the brain caused by the faulty GLUT1 transporter. This diet was administered to three patients who had been screened and found to have mutation in their SLC2A genes coding for GLUT1 and were experiencing PED symptoms. All three showed benefit from this treatment and a reduction in their PED episodes. They were able to exercise and run long distances for the first time in their lives. No other studies have been performed using this diet as many patients feel the advantages of the diet do not outweigh its disadvantages.[5]\nAs some cases have noted that patients were able to alleviate or lessen their PED attacks with a sugary snack, another diet that was tried on patients was one rich in carbohydrates with additional frequent carbohydrate-containing snacks. Four patients with reported PED symptoms were put on this diet but no observable improvements were noted and in fact one patient even complained of worsening symptoms.[5]\nAdditionally it has been observed that levodopa may reduce some symptoms associated with PED.  This may demonstrate that PED is a precursor to Parkinson's disease.  Acetazolamide was beneficial to some patients, but also worsened symptoms in others.  Additionally, a modified version of the Atkin's diet helped to regulate glucose levels in the cerebrospinal fluid.[8]  Patients with PED associated with insulinomas appeared to have symptoms resolved after consuming sugary drinks.[3] Currently, there are no drugs that are particularly useful in completely curing all symptoms.[citation needed]",

    "Disease": "Paroxysmal extreme pain disorder",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The most distinctive feature of PEPD is episodic burning pain of the rectum, ocular, and mandibular regions. It should be stressed that while pain often originates or is centered in these areas, it can also spread or be diffuse in nature. Pain experienced by patients with this disorder should not be underestimated, as women with the disorder who have also given birth describe PEPD pain as worse than labor pain. Concomitant with this pain is typically flushing, often in an area associated with the pain.[1]\nDuring attacks in infants, the child often looks startled or terrified and can scream inconsolably. These attacks can be precipitated by injections, defecation, wiping of the perineum, eating, or the consumption of oral medication. When attacks occur due to such precipitation, pain and flushing are often present in the area of attack precipitation, though symptoms may also be diffuse in nature.[1]\nOther symptoms may include hypersalivation when attacks are localized in the mandibular region or leg weakness after foot trauma. A prominent non-physical symptom is tonic non-epileptic seizures. Such seizures are more common in infancy and childhood than during adulthood. In older children, inconsolable screaming usually precedes such an attack, followed by apnea, paleness, and stiffness. Such stiffness can last from seconds to a few minutes.[1]\nAttack precipitants are usually physical in nature, such as defecation, eating, or taking medicine. Some less common precipitants are micturition, coitus, and painful stimuli. There are also non-physical precipitants, such as the thought or sight of food. In general, attacks tend to occur in the precipitated area, though this is not always the case. While some individuals have described a build-up to attacks, they generally tend to be abrupt. The duration of these attacks can be from a few seconds to two hours.[1]\nPatients are largely normal between attacks. The only notable problem is constipation, likely due to apprehension of precipitating an attack. This symptom often decreases with age, likely due to coping mechanisms such as the use of stool softeners.[1]",
    "Cause": "The voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.7 is expressed in nociceptive and sympathetic neurons, where it aids in action potential creation and regulation. The mutations in this gene that have been study all alter the channel's ability to inactivate. Sodium channel inactivation is vital for the proper cessation of action potentials. The decrease in inactivation caused by these mutations, then, is expected to cause prolonged action potentials and repetitive firing. Such altered firing will cause increased pain sensation and increased sympathetic nervous system activity, producing the phenotype observed in patients with PEPD.[2]",
    "Diagnosis": "Hematological, biochemical, and metabolic investigations on blood and urine between attacks are normal, as are karyotyping and EKG recordings. EKG recordings during attacks show sinus tachycardia. CT, MRI, EMG, and nerve conduction studies produce normal results. EEG recordings are normal between attacks but show early-onset tachycardia during attacks. On the Neuropathic Pain Questionnaire, patients indicated that pain during attacks is extremely unpleasant and typically felt deep, though also superficial on occasion. Aside from presentation of typical symptoms, mutation of the gene SCN9A aids in appropriate diagnosis, as this gene is mutated in 8 of 14 studied families.[1]",
    "Treatment": "Carbamazepine is at least partly effective at reducing the number or severity of attacks in most PEPD patients. High doses of this drug may be required, perhaps explaining the lack of effect in some individuals. While other epilepsy drugs like gabapentin and topiramate have limited effect in some patients, they have not been shown to be generally effective. Opiate-derived analgesics are also largely ineffective, with only sporadic cases of beneficial effect.[1]",

The remainder mainly experience the symptoms of anemia, such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and palpitations.[5]\nA small proportion of patients report attacks of abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing and pain during swallowing, as well as erectile dysfunction in men; this occurs mainly when the breakdown of red blood cells is rapid, and is attributable to spasm of smooth muscle due to depletion of nitric oxide by red cell breakdown products.[9]\nForty percent of people with PNH develop thrombosis at some point in their illness. This is the main cause of severe complications and death in PNH. These may develop in common sites (deep vein thrombosis of the leg and resultant pulmonary embolism when these clots break off and enter the lungs), but in PNH blood clots may also form in more unusual sites: the hepatic vein (causing Budd–Chiari syndrome), the portal vein of the liver (causing portal vein thrombosis), the superior or inferior mesenteric vein (causing mesenteric ischemia) and veins of the skin. Cerebral venous thrombosis, an uncommon form of stroke, is more common in those with PNH.[5]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "Blood tests in PNH show changes consistent with intravascular hemolytic anemia: low hemoglobin, raised lactate dehydrogenase, raised bilirubin (a breakdown product of hemoglobin), and decreased levels of haptoglobin; there can be raised reticulocytes (immature red cells released by the bone marrow to replace the destroyed cells) if there is no concurrent problem with production of red cells (such as iron deficiency). The direct antiglobulin test (DAT, or direct Coombs' test) is negative, as the hemolysis of PNH is not caused by antibodies.[5] If the PNH occurs in the setting of known (or suspected) aplastic anemia, abnormal white blood cell counts and decreased platelet counts may be seen at this. In this case, anemia may be caused by insufficient red blood cell production in addition to the hemolysis.[5]\nHistorically, the sucrose lysis test, in which a patient's red blood cells are placed in low-ionic-strength solution and observed for hemolysis, was used for screening.  If this was positive, the Ham's acid hemolysis test (after Dr Thomas Ham, who described the test in 1937) was performed for confirmation.[6][12] The Ham test involves placing red blood cells in mild acid; a positive result (increased RBC fragility) indicates PNH or Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia. This is now an obsolete test for diagnosing PNH due to its low sensitivity and specificity.[citation needed]\nToday, the gold standard is flow cytometry for CD55 and CD59 on white and red blood cells.  Based on the levels of these cell proteins, erythrocytes may be classified as type I, II, or III PNH cells. Type I cells have normal levels of CD55 and CD59; type II have reduced levels; and type III have absent levels.[5] The fluorescein-labeled proaerolysin (FLAER) test is being used more frequently to diagnose PNH.  FLAER binds selectively to the glycophosphatidylinositol anchor and is more accurate in demonstrating a deficit than simply for CD59 or CD55.[6]",

    "Cause": "The fact that some people affected with this disease have circulating antinuclear antibodies in their serum supports the theory that Parry–Romberg syndrome may be an autoimmune disease, specifically a variant of localized scleroderma.[13] Several instances have been reported where more than one member of a family has been affected, prompting speculation of an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. However, there has also been at least one report of monozygotic twins in which only one of the twins was affected, casting doubt on this theory. Further, the National Organization for Rare Disorders has stated there is currently no evidence that Parry–Romberg syndrome is genetic or that it can be passed on to children.[14] Various other theories about the cause and pathogenesis have been suggested, including alterations in the peripheral sympathetic nervous system (perhaps as a result of trauma or infection involving the cervical plexus or the sympathetic trunk), as the literature reported it following sympathectomy, disorders in migration of cranial neural crest cells, or chronic cell-mediated inflammatory process of the blood vessels. It is likely that the disease results from different mechanisms in different people, with all of these factors potentially being involved.[4]",

For those who report neurological symptoms such as migraine or seizures, MRI scan of the brain is the imaging modality of choice.

    "Signs and symptoms": "The hallmark signs and symptoms of Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease include little or no movement in the arms or legs, respiratory difficulties, and characteristic horizontal movements of the eyes left to right.[citation needed]\nThe onset of Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease is usually in early infancy. The most characteristic early signs are nystagmus (rapid, involuntary, rhythmic motion of the eyes) and low muscle tone.  Motor abilities are delayed or never acquired, mostly depending upon the severity of the mutation. Most children with Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease learn to understand language, and usually have some speech. Other signs may include tremor, lack of coordination,  involuntary movements, weakness, unsteady gait, and over time, spasticity in legs and arms.  Muscle contractures often occur over time. Mental functions may deteriorate. Some patients may have convulsions and skeletal deformation, such as scoliosis, resulting from abnormal muscular stress on bones.[3]",
    "Cause": "Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease is caused by X-linked recessive mutations in the major myelin protein proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1). This causes hypomyelination in the central nervous system and severe neurological disease. The majority of mutations result in duplications of the entire PLP1 gene. Deletions of PLP1 locus (which are rare) cause a milder form of Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease than is observed with the typical duplication mutations, which demonstrates the critical importance of gene dosage at this locus for normal CNS function.[4]",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease is often first suggested after identification by magnetic resonance imaging of abnormal white matter (high T2 signal intensity, i.e. T2 lengthening) throughout the brain, which is typically evident by about 1 year of age, but more subtle abnormalities should be evident during infancy. Unless a family history consistent with sex-linked inheritance exists, the condition is often misdiagnosed as cerebral palsy. Once a PLP1 mutation is identified, prenatal diagnosis or preimplantation genetic diagnostic testing is possible.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "No cure for Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease has been developed.[9] Outcomes are variable: people with the most severe form of the disease do not usually survive to adolescence, although with milder forms, survival into adulthood is possible.[9]\nIonis Pharmaceuticals is currently testing ION356, an antisense oligonucleotide targeted against PLP1, in a Phase 1b trial in PMD patients.[10]",

In more localized and early disease, lesions are well demarcated and have seborrheic distribution (face, upper trunk, scalp). Small flaccid vesicles, unlike pemphigus vulgaris, are not found. The disease may develop slowly or may rapidly progress, resulting in an exfoliative erythroderma. UV radiation exacerbates pemphigus foliaceus. Patients experience burning and pain. The colloquial term for Brazilian endemic pemphigus, fogo selvagem (Portuguese for “wild fire”) and for the rare Hungarian variant, Csíp mint az erős Pista (Hungarian for \"strong burning by Pista\"), takes into account many of the clinical aspects of this disease: the burning feeling of the skin, the exacerbation of disease by the sun, and the crusted lesions that make the patients appear as if they had been burned.[5][6]",
    "Cause": "The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases describes the disease thus:",
    "Diagnosis": "Pemphigus foliaceus is diagnosed base on history, biopsy of the affected skin, and testing either a blood sample or a skin sample for the antibodies that cause pemphigus.[citation needed]\nThe differential diagnosis includes other forms of pemphigus, bullous impetigo, subcorneal pustular dermatosis, subacute cutaneous LE, and seborrheic dermatitis. As discussed earlier, the demonstration of IgG autoantibodies against epidermal cell surfaces is essential for separating these disorders from the pemphigus family. A complete review of medications should be done to exclude the possibility of drug-induced pemphigus foliaceus. Because the lesions of pemphigus foliaceus may become secondarily infected, the finding of bacteria does not confirm a diagnosis of bullous impetigo. Likewise, a clinical flare or recalcitrant disease may represent a superimposed disorder, e.g. tinea corporis, especially in patients on systemic corticosteroids.[6]",
    "Treatment": "Patients with this type of pemphigus do not necessarily require treatment with systemic therapy; the use of topical corticosteroids may suffice.[5] When the disease is active and widespread, however, the therapy for pemphigus foliaceus is, in general, similar to that for pemphigus vulgaris. In general, immunosuppressive agents, such as azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil and cyclophosphamide, when combined with corticosteroids, may result in gaining early control of the disease and an increased percentage of clinical remissions.[6]",

Other mucosal surfaces, the conjunctiva, nose, esophagus, penis, vulva, vagina, cervix, and anus, may also be affected. Flaccid blisters over the skin are frequently seen with sparing of the skin covering the palms and soles.[5]\nBlisters commonly erode and leave ulcerated lesions and erosions. A positive Nikolsky sign (induction of blistering in normal skin or at the edge of a blister) is indicative of the disease.[5]\nSevere pain with chewing can lead to weight loss and malnutrition.[5]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "Because it is a rare disease, diagnosis is often complicated and takes a long time.  Early in the disease patients may have erosions in the mouth or blisters on the skin.  These blisters can be itchy or painful.  Theoretically, the blisters should demonstrate a positive Nikolsky's sign, in which the skin sloughs off from slight rubbing, but this is not always reliable. The gold standard for diagnosis is a punch biopsy from the area around the lesion that is examined by direct immunofluorescent staining, in which cells are acantholytic, that is, lacking the normal intercellular connections that hold them together. These can also be seen on a Tzanck smear. These cells are basically rounded, nucleated keratinocytes formed due to antibody-mediated damage to cell adhesion protein desmoglein.\nPemphigus vulgaris is easily confused with impetigo and candidiasis.  IgG4 is considered pathogenic.  The diagnosis can be confirmed by testing for the infections that cause these other conditions, and by a lack of response to antibiotic treatment.[7]",
    "Treatment": "Corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive medications have historically been employed to reduce pemphigus symptoms, yet steroids are associated with serious and long-lasting side effects and their use should be limited as much as possible. Intravenous immunoglobulin, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, azathioprine, and cyclophosphamide have also been used with varying degrees of success.\nAn established alternative to steroids is monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab, which are increasingly being used as first-line treatment.  In the summer of 2018, the FDA granted full approval to rituximab for this application, following a successful fast-track evaluation.[8] In numerous case series, many patients achieve remission after one cycle of rituximab. Treatment is more successful if initiated early on in the course of disease, perhaps even at diagnosis. Rituximab treatment combined with monthly IV immunoglobulin infusions has resulted in long-term remission with no recurrence of disease in 10 years after treatment was halted.[9] This was a small trial study of 11 patients with 10 patients followed to completion.\nDue to the successful use of rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal treatment, in managing this disease, other anti-CD20 drugs such as ocrelizumab,[10] veltuzumab,[11] and ofatumumab[12] have been explored as potential treatments.\nKey companies in Pemphigus Vulgaris therapeutics include Principia Biopharma, Topas Therapeutics and Argenx BVBA.[citation needed] Rituximab demonstrated superior efficacy compared to mycophenolate mofetil in a Phase III clinical trial, results of which were published in 2021.[13]",

    "Disease": "Periodic paralysis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "N/A",
    "Cause": "One of the most common descriptions of periodic paralysis are episodic attacks of muscle weakness, which are commonly associated with serum potassium levels. Physical activity and diet content (carbohydrates) have been identified as PP triggers. Unlike non-dystrophic myotonias, the periodic paralysis phenotype is triggered after resting following exercise. Voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav1.4) mutations are among the key causes behind periodic paralysis.[3]\nHyper-kalemic PP (hyperPP) is identified with high extracellular potassium levels which are typically greater than 5 mM during attacks; however, HyperPP attacks can also take place without rise in potassium concentrations. HyperPP has a prevalence rate of 1/100,000. Patients become symptomatic around the age of 10. The weakness attacks in hyperPP are relatively short lasting, and range from minutes to hours. The attacks can happen upwards of ten times per month.[citation needed]\nHypo-kalemic PP (hypoPP) is associated with low potassium levels. The onset of hypoPP occurs between the ages of 15 and 35. The prevalence of hypoPP is estimated to 1/100,000. HypoPP can be triggered by many external factors such as stress, high-sugar diet, and rest after exercise. During hypoPP attacks, the serum potassium concentrations can drop to less than 3 mM. Furthermore, hypoPP attacks are considerably longer lasting than hyperPP. As exercise is a trigger for periodic paralysis attacks, recently there is more research going into the physiological changes that accompany exercise including changes in blood pH. [3]",
    "Diagnosis": "This disease is unusually difficult to diagnose. Patients often report years of wrong diagnosis and treatments that made them worse instead of better. Part of this may be that migraines are present in up to 50% of patients and can cause a confusing array of symptoms including headaches, speech difficulties and visual, auditory or sensory auras. DNA testing is available for only a half dozen common gene mutations, while dozens of known mutations are possible but are not routinely tested. Electromyography (EMG) findings are not specific but the McManis Protocol, also called the Compound Muscle Amplitude Potential test (CMAP) can be used by a skilled neurologist capable of utilizing the EMG, which can give assistance in diagnosing several of these PP disorders. The old glucose/insulin provocative testing can cause life-threatening symptoms and should not be used.[citation needed]\nAlso of note is that potassium levels do not have to range outside of normal limits to cause serious, even life-threatening paralysis. These diseases are not the same as having a very low level of potassium (hypokalemia) or high potassium (hyperkalemia) and must not be treated as such. The total body store of potassium is usually normal; it is just in the wrong place.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment of the periodic paralyses may include carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (such as acetazolamide, methazolamide or dichlorphenamide), taking supplemental oral potassium chloride and a potassium-sparing diuretic (for hypos) or avoiding potassium (for hypers), thiazide diuretics to increase the amount of potassium excreted by the kidneys (for hypers), and significant lifestyle changes including tightly controlled levels of exercise or activity.  However, treatment should be tailored to the particular type of periodic paralysis.[4][5][6]\nTreatment of periodic paralysis in Andersen-Tawil syndrome is similar to that for other types. However, pacemaker insertion or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator may be required to control cardiac symptoms.[7]",

Genetic disorders and teratogens (viruses, metabolic imbalance, and industrial or pharmacological agents) have been associated as possible causes.  Up to 50% (varies in studies) of cases are associated with chromosome 22q11 deletions (DiGeorge Syndrome). The neural crest, specifically a population known as the cardiac neural crest, directly contributes to the aorticopulmonary septum.[4][5]\nMicroablation of the cardiac neural crest in developing chick embryos and genetic anomalies affecting this population of cells in rodents results in persistent truncus arteriosus.[6][7][8]\nNumerous perturbations affecting the cardiac neural crest have been associated with persistent truncus arteriosus, some of which include growth factors (fibroblast growth factor 8 and bone morphogenetic protein), transcription factors (T-box, Pax, Nkx2-5, GATA-6, and Forkhead), and gap junction proteins (Connexin). The cardiac neural crest also contributes the smooth muscle of the great arteries.[citation needed]",

    "Treatment": "Treatment is with neonatal surgical repair, with the objective of restoring a normal pattern of blood flow.[13] The surgery is open heart, and the patient will be placed on cardiopulmonary bypass to allow the surgeon to work on a still heart. The heart is opened and the ventricular septal defect is closed with a patch. The pulmonary arteries are then detached from the common artery (truncus arteriosus) and connected to the right ventricle using a tube (a conduit or tunnel). The common artery, now separated from the pulmonary circulation, functions as the aorta with the truncal valve operating as the aortic valve. Most babies survive this surgical repair, but may require further surgery as they grow up. For example, the conduit does not grow with the child and may need to be replaced as the child grows.  Furthermore, the truncal valve is often abnormal and may require future surgery to improve its function.\nThere have been cases where the condition has been diagnosed at birth and surgical intervention is an option. A number of these cases have survived well into adulthood.[14]",

    "Disease": "Phenylketonuria",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Untreated PKU can lead to intellectual disability, seizures, behavioral problems, and mental disorders. It may also result in a musty smell and lighter skin. A baby born to a mother who has poorly treated PKU may have heart problems, a small head, and low birth weight.[1]\nBecause the mother's body is able to break down phenylalanine during pregnancy, infants with PKU are normal at birth. The disease is not detectable by physical examination at that time, because no damage has yet been done. Newborn screening is performed to detect the disease and initiate treatment before any damage is done. The blood sample is usually taken by a heel prick, typically performed 2–7 days after birth. This test can reveal elevated phenylalanine levels after one or two days of normal infant feeding.[11][12]\nIf a child is not diagnosed during the routine newborn screening test and a phenylalanine-restricted diet is not introduced, then phenylalanine levels in the blood will increase over time. Toxic levels of phenylalanine, along with insufficient levels of tyrosine, can interfere with infant development in ways that have permanent effects. The disease may present clinically with seizures, hypopigmentation (excessively fair hair and skin), and a \"musty odor\" to the baby's sweat and urine (due to phenylacetate, a carboxylic acid produced by the oxidation of phenylacetone). In most cases, a repeat test should be done around two weeks of age to verify the initial test and uncover any phenylketonuria that was initially missed.[13]\nUntreated children often fail to attain early developmental milestones, develop microcephaly, and demonstrate progressive impairment of cerebral function. Hyperactivity, EEG abnormalities, seizures, and severe learning disabilities are major clinical problems later in life. A characteristic \"musty or mousy\" odor on the skin, as well as a predisposition for eczema, persists throughout life in the absence of treatment.[14]\nThe damage done to the brain if PKU is untreated during the first months of life is not reversible. Affected children who are detected at birth and treated are much less likely to develop neurological problems or have seizures and intellectual disability, though such clinical disorders are still possible including asthma, eczema, anemia, weight gain, renal insufficiency, osteoporosis, gastritis, esophagus, and kidney deficiencies, kidney stones, and hypertension. Additionally, mood disorders occur 230% higher than controls; dizziness and giddiness occur 180% higher; chronic ischemic heart disease, asthma, diabetes, and gastroenteritis occur 170% higher; and stress and adjustment disorder occur 160% higher.[15][16] In general, however, outcomes for people treated for PKU are good.

If a person shows 9 cardinal features, they are classified as having PTHS.[14]\nIt is possible that a phenotype resembling PTHS can occur without the mutation in the TCF4 gene. Mutations in the TCF4 gene do not always result in stereotypical Pitt-Hopkins syndrome.[14]\nHalf of the individuals with PTHS are reported to have seizures, starting from childhood to the late teens.[9]\nAround 50% of those affected show abnormalities on brain imaging.

The disease may also infiltrate the dermis or, very rarely, the flexor tendon sheath.[9]",

MRI tends to be more accurate than x-ray or ultrasound, showing the full extent of the condition.[11]",
    "Treatment": "Although the origin of the disease is unknown, there is speculation that it is an aggressive healing response to small tears in the plantar fascia, almost as if the fascia over-repairs itself following an injury.  There is also some evidence that it might be genetic.[5]\nIn the early stages, when the nodule is single and/or smaller, it is recommended to avoid direct pressure to the nodule(s). Soft inner soles on footwear and padding may be helpful.[5]\nMRI and sonogram (diagnostic ultrasound) are effective in showing the extent of the lesion, but cannot reveal the tissue composition. Even then, recognition of the imaging characteristics of plantar fibromatoses can help in the clinical diagnosis.[2]\nSurgery of Ledderhose's disease is difficult because tendons, nerves, and muscles are located very closely to each other. Additionally, feet have to carry heavy load, and surgery might have unpleasant side effects. If surgery is performed, the biopsy is predominantly cellular and frequently misdiagnosed as fibrosarcoma.[6] Since the diseased area (lesion) is not encapsulated, clinical margins are difficult to define. As such, portions of the diseased tissue may be left in the foot after surgery. Inadequate excision is the leading cause of recurrence.[2][8]\nRadiotherapy has been shown to reduce the size of the nodules and reduce the pain associated with them. It is approximately 80% effective, with minimal side effects.[12]\nPost-surgical radiation treatment may decrease recurrence.[8] There has also been variable success in preventing recurrence by administering gadolinium.[8] Skin grafts have been shown to control the recurrence of the disease.[10]\nExtracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has, in some cases, been reported to significantly reduce pain and improve walking ability in patients with plantar fibromatosis.[13] Collagenase injection, FDA-approved for Dupuytren's contracture with favorable outcomes,[14] showed no benefit in a reported case of plantar fibromatosis.[15] Cryotherapy has also been reported as an effective treatment for Ledderhose disease, with an approximate 80% success rate and potentially lower recurrence than conventional surgery.[16]\nCortisone injections, such as triamcinolone,[4] and clobetasol ointments[10] have been shown to stall the progression of the disease temporarily, although the results are subjective and large-scale studies far from complete. Injections of superoxide dismutase have proven to be unsuccessful in curing the disease [10] while radiotherapy has been used successfully on early-stage Ledderhose nodules.[17][18][19][20]\nTopical verapamil is also used to treat plantar fibromatosis.[21][22]",

    "Signs and symptoms": "PCT is typically characterised by fragile skin and sore blisters in areas of skin that receive higher levels of exposure to sunlight, such as the face and backs of the hands.[1] These blisters burst easily resulting in erosions, crusts, and superficial ulcers.[1][2] There is often associated darkened skin color and extra facial hair growth.[1] Healing is typically slow, leading to scarring and milia, while changes such as hair loss, and alterations in nails may also occur.[1] A slightly purplish tint may be seen around the eyes.[1] Scleroderma-like thick skin may develop over fingers, scalp, behind the ears, at the back of the neck, or in the front of the chest.[1][2] The urine may appear dark with a hint of reddishness.[2]\nIn addition to the skin lesions, chronic liver disease is very common in patients with sporadic PCT.  This involves hepatic fibrosis (scarring of the liver), and inflammation. However, liver problems are less common in patients with the inherited form of the disease.[5] Additionally, patients will often void a wine-red color urine with an increased concentration of uroporphyrin I due to their enzymatic deficiency.[6]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "While the most common symptom of PCT is the appearance of skin lesions and blistering, their appearance is not conclusive. Laboratory testing commonly reveals high levels of uroporphyrinogen in the urine, clinically referred to as uroporphyrinogenuria.  Additionally, testing for common risk factors such as hepatitis C and hemochromatosis is strongly suggested, as their high prevalence in patients with PCT may require additional treatment.  If the clinical appearance of PCT is present, but the laboratories are negative, the diagnosis of pseudoporphyria should be seriously considered.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Since PCT is a chronic condition, comprehensive management of the disease is the most effective form of treatment. Primarily, it is key that patients diagnosed with PCT avoid alcohol consumption, iron supplements, excess exposure to sunlight (especially in the summer), as well as estrogen and chlorinated cyclic hydrocarbons, all of which can potentially exacerbate the disorder.  Additionally, the management of excess iron (due to the commonality of hemochromatosis in PCT patients) can be achieved through phlebotomy, whereby blood is systematically drained from the patient. A borderline iron deficiency has been found to have a protective effect by limiting heme synthesis.  In the absence of iron, which is to be incorporated in the porphyrin formed in the last step of the synthesis, the mRNA of erythroid 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS-2) is blocked by attachment of an iron-responsive element (IRE) binding cytosolic protein, and transcription of this key enzyme is inhibited.[28]\nLow doses of antimalarials can be used.[29] Orally ingested chloroquine is completely absorbed in the gut and is preferentially concentrated in the liver, spleen, and kidneys.[30] They work by removing excess porphyrins from the liver via increasing the excretion rate by forming a coordination complex with the iron center of the porphyrin as well as an intramolecular hydrogen bond between a propionate side chain of the porphyrin and the protonated quinuclidine nitrogen atom of either alkaloid.[31] Due to the presence of the chlorine atom, the entire complex is more water-soluble allowing the kidneys to preferentially remove it from the blood stream and expel it through urination.[30][32][33] Chloroquine treatment can induce porphyria attacks within the first couple of months of treatment due to the mass mobilization of porphyrins from the liver into the bloodstream.[30] Complete remission can be seen within 6–12 months as each dose of antimalarial can only remove a finite amount of porphyrins, and there are generally decades of accumulation to be cleared. Originally, higher doses were used to treat the condition, but are no longer recommended because of liver toxicity.[34][35] Finally, due to the strong association between PCT and Hepatitis C, the treatment of Hepatitis C (if present) is vital to the effective treatment of PCT.\nChloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and venesection are typically employed in the management strategy.[36]",

    "Disease": "Pre-eclampsia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Edema (especially in the hands and face) was originally considered an important sign for a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia. However, because edema is a common occurrence in pregnancy, its utility as a distinguishing factor in pre-eclampsia is not high. Pitting edema (unusual swelling, particularly of the hands, feet, or face, notable by leaving an indentation when pressed on) can be significant, and should be reported to a healthcare provider.\nFurther, a symptom such as epigastric pain may be misinterpreted as heartburn. Standard features of pre-eclampsia, which are screened for during prenatal visits, include elevated blood pressure and excess protein in the urine. Additionally, some women may develop severe headaches as a sign of pre-eclampsia.[38] In general, none of the signs of pre-eclampsia are specific, and even convulsions in pregnancy are more likely to have causes other than eclampsia in modern practice.[39] Diagnosis depends on finding a coincidence of several pre-eclamptic features, the final proof being their regression within the days and weeks after delivery.[22]",
    "Cause": "The cause of preeclampsia is not fully understood. It is likely related to factors such as:[2][40]\n• Abnormal placentation (formation and development of the placenta)\n• Immunologic factors\n• Prior or existing maternal pathology – pre-eclampsia is seen more at a higher incidence in individuals with pre-existing hypertension, obesity, or antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, or those with a history of pre-eclampsia\n• Dietary factors, e.g., calcium supplementation in areas where dietary calcium intake is low, have been shown to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia[6]\n• Environmental factors, e.g. air pollution[41]\n• Infection (for which there is much evidence),[42] including at the time of conception.[43]\nThose with long-term high blood pressure have a 7 to 8 times higher risk than those without.[44]\nPhysiologically, research has linked pre-eclampsia to the following physiologic changes: alterations in the interaction between the maternal immune response and the placenta, placental injury, endothelial cell injury, altered vascular reactivity, oxidative stress, imbalance among vasoactive substances, decreased intravascular volume, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.[40][45]\nWhile the exact cause of pre-eclampsia remains unclear, there is strong evidence that a major cause predisposing a susceptible woman to pre-eclampsia is an abnormally implanted placenta.[2][40] This abnormally implanted placenta may result in poor uterine and placental perfusion, yielding a state of hypoxia and increased oxidative stress and the release of anti-angiogenic proteins along with inflammatory mediators into the maternal plasma.[40] A major consequence of this sequence of events is generalized endothelial dysfunction.[15] The abnormal implantation may stem from the maternal immune system's response to the placenta, specifically a lack of established immunological tolerance in pregnancy. Endothelial dysfunction results in hypertension and many of the other symptoms and complications associated with pre-eclampsia.[2] When pre-eclampsia develops in the last weeks of pregnancy or a multiple pregnancy, the causation may, in some cases, partly be due to a large placenta outgrowing the capacity of the uterus, eventually leading to the symptoms of pre-eclampsia.[46]\nAbnormal chromosome 19 microRNA cluster (C19MC) impairs extravillus trophoblast cell invasion to the spiral arteries, causing high resistance, low blood flow, and low nutrient supply to the fetus.[47][48][49]",
    "Diagnosis": "N/A",
    "Treatment": "The definitive treatment for pre-eclampsia is the delivery of the baby and placenta. The danger to the mother persists after delivery, and full recovery can take days or weeks.[22] The timing of delivery should balance the desire for optimal outcomes for the baby while reducing risks for the mother.[40] The severity of the disease and the maturity of the baby are primary considerations.[103] These considerations are situation-specific, and management will vary with situation, location, and institution. Treatment can range from expectant management to expedited delivery by induction of labor or caesarean section. In the case of preterm delivery, additional treatments, including corticosteroid injection to accelerate fetal pulmonary maturation and magnesium sulfate for prevention of cerebral palsy, should be considered. Important in management is the assessment of the mother's organ systems, management of severe hypertension, and prevention and treatment of eclamptic seizures.[40] Separate interventions directed at the baby may also be necessary. Bed rest is not useful and is thus not routinely recommended.[104]",

    "Disease": "Primary ciliary dyskinesia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Around 80% of people with primary ciliary dyskinesia experience respiratory problems beginning within a day of birth. Many have a collapsed lobe of the lung and blood oxygen low enough to require treatment with supplemental oxygen.[1] Within the first few months of life, most develop a chronic mucus-producing cough and runny nose.[1] The main consequence of impaired ciliary function is reduced or absent mucus clearance from the lungs, and susceptibility to chronic recurrent respiratory infections, including sinusitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, and otitis media.  Progressive damage to the respiratory system is common, including progressive bronchiectasis beginning in early childhood, and sinus disease (sometimes becoming severe in adults).  However, diagnosis is often missed early in life despite the characteristic signs and symptoms.[2] In males, immotility of sperm can lead to infertility, although conception remains possible through the use of in vitro fertilization, there also are reported cases where sperm were able to move.[8] Trials have also shown that there is a marked reduction in fertility in females with Kartagener's syndrome due to dysfunction of the oviductal cilia.[9]\nMany affected individuals experience hearing loss and show symptoms of otitis media which demonstrates variable responsiveness to the insertion of myringotomy tubes or grommets. Some patients have a poor sense of smell, which is believed to accompany high mucus production in the sinuses (although others report normal – or even acute – sensitivity to smell and taste). Clinical progression of the disease is variable, with lung transplantation required in severe cases. Susceptibility to infections can be drastically reduced by an early diagnosis. Treatment with various chest physiotherapy techniques has been observed to reduce the incidence of lung infection and to slow the progression of bronchiectasis dramatically. Aggressive treatment of sinus disease beginning at an early age is believed to slow long-term sinus damage (although this has not yet been adequately documented). Aggressive measures to enhance clearance of mucus, prevent respiratory infections, and treat bacterial superinfections have been observed to slow lung-disease progression. The predicted incidence is 1 in approximately 7500.[10]",

    "Disease": "Primary lateral sclerosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Onset of PLS usually occurs spontaneously after age 50 and progresses gradually over a number of years, or even decades. The disorder usually begins in the legs, but it may start in the tongue or the hands. Symptoms may include difficulty with balance, weakness and stiffness in the legs, and clumsiness. Other common symptoms are spasticity (involuntary muscle contraction due to the stretching of muscle, which depends on the velocity of the stretch) in the hands, feet, or legs, foot dragging, and speech and swallowing problems due to involvement of the facial muscles. Breathing may also become compromised in the later stages of the disease, causing those patients who develop ventilatory failure to require noninvasive ventilatory support.[2] Hyperreflexia is another key feature of PLS as seen in patients presenting with the Babinski's sign.[3]  Some people present with emotional lability and bladder urgency,[3] and occasionally people with PLS experience mild cognitive changes detectable on neuropsychological testing, particularly on measures of executive function.[4]\nPLS is not considered hereditary when onset is in adulthood; however, juvenile primary lateral sclerosis (JPLS) has been linked to a mutation in the ALS2 gene which encodes the cell-signalling protein alsin.[5]\nThe issue of whether PLS exists as a different entity from ALS is not clear, as some patients initially diagnosed as having PLS ultimately develop lower motor neuron signs.[6][7] When this happens it is classed as ALS.[8]",
    "Cause": "Researchers do not fully understand what causes PLS, although it is thought it could be due to a combination of environmental and genetic factors.[9] Studies are being done to evaluate the possible causes, although linking causality can be difficult due to the relatively low number of people who are diagnosed with PLS.[citation needed]\nJuvenile PLS may be caused by the ALS2 gene, although this condition is very rare.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "There are no specific tests for the diagnosis of PLS. Therefore, the diagnosis occurs as the result of eliminating other possible causes of the symptoms and by an extended observation period.[10]\nLike ALS, diagnosing PLS is a diagnosis of exclusion, as there is no one test that can confirm a diagnosis of PLS. The Pringle Criteria,[11] proposed by Pringle et al., provides a guideline of nine points that, if confirmed, can suggest a diagnosis of PLS. Due to the fact that a person with ALS may initially present with only upper motor neuron symptoms, indicative of PLS, one key aspect of the Pringle Criteria is requiring a minimum of three years between symptom onset and symptom diagnosis. When these criteria are met, a diagnosis of PLS is highly likely.[12] Other aspects of Pringle Criteria include normal EMG findings, thereby ruling out lower motor neuron involvement that is indicative of ALS, and absence of family history for Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) and ALS. Imaging studies to rule out structural or demyelinating lesions may be done as well. Hoffman's sign and Babinski reflex may be present and indicative of upper motor neuron damage.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment for individuals with PLS is symptomatic. Baclofen and tizanidine may reduce spasticity. Quinine or phenytoin may decrease cramps. Some patients who do not receive adequate relief from oral treatment may consider intrathecal baclofen (i.e., infusion of medication directly into the cerebrospinal fluid via a surgically placed continuous infusion pump). However, patients are carefully selected for this type of procedure to ensure that they will likely benefit from this invasive procedure.[2]\nPhysical therapy often helps prevent joint immobility. Speech therapy may be useful for those with involvement of the facial muscles. Physiotherapy treatment focuses on reducing muscle tone, maintaining or improving range of motion, increasing strength and coordination, and improving functional mobility. In PLS, stretching is thought to improve flexibility and can also reduce muscle spasticity and cramps.[3]\nPatients with PLS may find it beneficial to have an evaluation, as well as follow-up visits at multidisciplinary clinics, similar to those available for people with ALS. These multidisciplinary clinics may provide patients with the necessary treatment that they require by having an occupational therapist, physical therapist, speech language pathologist, dietician and nutritionist, all in one site.[2]",

    "Signs and symptoms": "Most children with progeria appear normal at birth and during early infancy.[11] Children with progeria usually develop the first symptoms during their first few months of life. The earliest symptoms may include a failure to thrive and a localized scleroderma-like skin condition. As a child ages past infancy, additional conditions become apparent, usually around 18–24 months. Limited growth, full-body alopecia (hair loss), and a distinctive appearance (a small face with a shallow, recessed jaw and a pinched nose) are all characteristics of progeria.[5]\nSigns and symptoms of this progressive disease tend to become more marked as the child ages. Later, the condition causes wrinkled skin, kidney failure, loss of eyesight, and atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular problems.[12] Scleroderma, a hardening and tightening of the skin on trunk and extremities of the body, is prevalent. People diagnosed with this disorder usually have small, fragile bodies, like those of older adults. The head is usually large relative to the body, with a narrow, wrinkled face and a beak nose. Prominent scalp veins are noticeable (made more obvious by alopecia), as well as prominent eyes. Musculoskeletal degeneration causes loss of body fat and muscle, stiff joints, hip dislocations, and other symptoms generally absent in the non-elderly population. Individuals usually retain typical mental and motor function.[citation needed]",

    "Treatment": "In November 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved lonafarnib, which helps prevent buildup of defective progerin and similar proteins.[48] A clinical trial in 2018 points to significantly lower mortality rates – treatment with lonafarnib alone compared with no treatment (3.7% vs. 33.3%) – at a median post-trial follow-up time span of 2.2 years.[49] The drug, given orphan drug status and Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher, is taken twice daily in the form of capsules and may cost US$650,000 per year, making it prohibitive for the vast majority of families. It is unclear how it will be covered by health insurance in the United States. Common side effects of the drug include \"nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, infections, decreased appetite, and fatigue\".[13]\nOther treatment options have focused on reducing complications (such as cardiovascular disease) with coronary artery bypass surgery and low-dose acetylsalicylic acid.[50] Growth hormone treatment has been attempted.[51] The use of Morpholinos has also been attempted in mice and cell cultures in order to reduce progerin production. Antisense Morpholino oligonucleotides specifically directed against the mutated exon 11–exon 12 junction in the mutated pre-mRNAs were used.[52]\nA type of anticancer drug, the farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs), has been proposed, but their use has been mostly limited to animal models.[53] A Phase II clinical trial using the FTI lonafarnib began in May 2007.[54] In studies on the cells another anti-cancer drug, rapamycin, caused removal of progerin from the nuclear membrane through autophagy.[20][55] It has been proved that pravastatin and zoledronate are effective drugs when it comes to the blocking of farnesyl group production.[citation needed]\nFarnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) are drugs that inhibit the activity of an enzyme needed to make a link between progerin proteins and farnesyl groups. This link generates the permanent attachment of the progerin to the nuclear rim. In progeria, cellular damage can occur because that attachment occurs, and the nucleus is not in a normal state. Lonafarnib is an FTI, which means it can avoid this link, so progerin can not remain attached to the nucleus rim, and it now has a more normal state.[citation needed]\nStudies of sirolimus, an mTOR Inhibitor, demonstrate that it can minimize the phenotypic effects of progeria fibroblasts. Other observed consequences of its use are abolishing nuclear blebbing, degradation of progerin in affected cells, and reducing insoluble progerin aggregates formation. These results have been observed only in vitro and are not the results of any clinical trial, although it is believed that the treatment might benefit HGPS patients.[20]\nRecently, it has been demonstrated that the CRM1 protein (a key component of the nuclear export machinery in mammalian) is upregulated in HGPS cells, which drives to the abnormal localization of NES containing proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.[56] Moreover, the inhibition of CRM1 in HGPS alleviates the associated-senescence phenotype[56] as well as the mitochondrial function (an important determinant in senescence) and lysosome content.[41] These results are under in vivo validation with selinexor (a more suitable CRM1 inhibitor for human use[57]).",

    "Treatment": "No drugs effectively inhibit or cure the virus infection without toxicity. Therefore, treatment aims at reversing the immune deficiency to slow or stop the disease progress. In patients on immunosuppression, this means stopping the drugs or using plasma exchange to accelerate the removal of the biologic agent that put the person at risk for PML.[1]\nIn HIV-infected people, this may mean starting highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). AIDS patients starting HAART after being diagnosed with PML tend to have a slightly longer survival time than patients who were already on HAART and then develop PML.[13] Some AIDS patients with PML have been able to survive for several years, with HAART.[14] A rare complication of effective HAART is immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), in which increased immune system activity actually increases the damage caused by the JCV infection; although IRIS can often be managed with medication, it is extremely dangerous in PML.[15]\nCidofovir was studied as possible treatment for PML[16] and has been used on a case-by-case basis, working in some, but not others.\nCytarabine (also known as ARA-C), a chemotherapy drug used to treat certain cancers, has been prescribed on an experimental basis for a small number of non-AIDS PML patients, and stabilized the neurological condition of a minority of these patients.[17]  One patient regained some cognitive function lost as a result of PML.[18]\nIn June 2010, the first case report appeared of a PML patient being successfully treated with the antimalarial drug mefloquine with activity against the JC virus.

    "Disease": "Progressive supranuclear palsy",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The initial symptoms in two-thirds of cases are loss of balance, lunging forward when mobilizing, fast walking, bumping into objects or people, and falls.[7][3][4] Dementia symptoms are also initially seen in about one in five cases.[8]\nOther common early symptoms are changes in personality, general slowing of movement, and visual symptoms. The most common behavioural  symptoms in patients with PSP include apathy, a lack of inhibition, anxiety, and a profound state of unease or dissatisfaction.[8]\nLater symptoms and signs can include, but do not necessarily include dementia (typically including loss of inhibition and ability to organize information), slurring of speech, difficulty swallowing, and difficulty moving the eyes, particularly in the vertical direction.  The latter accounts for some of the falls experienced by these patients, as they find it difficult to look up or down.[9]\nSome of the other signs are poor eyelid function, contracture of the facial muscles, a backward tilt of the head with stiffening of the neck muscles, sleep disruption, urinary incontinence, and constipation.[9]  Some patients retain full cognitive function up to the end.[10]\nThe visual symptoms are of particular importance in the diagnosis of this disorder.  Patients typically complain of difficulty reading due to the inability to look downwards. The ophthalmoparesis experienced by these patients mainly concerns voluntary eye movement and the inability to make vertical saccades, which is often worse with downward saccades.  Patients tend to have difficulty looking down (a downgaze palsy) followed by the addition of an upgaze palsy. This vertical gaze paresis will correct when the examiner passively rolls the patient's head up and down as part of a test for the oculocephalic reflex.  Involuntary eye movement, as elicited by Bell's phenomenon, for instance, may be closer to normal.[10]\nOn close inspection, eye movements called \"square-wave jerks\" may be visible when the patient fixes gaze at distance. These are fine movements, that can be mistaken for nystagmus, except that they are saccadic in nature, with no smooth phase. Although healthy individuals also make square-wave jerk movements, PSP patients make slower square-wave jerk movements, with smaller vertical components.[11] Assessment of these square-wave jerks and diminished vertical saccades is especially useful for diagnosing progressive supranuclear palsy, because these movements set PSP patients apart from other parkinsonian patients.[11] Difficulties with convergence (convergence insufficiency), where the eyes come closer together while focusing on something near, like the pages of a book, is typical.  Because the eyes have trouble coming together to focus at short distances, the patient may complain of diplopia (double vision) when reading.[9]\nA characteristic facial appearance known as procerus sign, with a wide-eye stare, furrowing of forehead with a frowning expression, and deepening of other facial creases, is also diagnostic of PSP.[12]",
    "Cause": "The cause of PSP is unknown. Fewer than 1% of those with PSP have a family member with the same disorder. A variant in the MAPT gene for tau protein called the H1 haplotype, located on chromosome 17 (rs1800547), has been linked to PSP.[19] Nearly all people with PSP received a copy of that variant from each parent, but this is true of about two-thirds of the general population. The H1 haplotype of the MAPT gene has been identified in approximately 94% of individuals with PSP, compared to around 78% in healthy adults.[20] Therefore, the H1 haplotype appears to be necessary but not sufficient to cause PSP.  Other genes, as well as environmental toxins, are being investigated as other possible contributors to the cause of PSP.[21]\nAdditionally, the H2 haplotype, combined with vascular dysfunction, seems to be a factor of vascular progressive supranuclear palsy.[22]",
    "Diagnosis": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often used to diagnose PSP. MRI may show atrophy in the midbrain with preservation of the pons giving a \"hummingbird\" sign.[3][40]",
    "Treatment": "Management is only supportive as a cure for PSP is unknown. PSP cases are often split into two subgroups, PSP-RS and PSP-P, where a short-term response to levodopa can be obtained.[10][56] Dyskinesia is an occasional but rare complication of treatment.[57] Other variants have been described.[58][59][60][61] Botox can be used to treat neck dystonia and blepharospasm, but this can aggravate dysphagia.[62]\nTwo studies have suggested that rivastigmine may help with cognitive aspects, but the authors of both studies have suggested that larger studies are needed.[63][64] There is some evidence from small-scale studies that the hypnotic zolpidem may improve motor function and eye movements.[65][66]\nCurrent clinical trials focus on disease modifying treatments but there are currently no FDA approved disease modifying treatments for PSP-RS.[39] Recent trials have focused on therapies targeting the 4R tau accumulation in the brain of those with PSP-RS. These therapies include microtubule-stabilizing agents, tau gain-of-function therapies, and monoclonal antibodies.[10][39] These therapies are currently being tested in clinical trials.[10][39]",

    "Disease": "Prolidase deficiency",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Prolidase deficiency generally becomes evident during infancy, but initial symptoms can first manifest anytime from birth to young adulthood. The condition results in a very diverse set symptoms,[3] the severity of which can vary significantly between patients, depending on the degree to which prolidase activity is hampered by the individual underlying mutation(s) in each case. It is even possible, though rare, for affected individuals to be asymptomatic, in which case the disorder can only be identified through laboratory screening of the prospective patient and/or their extended family.[citation needed]\nOne of the signature features of PD is the elimination of high quantities of peptides through urine.[citation needed]\nIn addition, most of those affected exhibit persistent skin lesions (starting from a mild rash) or ulcers, primarily on the legs and feet, the formation of which normally begins during childhood.[3] Clinically, these, among other dermatological issues, represent the most distinguishing and most frequent symptoms.[4] These may never recede, potentially leading to severe infections that can, in the worst case, necessitate amputation.[citation needed]\nPD patients exhibit a weak immune system and markedly elevated vulnerability to infections in general, and particularly those of the respiratory system, leading some who suffer from PD to acquire recurrent lung disease. They may also have an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly), and on some occasions the spleen and liver may both be enlarged (hepatosplenomegaly).[3] Photosensitivity and hyperkeratosis have been associated with PD. Abnormal facial characteristics, consisting of pronounced eyes which are spaced far apart (hypertelorism), a high forehead, a compressed bridge of the nose or saddle nose, and a small lower jaw and chin (micrognathia), are also observed in the majority of cases.[3]\nThose affected by PD can also suffer intellectual disabilities (approx. 75% of recorded cases do) ranging from mild to severe – mental development during childhood may therefore progress more slowly.[citation needed]",
    "Cause": "Prolidase deficiency is the result of mutations on the PEPD gene which is located on the \"q\", i.e., long, arm of chromosome 19 at region 1, band 3,sub-band 11 (notated as 19q13.11).[5] This gene codes for the prolidase Enzyme, also known as peptidase-D.[3] At least 19 different mutations in the PEPD gene have been identified in individuals affected by the disorder.[6]\nProlidase is involved in the degradation of certain iminodipeptides (those containing C-terminal proline or hydroxyproline) formed during the breakdown of collagen, recycling the constituent amino acids (proline and hydroxyproline) and making them available for the cell to reuse – not least in the synthesis of new collagen. This recycling by prolidase, seen in the image above, is essential for maintaining proline-based systems in the cell, such as the collagen-rich extracellular matrix (ECM), which serves to physically support the structure of internal organs and connective tissues. Inadequate recycling due to a dysfunctional prolidase enzyme, caused by an appropriate mutation in the pertinent gene, leads to the deterioration of that support structure and therefore the connective tissue of the skin, capillaries, and the lymphatic tissue, as is the case in PD.[citation needed]\nIn particular, it has been proposed that the buildup of non-degraded dipeptides might induce programmed cell-death (apoptosis), whereafter the cell's contents would be expelled into the neighbouring tissue potentially resulting in inflammation and giving rise to the dermatological problems seen in PD. Similarly, a dysfunctional collagen metabolism will likely interfere with physiological remodelling processes of the extracellular matrix (which require collagen to be dynamically degraded and rebuilt), which might cause problems with the skin, as well.  [citation needed]\nThe mental impairment observed in those with PD might reasonably arise from complications involving neuropeptides, proteins that have an abundance of proline and are involved with communication in the brain.[citation needed]\nThe condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, meaning that both copies of the gene contained in every cell (both alleles) are mutated. Each of the parents of the person who suffers from an autosomal recessive disorder possesses one copy of the mutant gene, but they usually do not exhibit the signs and symptoms of the disorder, as their other copy is functional and can compensate for any deleterious effects.[3]",
    "Diagnosis": "PD diagnosis is based primarily on the presence and position of ulcers on the skin, as well as identifying particular protein markers in urine. To confirm the diagnosis, a blood test is required to measure prolidase activity.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "No curative treatment is available for prolidase deficiency at this time, although palliative treatment is possible to some extent.[citation needed]\nThe latter mainly focuses on treating the skin lesions through standard methods and stalling collagen degradation (or boosting prolidase performance, where possible), so as to keep the intracellular dipeptide levels low and give the cells time to resynthesise or absorb what proline they cannot recycle so as to be able to rebuild what collagen does degrade. Patients can be treated orally with ascorbate (a.k.a. vitamin C, a cofactor of prolyl hydroxylase, an enzyme that hydroxylates proline, increasing collagen stability), manganese (a cofactor of prolidase), suppression of collagenase (a collagen degrading enzyme), and local applications of ointments that contain L-glycine and L-proline. The response to the treatment is inconsistent between affected individuals.[7]\nA therapeutic approach based on enzyme replacement (administering functional prolidase) is under consideration.[8]\nDue to the weakened immune response in PD cases, it is also of paramount importance to keep any infections under control, often with heavy antibiotics.[citation needed]",

    "Disease": "Properdin deficiency",
    "Signs and symptoms": "As a protein involved in the function of the immune system, no external changes in physiology or aberrant physical characteristics are expressed by individuals possessing a properdin deficiency. However, individuals that have a properdin deficiency do have a heightened susceptibility to bacterial infections, most notably caused by bacteria within the Neisseria genus, though there have also been studied cases of individuals with recurrent pneumococcus bacteremia as a result of Streptococcus pneumoniae, another species of bacteria from an entirely different phylum.[3][4] Due to a heightened susceptibility to Neisseria bacterium, individuals with properdin deficiency are far more likely to succumb to bacterial infection such as meningitis, resulting in inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, which causes severe headaches, fevers, and neck stiffness, and may result in further development of other meningococcal diseases and extreme complications such as sepsis.[5] Individuals with properdin deficiency are also more likely to catch the sexually transmitted disease, gonorrhea, as it is also caused by Neisseria bacterium, resulting in swelling, itching, pain, and formation of pus on the mucous membranes, including, but not limited to, the genitals, mouth, and rectum.[6]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "As mentioned before, there are no external indications of properdin deficiency, and as such, properdin deficiency can only be reliably detected by lab tests.[3] The typical tests for complement deficiencies, such as the measurement of C3 and C4, do not detect low levels of the absence of properdin.[2] These pathways are typically unaltered by any of the three types of properdin deficiencies, but even when they are affected, it is typically within normal levels and is not cause for concern.[2] Instead, histories of infection with anything from the Neisseria genus as well as family history can be indicators, but only specialist centers can screen for properdin deficiencies using immunochemical assays.[2] In particular, the use of ELISA proves to be one of the most effective methods of detecting properdin deficiency, as the average healthy male is expected to show properdin antigen levels of around 128.0 ELISA units/ml, and obligate carrier females (recall that properdin deficiency is an X-linked disease) tend to show an average of 45.6 units/ml.[3] An individual with properdin deficiency should, by definition, show very little to no properdin antigen levels at all, as they do not possess the requisite gene to produce the protein. While properdin deficiencies are rare, they have only been diagnosed in Caucasians, but no other race/ethnicity.[2]",
    "Treatment": "N/A",
    "Management": "Pertaining to complement deficiencies, there is no cure and the treatments for complement deficiencies vary widely. The best course of action for management is usually for a patient to treat the complement deficiency as an immune deficiency and get immunized against the microbe associated with their deficiency (or best candidate).[7] As mentioned earlier, individuals with properdin deficiency are increasingly susceptible to Neisseria bacterium. Recent studies have indicated that individuals with properdin deficiency respond well when they are immunized with tetravalent polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine, which generates anti capsular antibodies and bactericidal anti-meningococcal activity against serotypes covered by the given vaccine.[2] The vaccine has been reported to lower the chances of reinfection by meningococci in individuals who have undergone the treatment, however the vaccine does not protect against group B meningococci and chemotherapy is recommended if full protection from all meningococci variants is desired.[2]"

These include low serum potassium (hypokalemia), elevated serum sodium (hypernatremia), and elevated serum bicarbonate (metabolic alkalosis).[1] Urine studies may show elevated urine potassium (kaliuresis). To further differentiate between hyperaldosteronism and pseudohyperaldosteronism, studies including plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) can be obtained.[1][2] Pseudohyperaldosteronism will exhibit low levels of both PRA and PAC while hyperaldosteronism will demonstrate elevated PAC.[1] Confirmatory tests to diagnose the specific forms of pseudohyperaldosteronism vary depending on the cause. The genetic conditions such as Liddle's syndrome and CAH can be confirmed with genetic tests for the affected genes.[1][4] CAH can also be confirmed by analyzing enzyme levels following ACTH stimulation testing.[1] AME can be diagnosed with a 24 hour urine collection exhibiting an increased ratio of urinary cortisol to urinary cortisone.[1]",
    "Treatment": "Specific treatment of pseudohyperaldosteronism depends on the inciting cause. General management focuses on countering the effects of excess mineralocorticoid activity to achieve adequate blood pressure control and avoid end-organ damage and cardiovascular mortality.[1] In some cases, specific antihypertensive medications may be recommended. In Liddle's syndrome, ENaC-binding potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. amiloride or triamterene) are used to counter the excess ENaC activity.[4][10][2] In AME, the mineralocorticoid receptor-binding potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. spironolactone or eplerenone) are used to limit aldosterone receptor activity.[1] Other medications such as glucocorticoids are added in AME and CAH to inhibit ACTH and further cortisol production.[1] Lifestyle changes such as a low sodium diet are also used for managing hypertension,[1][2] and cessation of licorice intake is recommended in cases of licorice overconsumption.[1][3]",

Diagnostic tests may include CT scans, examination of tissue samples obtained through laparoscopy, and the evaluation of tumor markers.\nIn most cases, a colonoscopy is unsuitable as a diagnostic tool, because, in most cases, appendix cancer invades the abdominal cavity but not the colon (however, spread inside the colon is occasionally reported). PET scans may be used to evaluate high-grade mucinous adenocarcinoma, but this test is not reliable for detecting low-grade tumors, because those do not take up the dye which shows up on scans.

    "Disease": "Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The signs and symptoms of PAP include shortness of breath,[1] cough, low grade fever, and weight loss. Additionally, the clinical course of PAP is unpredictable. Spontaneous remission is recognized, and some patients have stable symptoms. Notably, some individuals with PAP may remain asymptomatic, with the condition only being detected incidentally during medical evaluations.[2] Death may occur due to the progression of PAP or of any underlying associated disease. Individuals with PAP are more vulnerable to lung infections such as nocardiosis, Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infection, or fungal infections.[1]",
    "Cause": "The abnormal accumulation of lipoproteinaceous compounds in PAP is due to impaired surfactant regulation and clearance. This is usually related to impaired alveolar macrophage function.[3] In adults, the most common cause of PAP is an autoimmunity to granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), a critical factor in development of alveolar macrophages. Decreased bioavailability of GM-CSF results in poor alveolar macrophages development and function, which results in accumulation of surfactant and related products.[3]\nSecondary causes of PAP are those in which the accumulation of lipoproteinaceous compounds is secondary to another disease process. This has been recognized in the settings of certain cancers (such as myeloid leukemia), lung infections, or environmental exposure to dusts or chemicals, such as nickel.[4]\nAlthough the cause of PAP was not originally understood, a major breakthrough in the understanding of the cause of the disease came by the chance observation that mice bred for experimental study to lack a hematologic growth factor known as granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) developed a pulmonary syndrome of abnormal surfactant accumulation resembling human PAP.[5]\nThe implications of this finding are still being explored, but significant progress was reported in February 2007.  Researchers in that report discussed the presence of anti-GM-CSF autoantibodies in patients with PAP, and duplicated that syndrome with the infusion of these autoantibodies into mice.[6]\nFamilial or sporadic inactivating mutations in one of the two parental GATA2 genes produces an autosomal dominant disorder termed GATA2 deficiency.  The GATA2 gene produces the GATA2 transcription factor which is critical for the embryonic development, maintenance, and functionality of blood-forming, lympathic-forming, and other tissue-forming cells. Individuals with a single GATA2 inactivating mutation present with a wide range of disorders including pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. GATA2 mutation-based pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is associated with normal levels of GM-CSF and commonly improves or is avoided in afflicted individuals who successfully receive a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.[7][8]",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of PAP is made using a combination of a person's symptoms, chest imaging, and microscopic evaluation of lung washing/tissue. Additional testing for serum anti-GM-CSF antibodies are helpful for confirmation.[11]\nAlthough both the symptoms and imaging findings are stereotypical and well-described, they are non-specific and indistinguishable from many other conditions. For example, chest x-ray may show alveolar opacities, and a CT may show a crazy paving lung pattern, both of which are seen more commonly in numerous other conditions.[12]  Thus, the diagnosis primarily depends on the pathology findings.[citation needed]\nLung washings or tissue for histopathologic analysis are most commonly obtained using bronchoalveolar lavage and/or lung biopsy.[13] Characteristic biopsy findings show filling of the alveoli (and sometimes terminal bronchioles) with an amorphous eosinophilic material, which stains strongly positive on PAS stain and the PAS diastase stain. The surrounding alveoli and pulmonary interstitium remain relatively normal.[14] Electron microscopy of the sample, although not typically performed due to impracticality, shows lamellated bodies representing surfactant.[15]  An alternative diagnosis with similar histomorphologic findings is Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.[15]\nLung washings characteristically yield a fluid which is \"milky\"composition. Under the microscope, samples show 20-50 micrometer PAS-positive globules on a background of finely granular or amorphous PAS-positive material. There is typically a low numbers of macrophages and inflammatory cells (although this is variable).[14][15]",
    "Treatment": "The standard treatment for PAP is whole-lung lavage[16][17][18] and supportive care.[19][20][21] This procedure is performed under general anesthesia, in which one lung is pumped with oxygen (ventilated lung), and the other lung (non-ventilated lung) is filled repeatedly with a warm saline solution and drained, removing any proteinaceous effluent along with it.[22] This process may be repeated up to 40 times depending on the severity of the patient's condition; a 2016 survey of 20 centers found that the mean lavage volume was 15.4 liters.[23] Whole-lung lavage is generally effective at improving PAP symptoms, often for a prolonged period of time.[24]\nOther treatments still being studied include subcutaneous and inhaled GM-CSF, and rituximab, an intravenous infusion that works to stop the production of the autoantibodies responsible for autoimmune PAP.[19][20][21][25] Lung transplantation has been performed in individuals with the various forms of PAP; however, this is often only used when all other treatment options have failed and significant lung damage has developed due to the risks, complications, or recurrence of PAP following transplantation.[21][25][26] As of 2022, methionine oral supplementation has been tested on patients with methionine tRNA synthetase-related PAP and has strong evidence of its efficacy on these patients.[27]",

    "Signs and symptoms": "Dyspnea (breathlessness) is the most common symptom associated with PAH and also usually the first symptom, with 98% of people experiencing dyspnea at the time of diagnosis.[2] Fatigue, lightheadedness, palpitations, chest pain are also present.[1][2] Late findings include near-syncope or syncope (fainting). As PAH progresses and chronically elevated pulmonary arterial pressures result in right heart failure; swelling of the legs and other areas of the body (edema), fluid buildup in the abdomen (ascites) develop as late symptoms.[2]\nFindings on physical exam indicating right heart failure may be present, including a loud P2 heart sound (the sound from the pulmonic valve closing), a heart murmur indicating tricuspid regurgitation or an elevated jugular venous pressure.[2][1]\nThe WHO introduced a functional classification in PAH which is used to estimate disease severity as well as response to treatment. WHO class 1 is characterized by no limitations with usual physical activity. Class 2 involves discomfort with physical activity and mild limitations. Class 3 disease involves a marked limitation with physical activity and symptoms being present with light activities. Class 4 disease involves severe symptoms with almost any physical activity and symptoms being present at rest.[4]",
    "Cause": "The cause of PAH is unknown. Idiopathic PAH (WHO group 1.1) is not associated with an underlying disease or exposure.[2] It is estimated that 39-46% of those with PAH have the idiopathic variant.[2]\nGroup 1.2 PAH includes the variants that are heritable. Genetic variants or mutations in bone morphogenic protein receptor 2 (BMPR2) account for approximately 75-80% of cases of heritable PAH.[1][2] BMPR2 mutations are also seen in 20% of idiopathic PAH.[1] BMPR2 is a protein involved in endothelial cell (cells that line blood vessels) proliferation and remodeling. Other types of genes coding for proteins involved in BMPR2 signaling have also been implicated as causes of heritable PAH, such as activin A receptor type-2-like-1 ACVRL1, Endoglin (ENG), SMAD genes encoding for SMAD transcription factors involved in downstream BMPR2 signaling and cell growth including Smad1, Smad4 and Smad9.[1] KCNK3 encodes for a potassium channel which regulates membrane potential across cells thus controlling vascular tone. Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 4 (E1F2AK4) is mutated causes heritable pulmonary veno-occlusive disease and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis.[7]\nGroup 1.3 PAH includes disease that is due to drug or toxin exposures. Methamphetamines, the chemotherapeutic dasatinib and the appetite suppressant and diet drug fenfluramine are associated with PAH.[2]\nGroup 1.4 PAH is disease that is associated with underlying disease. Group 1.4.1 is associated with connective tissue disorders including scleroderma (with scleroderma being the most common disorder with an estimated 8-19% of scleroderma patients having PAH), lupus, mixed connective tissue disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjogren's syndrome.[2] Group 1.4.2 is associated with HIV, group 1.4.3 associated with portal hypertension (commonly due to liver cirrhosis), group 1.4.4 associated with congenital heart disease, and 1.4.5 associated with schistosomiasis. In areas where schistosomiasis is prevalent, PAH due to schistosomiasis is believed to be the most prevalent variant of PAH. It is estimated that 5-8% of people with schistosomiasis with liver fibrosis have PAH.[2]\nGroup 1.5 PAH is the variant of PAH that is responsive to vasodilators (calcium channel blockers). The response to vasodilation by definition includes a decrease in the pulmonary arterial pressure of 10 mmHg or more to less than 40 mmHg without a decline in the cardiac output upon infusion of nitrous oxide(vasodilator) during the right heart catheterization. Vasodilator responsive PAH is estimated to be 6.8% of PAH patients in one study, and it is associated with a more favorable prognosis.[2]\nGroup 1.6 PAH includes PAH with features of venous or capillary involvement and is thought to comprise 5-10% of PAH cases. Two conditions, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis comprise this category. The subcategory is characterized by severe hypoxemia, capillary congestion and prominent post-capillary venule thickening.[2]\nGroup 1.7 PAH, with an estimated 0.18% prevalence, is persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. This results when the circulation does not transition from fetal to newborn configuration, leaving a patent ductus arteriosus and patent foramen ovale with left to right shunting exposing the pulmonary circulation to high pressures. PAH due to persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn has a 7.6% mortality at 1 year.[2]\nPeople may sometimes have PAH belonging to more than one sub-category.[1]",
    "Diagnosis": "Echocardiography is the preferred screening test in the diagnosis of PAH as it accurately estimates pulmonary pressures.[1] Other causes of pulmonary hypertension, such as left heart disease (WHO group 2), pulmonary hypertension due to lung disease (such as COPD)(WHO group 3) and pulmonary hypertension due to chronic blood clots in the pulmonary arteries (WHO group 4) need to be ruled out.[1] Some tests which are commonly used include a CT scan of the chest, ventilation perfusion scan or a CT angiography (to rule out pulmonary hypertension due to chronic blood clots), pulmonary function test, and a cardiac MRI. Cardiac MRI is the preferred test to evaluate right ventricular structure and function in PAH. Pulmonary function testing in PAH may show an obstructive or restrictive defect, and the diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (used as a surrogate for gas exchange in the alveoli) is reduced.[1]\nA sleep study helps to rule out sleep disordered breathing, such as sleep apnea, which may contribute to PAH.[1]\nThe N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT pro-BNP) may be monitored in those with PAH and is prognostic.\nA right heart catheterization to measure right heart pressure is required for the diagnosis of PAH. PAH is definitively diagnosed with a right heart catheterization showing a mean pulmonary arterial pressure greater than 20 mmHg at rest, with a pulmonary vascular resistance being 3 Woods Units or greater (indicative of pulmonary hypertension in the pre-capillary vasculature; the arteries and arterioles), and a pulmonary artery wedge pressure being less than 15 mmHg (excluding post-capillary pulmonary hypertension; elevated pressures distal to the pulmonary capillary bed which may be seen in left heart disease). Inhaled nitric oxide (a potent vasodilator) or other vasodilators (adenosine, prostaglandin I2) are infused during the right heart catheterization to see if the PAH is responsive to vasodilators which may guide treatment decisions (use of calcium channel blockers).[2][1]\nVarious clinical tests, such as the 6-minute walk test (the distance a person is able to walk in 6 minutes) are used prognostically as well as to assess response to treatment.[1][2]",
    "Treatment": "Supportive care in those with PAH involves using diuretics as needed for fluid overload, supplemental oxygen for hypoxemia, following a low sodium diet, an exercise program (such as walking), and routine immunizations. Vasoconstricting medications (frequently found in cough, cold and sinus formulations) should be avoided. Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation programs may be used for symptom control, patient education and counselling.[1]\nAnticoagulation, once universally used for PAH, is now indicated in idiopathic PAH, and its use is evaluated based on patient factors.[1]\nDisease specific therapy for PAH has improved disease free survival, symptom scores and mortality. Treatments consist of targeting the various aberrant pathways involved in the disease. For those with moderate to severe disease, dual therapy targeting at least 2 different disease specific pathways is indicated. Dual therapy is associated with greater mortality and disease free survival benefits over monotherapy.[1][2]\nPDE5 inhibitors (including sildenafil and tadalafil are used to dilate blood vessels by inhibiting the degradation of Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). cGMP inhibits pulmonary artery smooth muscle proliferation and causes pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell relaxation, thus acting as a vasodilator.[2]\nRiociguat also causes vasodilation by stimulating cGMP production.[2]\nEndothelin receptor antagonists cause vasodilation as well by blocking the action of the potent vasoconstrictor and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation activator endothelin-1. Bosentan inhibits endothelin-1 by blocking its action at the ETA and ETB receptors. Ambrisentan and sitaxsentan block endothelin-1 activity by selectively blocking the ETA receptor.[1][4]\nProstacyclins and prostacyclin agonists also cause vasodilation and also inhibit platelet aggregation. Epoprostenol, treprostinil and iloprost act as prostacyclin I2 (PGI2) analogues by binding to and activating the prostacyclin receptor to cause vasodilation. PGI2 activates adenylate cyclase to convert adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), cAMP inhibits proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the pulmonary artery walls, and causes relaxation of smooth muscle cells thus acting as a vasodilator. Selexipag acts as a PGI2 receptor agonist to also activate adenylate cyclase. Epoprostenol and treprostinil are given as continuous intravenous infusions. Treprostinil is also available as an inhaled form, as is iloprost.[2][1][4]\nIn those who have a sustained vasodilator response as determined during the right heart catheterization (approximately 10% of those with PAH are responders), long acting calcium channel blockers nifedipine, diltiazem or amlodipine are indicated.[1][4]\nIn disease that is refractory to medical therapy, an atrial septostomy may be used palliatively or as a bridge to lung transplantation.[1]",

    "Disease": "Pulmonary artery sling",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Patients with PAS often become symptomatic in infancy or early childhood with the majority presenting within the first year of life.[13] The condition typically causes airway compression due to the abnormal origin and course of the left pulmonary artery (LPA), which passes between the trachea and esophagus. Most symptoms are not specific, however, common symptoms can include: mild tachypnea, respiratory distress, stridor, wheezing, recurrent respiratory infections, feeding difficulties, cyanosis (especially in severe cases).[1]\nBecause PAS is an anatomical defect and frequently associated with other congenital anomalies advanced imaging is essential for accurate diagnosis and evaluation.\nAll patients with PAS should undergo cross-sectional imaging such as CT or MRI to define vascular anatomy and identify associated anomalies. Given the common association with tracheal stenosis and complete tracheal rings, bronchoscopy is necessary to assess airway anatomy, mucosal detail, dynamic changes, and extrinsic compression.[4] However, significant narrowing may limit the bronchoscope's ability to pass beyond the stenotic segment—making CT crucial for evaluating the distal airway.\nMost diagnosis of PAS are made from echocardiography.[12] An echocardiogram is also indicated to assess for associated congenital heart defects, which are present in a significant number of cases.[9] While PAS is often first detected on echocardiography, a full diagnostic work-up—including CT, bronchoscopy, and echocardiography—is essential for surgical planning and management.",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "N/A",
    "Treatment": "Early recognition of PAS is essential, as the severity of airway obstruction can vary and may necessitate surgical intervention. Surgery is typically performed via open-heart approach through a median sternotomy.[4] All patients diagnosed with PAS should undergo a comprehensive preoperative work-up to determine the need and timing for surgical repair. The majority of surgical repairs are performed in neonates and infants, particularly those with congenital tracheal stenosis. The median age at surgery is between 7 and 9 months, though the range can span from 6 days to 27 months.[7][12]\nThe primary goal of PAS is to LPA so that it no longer passes between the trachea and esophagus, thereby relieving airway compression. It is also critical to maintain adequate and durable blood flow to the left lung. Associated anomalies, such as congenital tracheal stenosis or intracardiac defects, can often be addressed during the same surgical procedure.\nThere are two main techniques are used for surgical correction of PAS: (1) reimplantation of the LPA into the main pulmonary artery and (2) tracheal transection with LPA translocation. Surgical access can be achieved via median sternotomy or a left thoracotomy approach.[12]  A 2012 study demonstrated that PAS is best repaired using a median sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass, and left pulmonary artery (LPA) reimplantation, which resulted in uniformly patent LPAs in all patients.[9]",

    "Disease": "Pulmonary hypertension",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The symptoms of pulmonary hypertension include the following:[2][13][16]\nLess common signs/symptoms include a non-productive cough and exercise-induced nausea and vomiting.[13] Coughing up of blood may occur in some patients, particularly those with specific subtypes of pulmonary hypertension such as heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension, Eisenmenger syndrome, and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.[17] Pulmonary venous hypertension typically presents with shortness of breath while lying flat or sleeping (orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea), while pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) typically does not.[18]\nOther typical signs of pulmonary hypertension include an accentuated pulmonary component of the second heart sound, a right ventricular third heart sound, and parasternal heave indicating a hypertrophied right ventricle. Signs of systemic congestion resulting from right-sided heart failure include jugular venous distension, ascites, and hepatojugular reflux.[13][16][19] Evidence of tricuspid insufficiency and pulmonic regurgitation is also sought and, if present, is consistent with the presence of pulmonary hypertension.[13][16][20]",
    "Cause": "Pulmonary hypertension is a pathophysiologic condition with many possible causes. Indeed, this condition frequently accompanies severe heart or lung conditions.[13] A 1973 World Health Organization meeting was the first attempt to classify pulmonary hypertension by its cause, and a distinction was made between primary PH (resulting from a disease of the pulmonary arteries) and secondary PH (resulting secondary to other, non-vascular causes). Further, primary PH was divided into the \"arterial plexiform\", \"veno-occlusive\", and \"thromboembolic\" forms.[21] In 1998, a second conference at Évian-les-Bains addressed the causes of secondary PH.[22] Subsequent third,[23] fourth,[11] and fifth (2013)[12] World Symposia on PAH have further defined the classification of PH.  The classification continues to evolve based on improved understanding of the disease mechanisms.[citation needed]\nMost recently in 2022, the WHO guidelines were updated by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and European Respiratory Society (ERS).[4] These guidelines are endorsed by the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, and provide the current framework for understanding and treatment of pulmonary hypertension.[4]",
    "Diagnosis": "In terms of diagnosing pulmonary hypertension, it has five major types, and a series of tests must be performed to distinguish pulmonary arterial hypertension from venous, hypoxic, thromboembolic, or unclear multifactorial varieties. PAH is diagnosed after exclusion of other possible causes of pulmonary hypertension.[16]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment of pulmonary hypertension is determined by whether the PH is arterial, venous, hypoxic, thromboembolic, or miscellaneous. If it is caused by left heart disease, the treatment is to optimize left ventricular function by the use of medication or to repair/replace the mitral valve or aortic valve.[69] Patients with left heart failure or hypoxemic lung diseases (groups II or III pulmonary hypertension) should not routinely be treated with vasoactive agents including prostanoids, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, or endothelin antagonists, as these are approved for the different condition called primary pulmonary arterial hypertension.[70] To make the distinction, doctors at a minimum will conduct cardiac catheterization of the right heart, echocardiography, chest CT, a seven-minute walk test, and pulmonary function testing.[70] Using treatments for other kinds of pulmonary hypertension in patients with these conditions can harm the patient and wastes substantial medical resources.[70]\nHigh-dose calcium channel blockers are useful in only 5% of IPAH patients who are vasoreactive by Swan-Ganz catheter. Calcium channel blockers have been largely misused, being prescribed to many patients with non-vasoreactive PAH, leading to excess morbidity and mortality.[20] The criteria for vasoreactivity have changed. Only those patients whose mean pulmonary artery pressure falls by more than 10 mm Hg to less than 40 mm Hg with an unchanged or increased cardiac output when challenged with adenosine, epoprostenol, or nitric oxide are considered vasoreactive.[71] Of these, only half of the patients are responsive to calcium channel blockers in the long term.[72]\nSeveral agents have recently been introduced for primary and secondary PAH. The trials supporting the use of these agents have been relatively small, and the only measure consistently used to compare their effectiveness is the \"six-minute walk test\". Many have no data on mortality benefit or time to progression.[73]\nSotatercept (Winrevair) was approved for medical use in the United States in March 2024.[74]   Keros Therapeutics has decided to end a mid-stage trial of its experimental treatment, cibotercept, after identifying safety concerns, including fluid buildup around the heart in patients with PAH.[75] Keros had aimed to compete with Merck's FDA-approved PAH drug, Sotatercept.\nExercise-based rehabilitation\nA 2023 Cochrane review found that exercise-based rehabilitation may lead to a large increase in exercise capacity and an improvement in health related quality of life, without significantly increasing adverse events.[76]",

    "Disease": "Pulmonary hypoplasia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "N/A",
    "Cause": "Causes of pulmonary hypoplasia include a wide variety of congenital malformations and other conditions in which pulmonary hypoplasia is a complication.[1]  These include congenital diaphragmatic hernia, congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation, fetal hydronephrosis, caudal regression syndrome, mediastinal tumor, and sacrococcygeal teratoma with a large component inside the fetus.[3][4][5][6]  Large masses of the neck (such as cervical teratoma) can also cause pulmonary hypoplasia, presumably by interfering with the fetus's ability to fill its lungs.  In the presence of pulmonary hypoplasia, the EXIT procedure to rescue a baby with a neck mass is not likely to succeed.[7]\nFetal hydrops can be a cause,[8] or conversely a complication.[9]\nPulmonary hypoplasia is associated with oligohydramnios through multiple mechanisms. Both conditions can result from blockage of the urinary bladder.  Blockage prevents the bladder from emptying, and the bladder becomes very large and full.  The large volume of the full bladder interferes with the normal development of other organs, including the lungs.  Pressure within the bladder becomes abnormally high, causing abnormal function in the kidneys; hence, abnormally high pressure in the vascular system enters the kidneys.  This high pressure also interferes with normal development of other organs.  An experiment in rabbits showed that PH also can be caused directly by oligohydramnios.[10]\nPulmonary hypoplasia is associated with dextrocardia of embryonic arrest in that both conditions can result from early errors of development, resulting in Congenital cardiac disorders.\nPH is a common direct cause of neonatal death resulting from pregnancy induced hypertension.[11]",
    "Diagnosis": "Medical diagnosis of pulmonary hypoplasia in utero may use imaging, usually ultrasound or MRI.[12][13]  The extent of hypoplasia is a very important prognostic factor.[14]  One study of 147 fetuses (49 normal, 98 with abnormalities) found that a simple measurement, the ratio of chest length to trunk (torso) length, was a useful predictor of postnatal respiratory distress.[15]  In a study of 23 fetuses, subtle differences seen on MRIs of the lungs were informative.[16]  In a study of 29 fetuses with suspected pulmonary hypoplasia, the group that responded to maternal oxygenation had a more favorable outcome.[17]\nPulmonary hypoplasia is diagnosed also clinically.",
    "Treatment": "N/A",
    "Management": "Management has three components:  interventions before delivery, timing and place of delivery, and therapy after delivery.\nIn some cases, fetal therapy is available for the underlying condition;  this may help to limit the severity of pulmonary hypoplasia.  In exceptional cases, fetal therapy may include fetal surgery.[18][19]\nA 1992 case report of a baby with a sacrococcygeal teratoma (SCT) reported that the SCT had obstructed the outlet of the urinary bladder causing the bladder to rupture in utero and fill the baby's abdomen with urine (a form of ascites).  The outcome was good.  The baby had normal kidneys and lungs, leading the authors to conclude that obstruction occurred late in the pregnancy and to suggest that the rupture may have protected the baby from the usual complications of such an obstruction.[20]  Subsequent to this report, use of a vesicoamniotic shunting procedure (VASP) has been attempted, with limited success.[21][22][23]\nOften, a baby with a high risk of pulmonary hypoplasia will have a planned delivery in a specialty hospital such as (in the United States) a tertiary referral hospital with a level 3 neonatal intensive-care unit.  The baby may require immediate advanced resuscitation and therapy.[24]\nEarly delivery may be required in order to rescue the fetus from an underlying condition that is causing pulmonary hypoplasia.  However, pulmonary hypoplasia increases the risks associated with preterm birth, because once delivered the baby requires adequate lung capacity to sustain life.  The decision whether to deliver early includes a careful assessment of the extent to which delaying delivery may increase or decrease the pulmonary hypoplasia.  It is a choice between expectant management and active management.    An example is congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation with hydrops;  impending heart failure may require a preterm delivery.[25]  Severe oligohydramnios of early onset and long duration, as can occur with early preterm rupture of membranes, can cause increasingly severe PH;  if delivery is postponed by many weeks, PH can become so severe that it results in neonatal death.[26]\nAfter delivery, most affected babies will require supplemental oxygen.  Some severely affected babies may be saved with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).[27] Not all specialty hospitals have ECMO, and ECMO is considered the therapy of last resort for pulmonary insufficiency.[28]  An alternative to ECMO is high-frequency oscillatory ventilation.[29]"

    "Disease": "Purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency",
    "Signs and symptoms": "In addition to the symptoms associated with immunodeficiency, such as depletion of T-cells, decline of lymphocyte activity, and an abrupt proliferation of both benign and opportunistic infections—PNP-deficiency is often characterized by the development of autoimmune disorders. lupus erythematosus, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura have been reported with PNP-deficiency.[2] Neurological symptoms, such as developmental decline, hypotonia, and mental retardation have also been reported.[citation needed]",
    "Cause": "The disorder is caused by a mutation of the purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) gene, located at chromosome 14q13.1.[3][4] This mutation was first identified by Eloise Giblett, a professor at the University of Washington, in 1975.[5] PNP is a key enzyme in the purine catabolic[6] pathway, and is required for purine degradation. Specifically, it catalyzes the conversion of inosine to hypoxanthine and guanosine to guanine (both guanine and hypoxanthine will be made into xanthine which will then become uric acid). A deficiency of it leads to a buildup of elevated deoxy-GTP (dGTP) levels resulting in T-cell toxicity and deficiency.[4][7] In contrast to adenosine deaminase deficiency (another deficiency of purine metabolism), there is minimal disruption to B cells.[8]\nPNP deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.[1] This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome (chromosome 14 is an autosome), and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is based on the clinical examination and on laboratory findings showing leukopenia, severe lymphopenia with low CD3, CD4, and CD8 counts and variable B cell function and immunoglobulin levels. Neutropenia has also been reported. Hallmark diagnostic markers of PNP deficiency include hypouricemia, complete or near complete absence of PNP activity in red blood cell lysate and increased urine or blood levels of inosine, guanosine and their deoxy forms. Diagnosis is confirmed by genetic screening of PNP.[citation needed]",

    "Signs and symptoms": "Pycnodysostosis causes the bones to be abnormally dense; the last bones of the fingers (the distal phalanges) to be unusually short; and delays the normal closure of the connections (sutures) of the skull bones in infancy, so that the \"soft spot\" (fontanelle) on top of the head remains widely open.[10] Because of the bone denseness, those with the syndrome suffer from fractures.[7]\nThose with the syndrome have brittle bones which easily break, especially in the legs and feet.\nOther abnormalities involve the head and face, teeth, collar bones, skin, and nails. The front and back of the head are prominent. Within the open sutures of the skull, there may be many small bones (called wormian bones). The midface is less full than usual. The nose is prominent. The jaw can be small. The palate is narrow and grooved. There will be delay in fall of milk teeth. The permanent teeth can also be slow to appear. The permanent teeth are commonly irregular and teeth may be missing (hypodontia). The collar bones are often underdeveloped and malformed. The nails are flat, grooved, and dysplastic. High bone density, acro-osteolysis and obtuse mandibular angle are the characteristic radiological findings of this disorder.[11]\nPycnodysostosis also causes problems that may become evident with time. Aside from the broken bones, the distal phalanges and the collar bone can undergo slow progressive deterioration. Vertebral defects may permit the spine to curve laterally resulting in scoliosis. The dental problems often require orthodontic care and cavities are common.\nPatients with PYCD are at a high risk of severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) due to upper airway obstructions.[12] OSA must be managed to prevent long term pulmonary complications.[12]\nAmongst infrequent complications, attention should be paid to maxillofacial anomalies. Snoring can be one of the presenting complaints and this needs early evaluation and management of obstructive sleep apnea if present to prevent long term pulmonary complications.",

Molecular testing will be the final resort to confirm the diagnosis.

It can also be part of autoinflammatory syndromes such as PAPA syndrome.[10][11]  Marzano et al. (2017) identified a variety of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to autoinflammation that were carried, singly or in combination, in subsets of patients with pyoderma gangrenosum, acne and suppurative hidradenitis syndrome (PASH syndrome) or isolated pyoderma gangrenosum of the ulcerative subtype.[14]\nOne hallmark of pyoderma gangrenosum is pathergy, which is the appearance of new lesions at sites of trauma.[15]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis of PG is challenging owing to its variable presentation, clinical overlap with other conditions, association with several systemic diseases, and absence of defining histopathologic or laboratory findings. Misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis are common. It has been shown that up to 39% of patients who initially received a diagnosis of PG have an alternative diagnosis.[16] In light of this, validated diagnostic criteria have recently been developed for ulcerative pyoderma gangrenosum.[17]",
    "Treatment": "First-line therapy for disseminated or localized instances of pyoderma gangrenosum is systemic treatment with corticosteroids and ciclosporin. Topical application of clobetasol, mupirocin, and gentamicin alternated with tacrolimus can be effective. Pyoderma gangrenosum ulcers demonstrate pathergy, that is, a worsening in response to minor trauma or surgical debridement. Significant care should be taken with dressing changes to prevent potentially rapid wound growth. Many patients respond differently to different types of treatment, for example, some benefit from a moist environment, so treatment should be carefully evaluated at each stage.[citation needed]\nIf ineffective, alternative therapeutic procedures include systemic treatment with corticosteroids and mycophenolate mofetil; mycophenolate mofetil and ciclosporin; tacrolimus; thalidomide; infliximab; or plasmapheresis.[18]",

    "Disease": "Rat-bite fever",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Symptoms are different for every person depending on the type of rat-bite fever with which the person is infected. Both spirillary and streptobacillary rat-bite fever have a few individual symptoms, although most symptoms are shared. Streptobacillosis is most commonly found in the United States and spirillary rat-bite fever is generally diagnosed in Africa. Rat-bite symptoms are visually seen in most cases and include inflammation around the open sore. A rash can also spread around the area and appear red or purple.[1] Other symptoms associated with streptobacillary rat-bite fever include chills, fever, vomiting, headaches, and muscle aches. Joints can also become painfully swollen and pain can be experienced in the back. Skin irritations such as ulcers or inflammation can develop on the hands and feet. Wounds heal slowly, so symptoms possibly come and go over the course of a few months.\nSymptoms associated with spirillary rat-bite fever include issues with the lymph nodes, which often swell or become inflamed as a reaction to the infection. The most common locations of lymph node swelling are in the neck, groin, and underarm.[2] Symptoms generally appear within two to ten days of exposure to the infected animal. It begins with the fever and progresses to the rash on the hands and feet within two to four days. The rash appears all over the body with this form but rarely causes joint pain.",
    "Cause": "Two types of Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic bacteria can cause the infection.",
    "Diagnosis": "This condition is diagnosed by detecting the bacteria in skin, blood, joint fluid, or lymph nodes. Blood antibody tests may also be used.[3] To get a proper diagnosis for rat-bite fever, different tests are run depending on the symptoms being experienced.\nTo diagnosis streptobacillary rat-bite fever, blood or joint fluid is extracted and the organisms living in it are cultured. Diagnosis for spirillary rat bite fever is by direct visualization or culture of spirilla from blood smears or tissue from lesions or lymph nodes.[4]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment should begin with assessment and management of the bite wound. The wound should be well irrigated. Although rats and small rodents are rarely infected with rabies, the individual must seek medical attention for possible tetanus or rabies post-exposure prophylaxis. Antibiotic therapy should be started immediately as laboratory confirmation may take a few days. Once results are obtained, therapy can be adjusted according to the antimicrobial susceptibility. Lack of treatment is highly associated with an increased risk of death. [6]\nThe treatment for rat-bite fever is consistent regardless of the bacterial cause. Intravenous penicillin is traditionally the treatment for uncomplicated cases of rat-bite fever, however intravenous ceftriaxone may also be used.  The dose and duration of antibiotic treatment depends on the clinical presentation and severity. If the patient improves after 5-7 days, they may transition to oral penicillin, ampicillin, or amoxicillin to complete a 14 day course therapy. If allergic to penicillin, cephalosporins such as cephalexin may be used. If allergic to both penicillin and cephalosporins, doxycycline may be used. [6]\nWhen treating children, Penicillin G procaine can be administered intramuscularly, or penicillin G can be given intravenously for 7 to 10 days. In uncomplicated cases, the patient may switch to oral penicillin after completing a 5-day course of intravenous penicillin G to complete the full 10-day course of antibiotics. For those with severe allergic reactions to penicillin, doxycycline or streptomycin can be used as alternatives. In cases of endocarditis, high-dose intravenous penicillin G is required for at least 4 weeks. Streptomycin or gentamicin can also be utilized for initial therapy in severe infections, including endocarditis. [7]",

    "Disease": "Refsum disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Individuals with Refsum disease present with neurologic damage, cerebellar degeneration, and peripheral neuropathy. Most cases are symmetric (affecting the left and right sides of the body equally) and feature both motor and sensory nerve deficits with similar time of onset and rate of disease progression.[8] Onset is most commonly in childhood or adolescence with a progressive course, although periods of stagnation or remission do occur. Rarely, symptoms may not appear until adulthood.[8] Common symptoms include dry, scaly skin; difficulty hearing; variable (but typically significant) muscle weakness; anosmia, which is the loss of sense of smell; and eye problems, including retinitis pigmentosa, cataracts, and night blindness.[9][8] Cerebellar ataxia is also common but usually presents later in life than other symptoms.[8] In 80 percent of patients diagnosed with Refsum disease, sensorineural hearing loss has been reported. This is hearing loss as the result of damage to the inner ear or the nerve connecting ear to the brain.[10]\nApproximately 30% of patients with Refsum disease are known to have congenital malformations of bones. The metatarsal and metacarpal bones are the most commonly affected, often being shorter than normal. In theory, this might be the earliest observable symptom of Refsum disease, but such abnormalities are often nonspecific or too minor to be noticed.[8]\nRarely, patients with Refsum disease may develop a cardiac arrhythmia. There is evidence that the risk of cardiac problems may increase following an infection or catecholamine-related illness, but this is not firmly established.[8]",
    "Cause": "Refsum disease is a peroxisomal disorder caused by the impaired alpha-oxidation of branched chain fatty acids resulting in buildup of phytanic acid and its derivatives in the plasma and tissues. This may be due to deficiencies of phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase or peroxin-7 activity, encoded by the genes PHYH[11] and PEX7,[12] respectively. In at least 90% of cases, Refsum disease is caused by PHYH mutations.[1][8][13]\nPEX7 gene mutations can interrupt the peroxisomal transport of proteins as this gene codes for the peroxin-7 protein receptor. These mutations in the PEX7 gene generally lead to rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1, which impairs development of many parts of the body.[14] Refsum disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that it requires both copies of the mutation to inherit the disease.[8]",
    "Diagnosis": "Histopathologic examination of the skin from a suspected patient commonly shows hyperkeratosis, hyper-granulosis and acanthosis. The presence of cells in the basal and suprabasal layers of the epidermis containing variably sized vacuoles with accumulated lipids is pathognomonic for the disease.[15]",
    "Treatment": "Since phytanic acid is not endogenously produced in the human body, individuals with Refsum disease are commonly placed on a phytanic-acid–restricted diet and avoid the consumption of fats from ruminant animals and certain fish, such as tuna, cod, and haddock.[9][17] Grass feeding animals and their milk are also avoided.[16] Recent research has shown that CYP4 isoform enzymes could help reduce the over-accumulation of phytanic acid in vivo.[18] Plasmapheresis is another medical intervention used to treat patients. This involves the filtering of blood to ensure there is no accumulation of phytanic acid.[16]",

    "Disease": "Retinoblastoma",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Retinoblastoma is the most intrusive intraocular cancer among children. The chance of survival and preservation of the eye depends fully on the severity. Retinoblastoma is extremely rare as there are only about 200 to 300 cases every year in the United States. Globally, only 1 in about 15,000 children have this malignancy, though rates continue to increase.[3]\nIntraocular malignancies are relatively more frequently treated than extraocular malignancies, likely due to a relatively earlier detection and subsequent treatment. Pediatricians may screen infants with annual vision tests, in which anomalies can be detected. During a red reflex test, light from an ophthalmoscope goes through transparent parts of the eye and reflects off the ocular fundus. If retinoblastoma is present, it may partially or fully impede light transversing this path. This may result in an abnormal red reflex or leucocoria, which can be a common indicator of retinoblastoma (when light is reflected by the tumor, the regular view of the red retina is blocked). The retinoblastoma may be visible as a whitish, translucent mass.[8] If the tumor has not spread and is contained within the eye, chances of successful treatment are favorable. If initial signs are ignored or diagnosis is significantly delayed, outcomes and prognosis worsen. The effects of retinoblastoma may spread outside the eye, sometimes resulting in proptosis. Retinoblastoma that has spread may be significantly more difficult to treat.[9]\nThe most common and obvious sign of retinoblastoma is an abnormal appearance of the retina as viewed through the pupil, the medical term for which is leukocoria, also known as amaurotic cat's eye reflex.[5] Other signs and symptoms include deterioration of vision, a red and irritated eye with glaucoma, and faltering growth or delayed development. Some children with retinoblastoma can develop a squint,[10] commonly referred to as \"cross-eyed\" or \"wall-eyed\" (strabismus). Retinoblastoma presents with advanced disease in developing countries and eye enlargement is a common finding.[11]\nDepending on the position of the tumors, they may be visible during a simple eye examination using an ophthalmoscope to look through the pupil. A positive diagnosis is usually made only with an examination under anesthetic (EUA). A white eye reflection is not always a positive indication of retinoblastoma and can be caused by light being reflected badly[12] or by other conditions such as Coats' disease.[13]\nThe presence of the photographic fault red eye in only one eye and not in the other may be a sign of retinoblastoma. A clearer sign is \"white eye\" or \"cat's eye\" (leukocoria).[14]",
    "Cause": "Mutation of genes, found in chromosomes, can affect the way in which cells grow and develop within the body.[15] Alterations in RB1 or MYCN can give rise to retinoblastoma.",
    "Diagnosis": "Screening for retinoblastoma should be part of a \"well baby\" screening for newborns during the first 3 months of life, to include:[27]\n• The red reflex: checking for a normal reddish-orange reflection from the eye's retina with an ophthalmoscope or retinoscope from about 30 cm or 1 foot, usually done in a dimly lit or dark room\n• The corneal light reflex or Hirschberg test: checking for symmetrical reflection of beam of light in the same spot on each eye when a light is shined into each cornea, to help determine whether the eyes are crossed\n• Eye examination: checking for any structural abnormalities",
    "Treatment": "The priority of retinoblastoma treatment is to preserve the life of the child, then to preserve vision, and then to minimize complications or side effects of treatment. The exact course of treatment depends on the individual case and is decided by the ophthalmologist in discussion with the paediatric oncologist.[40] Correct treatment also depends on the mutation type, whether it is a germline RB1 mutation, a sporadic RB1 mutation or MYCN amplification with functional RB1.[41] Children with involvement of both eyes at diagnosis usually require multimodality therapy (chemotherapy, local therapies).\nThe various treatment modalities for retinoblastoma includes:[40][42][43]\n• Enucleation of the eye – Most patients with unilateral disease present with advanced intraocular disease, so usually undergo enucleation, which results in a cure rate of 95%. In bilateral Rb, enucleation is usually reserved for eyes that have failed all known effective therapies or without useful vision.\n• External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) – The most common indication for EBRT is for the eye in a young child with bilateral retinoblastoma who has active or recurrent disease after completion of chemotherapy and local therapies. However, patients with hereditary disease who received EBRT therapy are reported to have a 35% risk of second cancers.[44]\n• Brachytherapy involves the placement of a radioactive implant (plaque), usually on the sclera adjacent to the base of a tumor. It is used as the primary treatment, or more frequently, in patients with small tumors or in those who had failed initial therapy including previous EBRT therapy.\n• Thermotherapy involves the application of heat directly to the tumor, usually in the form of infrared radiation. It is also used for small tumors.\n• Laser photocoagulation  is recommended only for small posterior tumors. An argon or diode laser or a xenon arc is used to coagulate all the blood supply to the tumor.\n• Cryotherapy induces damage to the vascular endothelium with secondary thrombosis and infarction of the tumor tissue by rapidly freezing it. It may be used as primary therapy for small peripheral tumors or for small recurrent tumors previously treated with other methods.\n• Systemic chemotherapy has become forefront of treatment in the past decade, in the search for globe-preserving measures and to avoid the adverse effects of EBRT therapy. The common indications for chemotherapy for intraocular retinoblastoma include tumors that are large and that cannot be treated with local therapies alone in children with bilateral tumors. It is also used in patients with unilateral disease when the tumors are small, but cannot be controlled with local therapies alone.\n• Intra-arterial chemotherapy – Chemotherapeutic drugs are administered locally by a thin catheter threaded through the groin, through the aorta, and the neck, directly into the optic vessels.[45]\n• Nanoparticulate chemotherapy – To reduce the adverse effects of systemic therapy, subconjuctival (local) injection of nanoparticle carriers containing chemotherapeutic agents (carboplatin) has been developed, which has shown promising results in the treatment of retinoblastoma in animal models without adverse effects.[46][47]\n• Chemoreduction is a combined approach using chemotherapy to initially reduce the size of the tumor, and adjuvant focal treatments, such as transpupillary thermotherapy, to control the tumor.[48][49]",

    "Disease": "Retinopathy of prematurity",
    "Signs and symptoms": "N/A",
    "Cause": "By the fourth month of pregnancy, the fetal retina has begun to develop vascularization. Such formation of blood vessels appears to be very sensitive to the amount of oxygen supplied, either naturally or artificially. In rare cases ROP has been found in some patients with a mutation in the NDP gene, which is normally associated with the more damaging Norrie disease.[3][4][5]",
    "Diagnosis": "The stages of ROP disease have been defined by the International Classification of Retinopathy of Prematurity (ICROP).\nIn older patients, the appearance of the disease is less well described but includes the residua of the ICROP stages as well as secondary retinal responses.",
    "Treatment": "• Peripheral retinal ablation is the mainstay of ROP treatment. The destruction of the avascular retina is performed with a solid state laser photocoagulation device, as these are easily portable to the operating room or neonatal ICU. Cryotherapy, an earlier technique in which regional retinal destruction was done using a probe to freeze the desired areas, has also been evaluated in multi-center clinical trials as an effective modality for prevention and treatment of ROP. However, when laser treatment is available, cryotherapy is no longer preferred for routine avascular retinal ablation in premature babies, due to the side effects of inflammation and lid swelling. Furthermore, recent trials have shown that treatment at an earlier stage of the disease gives better results.[16]\n• Scleral buckling and/or vitrectomy surgery may be considered for severe ROP (stages 4 and 5) for eyes that progress to retinal detachment. Few centers in the world specialize in this surgery, because of its attendant surgical risks and generally poor outcomes.\n• Intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (Avastin) has been reported as a supportive measure in aggressive posterior retinopathy of prematurity.[17] In a 2011 clinical trial comparing bevacizumab with conventional laser therapy, intravitreal bevacizumab monotherapy showed a significant benefit for zone I but not zone II disease when used to treat infants with stage 3+ retinopathy of prematurity.[18] Potential benefits of intravitreal Avastin injection over laser therapy include: reduction in level of anesthesia required, preservation of viable peripheral retina, and, possibly, reduced incidence of subsequent high refractive error. However, the safety of this new treatment has not yet been established in terms of ocular complications as well as systemic complications. The latter are theoretically possible, as the active ingredient of bevacizumab not only blocks the development of abnormal blood vessels in the eye but may also prevent the normal development ofother tissues such as the lung and kidney.  A 2018 Cochrane review also examined the effectiveness of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor drugs and their use for ROP.[19]\n• Oral propranolol is being evaluated for counteracting the progression of ROP, but safety is a concern. A prospective randomized trial in which pre-term newborns were randomized to receiving oral propranolol with standard treatment or standard treatment alone found that oral propranolol showed a 48% relative risk reduction for progression to stage 3, 58% reduction for progression to stage 3 plus, and 100% reduction for progression to stage 4. Furthermore, there was a 52% relative risk reduction for the need for laser treatment or intravitreal bevacizumab. However 19% of the newborns experienced serious adverse effects including hypotension and bradycardia.[20] A study in a mouse model of human ROP has shown that beta-blockade is protective against retinal angiogenesis and ameliorate blood-retinal barrier dysfunction.[21]",

One twin was affected with ROHHAD and developed symptoms, while the other twin developed normally.

    "Diagnosis": "Rapid obesity is the first symptom to arise between the ages of 1.5 and 11.

    "Treatment": "Attempting to control weight through diet and exercise can be exceedingly difficult in patients with ROHHAD due to a number of factors. Encouraging ROHHAD patients to exercise vigorously can be dangerous, as their breathing will not increase with exertion and this can cause hypoxia. Therefore, it is important for ROHHAD patients to exercise at a moderate intensity and for their oxygen levels to be monitored throughout. Typically, the obesity associated with ROHHAD is managed by preventing further weight gain as the child grows.[3]",
    "Management": "There is no known cure for ROHHAD, therefore treatment for the disease involves managing symptoms as they manifest in the patient. As not all ROHHAD patients develop the same symptoms, treatment plans vary between patients. Proper treatment of hypothalamic dysfunction and hypoventilation is the most critical aspect of ROHHAD management, as these symptoms have the greatest ability to cause death or behavioral problems if left uncontrolled.[5]"

Microscopic examination of stained specimens will show histiocytes with lymphocytes and possibly other types of cells trapped within them, a phenomenon known as emperipolesis.[1][7] Upon immunohistochemical staining, the histiocytes will be positive for S100, CD68, and CD163 but negative for CD1a.[1][7]",

Although the mechanism underlying the physiopathology of this syndrome is still unknown, it has been proposed that nectin-1 is a cell-cell adhesion molecule that is preferentially expressed in keratinocytes and that mutations in PVRL1 may abrogate NAP (nectin, afadin, ponsin)-dependent cell-cell adhesion. It is thought that the genetic transmission is autosomal recessive gene transmission.[8]\nThe cause was found in the year 2000 by Suzuki et al. when he analyzed the genome of patients with the disorder and discovered a homozygous nonsense mutation in the PVRL1 gene, in chromosome 11. It was suggested that the regular occurrence of this disorder among the people of Margarita Island was due to resistance to alpha-herpes viruses people carrying only one copy of the mutated gene (heterozygosity) had. The same mutation in the same gene was found in two families from the Middle East and South America (Israel and Brazil respectively.) by the same researchers (Suzuki et al.)",

The main symptom is a non-itching jaundice. There is a rise in bilirubin in the patient's serum, mainly of the conjugated type.[citation needed]\nIt can be differentiated from Dubin–Johnson syndrome in the following ways:[4]\nRotor syndrome may exacerbate toxic side effects of the medication irinotecan.[5]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "Increased conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is the hallmark for diagnosing Rotor syndrome. There is no distinct black pigmentation of the liver as seen in a similar, Dubin-Johnson Syndrome. Genes, SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3 that result in complete functional deficiencies of both protein products (OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, respectively), are also present.[citation needed]\nRotor syndrome is largely a diagnosis of exclusion.[2] Serological abnormalities in Rotor syndrome only include elevated total serum bilirubin (typically elevated between 2 and 5 mg/dL but may be as high as 20 mg/dL).[2]\nMost of the time, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and alkaline phosphatase levels are normal, but mild elevations can be seen.[2] If any of these lab values are markedly elevated, investigation for other, more serious conditions is warranted.[2]\nImaging studies cannot diagnose Rotor syndrome but can help rule out other diseases that cause hyperbilirubinemia.[2] For example, ultrasound of the liver and the biliary tree can help investigate the causes of extra-hepatic biliary obstruction.[2] The gallbladder is visualized on oral cholecystography in Rotor syndrome while it is not visualized in Dubin Johnson syndrome.[2] Ultimately, the best method of diagnosing the disease is the analysis of urine coproporphyrin excretion.[2] The total urine coproporphyrin excretion in Rotor syndrome has a 2- to 5-fold elevation, with 65% constituting coproporphyrin I.[2]",
    "Treatment": "Rotor syndrome is a benign disease requiring no treatment.[2] Jaundice is a lifelong finding, but the disease is not associated with morbidity or mortality, and life expectancy is not affected.[2] Most individuals with Rotor syndrome are born to consanguineous couples and its diagnosis may coincidently identify consanguinity.[2] Distinguishing Rotor syndrome from other more serious disorders is important to avoid unnecessary workup and interventions.[2] It is also critical to reassure and calm patients or family members of patients with Rotors syndrome that the condition is benign.[2]",

The syndrome was first observed in Sabinas, a small community in northern Mexico.\nThe principal biochemical features of the illness are reduced hair cystine levels, increased copper/zinc ratio, and presence of arginosuccinic acid in the blood and urine.[2]\nThe key finding is brittle hair with low sulfur content, but alternating dark and light bands under polarizing microscopy, trichoschisis, and absent or defective cuticle are additional important clues for the diagnosis of trichothiodystrophy.  Review of literature reveals extensive associated findings in trichothiodystrophy. Amino acid analyses of control hair when compared with those of patients with the Sabinas syndrome showed very striking differences with regard to content of sulphur amino acids. As in previous descriptions of amino acid abnormalities in the trichorrhexis nodosa of arginosuccinicaciduria, there were increases in lysine, aspartic acid, alanine, leucine, isoleucine, and tyrosine.\nTrichothiodystrophy represents a central pathologic feature of a specific hair dysplasia associated with several disorders in organs derived from ectoderm and neuroectoderm. Trichothiodystrophy or TTD is a heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive disorders, characterized by abnormally sulfur deficient brittle hair and accompanied by ichthyosis and other manifestations.\nPatients with trichothiodystrophy should have a thorough evaluation for other associated manifestations, including investigation of photosensitivity and DNA repair defects. Because the disease appears to be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, detection of low-sulfur brittle hair syndrome is also important for genetic counseling.[3]",

In some cases, where only a small part of the spine is absent, there may be no outward sign of the condition. In cases where more substantial areas of the spine are absent, there may be fused, webbed or smaller lower extremities and paralysis. Bowel and bladder control is usually affected.[citation needed]",
    "Cause": "The condition arises from some factor or set of factors present during approximately the 3rd week to 7th week of fetal development. Formation of the sacrum/lower back and corresponding nervous system is usually nearing completion by the 4th week of development. Due to abnormal gastrulation, the mesoderm migration is disturbed. This disturbance results in symptoms varying from minor lesions of the lower vertebrae to more severe symptoms such as complete fusion of the lower limbs. While the exact cause is unknown, it has been speculated that the condition has a combination of environmental and genetic causes, and that various types of the condition may have differing causes.[citation needed]\nSacral agenesis syndrome (a type of caudal regression syndrome involving agenesis of the lumbar spine, sacrum, and coccyx, and hypoplasia of the lower extremities) is a well-established congenital anomaly associated with maternal diabetes mellitus.[3][4] Other causes are presumably involved, as demonstrated by the rare overall incidence of caudal regression syndrome (1:60,000) compared to diabetes; however, the condition does have a greatly increased incidence among infants born to mothers with diabetes, estimated at 1 in 350 newborns of mothers with diabetes.[2]\nThe dominant inherited sacral agenesis (also referred to as Currarino syndrome) is very often correlated with a mutation in the Hb9 (also called HlxB9) gene.[5]\nIt was previously thought to be related to sirenomelia (\"Mermaid syndrome\") but has now been determined not to be related to this condition.[6]",

    "Signs and symptoms": "SCS presents in a variable fashion. The majority of individuals with SCS are moderately affected, with uneven facial features and a relatively flat face due to underdeveloped eye sockets, cheekbones, and lower jaw. In addition to the physical abnormalities, people with SCS also experience growth delays, which results in a relatively short stature. Although, most individuals with SCS are of normal intelligence, some individuals may have mild to moderate mental delays. More severe cases of SCS, with more serious facial deformities, occurs when multiple cranial sutures close prematurely.[2]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "N/A",
    "Treatment": "The physical abnormalities resulting from SCS are typically mild and only require a minor surgical procedure or no procedure at all. One of the common symptoms of SCS is the development of short (brachydactyly), webbed fingers and broad toes (syndactyly). These characteristics do not cause any problems to the function of the hands or feet, and thus, no medical procedure is required to fix the abnormalities, unless the patient requests it. Webbing of the fingers may affect the base of the fingers, resulting in delayed hand growth during childhood, but this contributes no functional impairments. Sometimes, individuals with SCS develop broad toes because the bones at the ends of the toes are duplicating themselves. This is especially seen in the big toe, but requires no surgical intervention because it doesn't negatively affect the overall function of the foot. Individuals with these toe abnormalities walk normally and can wear normal footwear.[9]\nIn more severe cases, frequent surgeries and clinical monitoring are required throughout development. A child born with asymmetrical unilateral coronal synostosis should undergo cranioplasty within its first year of life in order to prevent increased intracranial pressure and to prevent progressive facial asymmetry. Cranioplasty is a surgical procedure to correct prematurely fused cranial bones. The surgery acts to reconstruct and reposition the bones and sutures in order to promote the most normal growth.[6] Cranioplasty is necessary in order to continue to grow and is important for two main reasons. First of all, the skull needs to be able to accommodate the growing brain following childbirth, which it can't because the skull doesn't grow as fast as the brain as long as the sutures remain fused. This results in an increase in pressure surrounding the brain and inhibits the brain from growing, causing the individual to experience significant problems, and if left untreated can eventually lead to death. Secondly, cranioplasty may be required for appearance purposes.[7] This is especially the case in individuals with asymmetrical unilateral coronal synostosis, which requires reconstructive surgery of the face and skull. If cranioplasty is not performed, especially in individuals with unilateral coronal synostosis, then facial asymmetry will get worse and worse over time, which is why cranioplasty should be performed as soon as possible.[9]\nSurgery may also be required in individuals with vision problems. Vision problems usually arise due to a lack of space in the eye orbit and skull because of the abnormal bone structure of the face. Decreased space may also lead to abnormal or missing tear ducts and nerve damage. Reconstructive surgery is usually required in order to increase cranial space, correct tear duct stenosis, and/or correct ptosis of the eyelids in order to prevent amblyopia (lazy eye).[2]\nMidfacial surgery may also be required during early childhood to correct respiratory problems, dental malocclusion, and swallowing difficulties. A cleft palate is also corrected with surgery, and may involve the use of tympanostomy tubes. If needed, an individual will undergo orthognathic treatment and/or orthodontic treatment after facial development is complete.[2] Since hearing loss is frequently associated with SCS, it is recommended that audiology screening persist throughout childhood.[6]\nAfter cranial reconstructive surgery, a child may be required to wear a molding helmet or some other form of head protection until the cranial bones set into place. This typically takes about three months and depends on the child's age and the severity of the condition. Following recovery, individuals with SCS look and act completely normal, so no one would even be able to tell that they have SCS.[10]",

Individuals with Salla disease may present with nystagmus as well as hypotonia, and may have difficulty coordinating voluntary movements (ataxia), reduced muscle tone and strength, and cognitive impairment.[5] The most severely impaired children do not walk or acquire language, but the typical patient learns to walk and speak and has normal life expectancy. The MRI shows arrested or delayed myelination.[6]\nApproximately two-thirds of children with mild FSASD eventually learn to walk. Some degree of speech impairment is usually present. Affected infants may learn single words or small sentences, but this ability may be lost as they age. The ability to produce speech is affected more severely than the ability to understand speech. Affected children exhibit some degree of cognitive impairment as well.[citation needed]\nFSASD (Salla and Infantile Free Sialic Acid Storage Disease) affects males and females in equal numbers. The worldwide prevalence of FSASD is estimated at less than 1 per 1,000,000 individuals. Higher estimated prevalence rates occur in the Salla region of Finland and other Scandinavian countries.[citation needed]\nApproximately ~300 individuals with FSASD have been reported in the literature, of which the majority (> 160 cases) are of Finnish or Swedish ancestry.

    "Disease": "Sandhoff disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Sandhoff disease symptoms are clinically indeterminable from Tay–Sachs disease. The classic infantile form of the disease has the most severe symptoms and is incredibly hard to diagnose at this early age.[6]  The first signs of symptoms begin before 6 months of age and the parents' notice when the child begins regressing in their development.  If the children had the ability to sit up by themselves or crawl they will lose this ability.  This is caused by a slow deterioration of the muscles in the child's body from the buildup of GM2 gangliosides.  Since the body is unable to create the enzymes it needs within the central nervous system, it is unable to attach to these gangliosides to break them apart and make them non-toxic.  With this buildup there are several symptoms that begin to appear such as muscle/motor weakness, sharp reaction to loud noises, blindness, deafness, inability to react to stimulants, respiratory problems and infections, mental retardation, seizures, cherry red spots in the retina, enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), pneumonia, or bronchopneumonia.[7]\nThe other two forms of Sandhoff disease have similar symptoms but to a lesser extent.  Adult and juvenile forms of Sandhoff disease are more rare than the infantile form.[8] In these cases victims suffer cognitive impairment (retardation) and a loss of muscle coordination that impairs and eventually destroys their ability to walk; the characteristic red spots in the retina also develop. The adult form of the disease, however, is sometimes milder, and may only lead to muscle weakness that impairs walking or the ability to get out of bed.[9]",
    "Cause": "Two parents carrying a mutated gene and passing it on to their offspring cause the disease.  Even with both parents carrying the disease in their genome, there is only a 25% chance that they will have a child containing the genetic coding for the disease (see figure right).[10]\nEach form of the disease is caused by the differences in the various mutations of the genome, in particular the codons on the 14 exons in the HEX B gene located within chromosome 5 (see figure bottom), leading to the differences in severities of the symptoms.[6]  The difference in the codons has the consequence of inhibiting two enzymes located in the lysosomes of the neurons of the central nervous system. Lysosomes contain various enzymes to break down byproducts and toxins to ensure they do not accumulate enough to interfere with the function of the central nervous system.[7]\nUsing restriction enzymes, it was discovered that a mutation on chromosome 5 particularly within the C1214T allele caused the adult onset form of Sandhoff Disease. For the patient showing symptoms of the infantile or juvenile form they have a mutation on exon I207V from their father, and a 16 base pair deletion from their mother which can be located on as many as five exons, exons 1–5.[11]",
    "Diagnosis": "Sandhoff disease can be detected through the following procedures (before it is apparent through physical examination): a biopsy removing a sample of tissue from the liver, genetic testing, molecular analysis of cells and tissues (to determine the presence of a genetic metabolic disorder), enzyme assay, and occasionally a urinalysis to determine if the above-noted compounds are abnormally stored within the body. For a child to suffer from this disease, both parents must be carriers, and both must transmit the mutation to the child. Thus, even in the case where both parents have the mutation, there is only a 25 percent chance their child will inherit the condition. Frequently, parents are given the opportunity to have a DNA screening if they are at high risk, to determine their carrier status before they have children. However, it is also highly recommended to undergo testing even for those parents who do not have a family history of Sandhoff disease. Over 95% of the families that have children with Sandhoff disease had no known prior family history of the condition, as the mutation in the HEXB gene does not cause clinical symptoms when only one copy is present, and often passed undetected from one generation to the next[6] Naturally, if an individual carries the mutation, he or she has a risk of transmitting it to the unborn child. Genetic counseling is recommended for those who have the mutation.[citation needed]\nIt is possible for parents who are about to have a child or had a child with Sandhoff Disease can have a PGD or PEGD.  PEGD is pre-embryonic genetic diagnosis for the parents that would not benefit from a pre-implantation genetic diagnosis because of their religion or negative attitude for the discarding of embryos.  PEGD sequences the genome of the embryo to be produced by two parents if they were to conceive a child.  If the family has a history of Sandhoff disease it is recommended they have their genome sequenced to ensure they are not carriers or to sequence the genome of their child.[17]",
    "Treatment": "Currently Sandhoff disease does not have any standard treatment and does not have a cure. However, a person suffering from the disease needs proper nutrition, hydration, and maintenance of clear airways. To reduce some symptoms that may occur with Sandhoff disease, the patient may take anticonvulsants to manage seizures or medications to treat respiratory infections, and consume a precise diet consisting of puree foods due to difficulties swallowing. Infants with the disease usually die by the age of 3 due to respiratory infections. The patient must be under constant surveillance because they can suffer from aspiration or lack the ability to change from the passageway to their lungs versus their stomach and their spit travels to the lungs causing bronchopneumonia.  The patient also lacks the ability to cough and therefore must undergo a treatment to shake up their body to remove the mucus from the lining of their lungs.  Medication is also given to patients to lessen their symptoms including seizures.[citation needed]\nCurrently the government is testing several treatments including N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin in mice, as well as stem cell treatment in humans and other medical treatments recruiting test patients.[11] A Sandhoff disease study showing proof of principle for gene therapy in a human model system using CRISPR and virus gene correction gives the chance for clinical trials to cure the disease. The ultra-rare occurrence is a main hurdle to overcome for clinical trials.[22][23]",

    "Disease": "Sanfilippo syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The age of onset, severity, and progression of the disease can vary greatly between patients with different subtypes and within the same subtype. Development during the prenatal and early post-natal stages progresses normally.[4] Between the ages of one and four is when the disease typically manifests.[5] Affected infants appear normal, although some mild facial dysmorphism may be noticeable. Of all of the MPS diseases, Sanfilippo syndrome produces the fewest physical abnormalities. Possible clinical somatic symptoms, although rare, include coarse facial features with broad eyebrows, dark eyelashes, dry and rough hair, and skeletal pathology that affects growth.[6]\nAfter an initial symptom-free interval, symptoms may arise during the early years of development, from the age of one to three.[6] Children usually present with delayed cognitive development and behavioral problems, followed by progressive intellectual decline resulting in severe dementia and progressive motor disease.[7] Acquisition of speech is often slow and incomplete. Although delayed cognitive development may occur, it tends to be mild in individuals with Sanfilippo syndrome.[8]\nBetween the ages of three and ten, the disease progresses to increasing behavioral disturbance including temper tantrums, hyperactivity, destructive behavior, aggressive behavior, pica, difficulties with toilet training, and sleep disturbance.[2] As affected children initially have normal muscle strength and mobility, the behavioral disturbances may be difficult to manage. The disordered sleep in particular presents a significant problem to care providers.[9] People with this disorder may stay in this phase for five to ten years.[6] After that, the behavioral disturbances subside. However, patients start to become increasingly immobile and unresponsive, as individuals with Sanfilippo syndrome will gradually lose their motor skills, often require wheelchairs, and develop swallowing difficulties and seizures.[10] Persons with Sanfilippo syndrome tend to regress to an unresponsive or vegetative state until they pass away.[6] The life-span of a severely affected person does not usually extend beyond late teens to early twenties.[11] However, patients with less severe phenotypes of the disease have varied life spans, with some cases even surviving into their seventies.[9]\nThe most common symptoms seen in individuals with Sanfilippo syndrome are neurological and may include intellectual disabilities, impaired language development, abnormal movements, and trouble sleeping; however, other symptoms commonly seen are excessive hair growth, chronic ear infections, respiratory infections, and poor nutrient absorption.[12] Other signs less frequently seen in persons with Sanfilippo syndrome include behavioral changes and musculoskeletal changes such as increased muscle and joint stiffness and changes in bone growth or density.[12][2]\nChildren with Sanfilippo syndrome often have an increased tolerance to pain. Bumps, bruises, or ear infections that would be painful for other children often go unnoticed in children with Sanfilippo syndrome. Some children with Sanfilippo syndrome may have a blood-clotting problem during and after surgery.[5]\nIndividuals with Sanfilippo syndrome are born within normal physiological ranges. At around age 2, individuals with Sanfilippo syndrome are significantly taller than children without the condition.[13] By the age of 4, mostly male children with Sanfilippo syndrome were still taller than unaffected children.[13] Growth velocity decelerates dramatically after the age of 5, and by the time children with Sanfilippo syndrome reach 17, all individuals are significantly shorter than their reference groups.[13]\nIt is difficult to clinically distinguish symptomatic differences among the four types of Sanfilippo syndrome, although each of the types can vary in severity.[14] Type A is usually the most severe subtype, characterized by the earliest onset, rapid clinical progression with severe symptoms, and short survival, with patients' life expectancy averaging between 15 and 18 years old.[14] Type B is considered slightly less aggressive than type A, but still displays rapid clinical progression and short survival, with patients' life expectancy averaging between 17 and 19 years old.[14] Type C is considered the least aggressive form of Sanfilippo syndrome, with patients' average life expectancy between 19 and 34 years of age, depending on the study.[14] Type D is a rare subtype of Sanfilippo syndrome, and no data has been published on average life expectancy.[14]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "Sanfilippo syndrome types A, B, C, and D are considered to be clinically indistinguishable, although mutations in different genes are responsible for each disease. Another subtype has been identified, but it has only been found in mice.[14] The following discussion is therefore applicable to all four conditions. Thus, there are two main ways that can be used to confirm if an individual has Sanfilippo syndrome: a urinalysis and genetic testing.[23][2]\nA urinalysis can show elevated levels of heparan sulfate in the urine.[15] All four types of Sanfilippo syndrome show increased levels of GAGs in the urine, so there is no distinction between the Sanfilippo syndrome subtypes based on a urinalysis alone; however, in MPS IIIA and IIIB patients, the plasma and CSF were also found to be elevated.[24] Additionally, urinary GAG levels are higher in infants and toddlers than in older children. In order to avoid a false negative urine test due to dilution, it is important that a urine sample be taken first thing in the morning. The diagnosis may be confirmed by enzyme assay of skin fibroblasts and white blood cells, as well as gene sequencing. Through gene sequencing, known genetic defects can be detected in order to identify the disease.[23] Aside from confirming diagnosis, genetic testing is also recommended to determine carriers and to understand development of the disease.[9]\nThere are various stages in a child's life in which they can be diagnosed with Sanfilippo syndrome. Diagnosing a child prior to presentation of symptoms is integral for experimental treatments to be beneficial.[25] Prenatal diagnosis is possible by chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis.[26] Newborn diagnosis is also a possibility; however, no country has mandated testing for this specific disease. Testing for newborns includes examining their blood to locate the mutation.[25] Although there is no current standard, largely due to economical reasons, a whole genome sequencing may prove to be beneficial in the future. This method can shorten the route for accurate diagnosis, which can ultimate help the individual and their families.[23]\nA diagnosis of Sanfilippo syndrome should be considered by providers if a child presents with symptoms associated with other disorders such as behavioral or attention deficit disorders or autism spectrum disorder[10] as there is overlap of behaviors with these conditions.[27] Diagnosing individuals with Sanfilippo syndrome can be challenging because of the rarity of the disease and variability of the presentation in early symptoms and an accurate diagnosis may take years. Due to the neurological symptoms presented in Sanfilippo syndrome, misdiagnoses can occur, such as developmental delays, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnoses being made.[28] Moreover, other medical conditions that present with physical symptoms such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis or behavioral issues such as Landau–Kleffner syndrome can be mistaken for the disease and prevent early diagnosis of Sanfilippo. Additionally, screening for Sanfilippo syndrome is not a routine procedure, which can also delay a proper diagnosis to have the best possible management.[23]\nOnce a diagnosis has been made, it is important that children are monitored and seen regularly by their healthcare provider to assess the progression of disease, decline of normal function, and to identify other health issues associated with Sanfilippo syndrome such as cardiac, musculoskeletal, and gastrointestinal problems.[9] Testing to monitor disease progression includes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), x-rays, electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and abdominal imaging. These tests are more specifically used to determine the source of neurological pain, cognitive and behavioral changes, physical symptoms of pain, cardiac abnormalities, and symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Examples of routine monitoring includes physical, eye, ear, nutritional, and dental exams.[9]",
    "Treatment": "While treatment remains largely supportive, research advancements are being made in the fields of pharmacology, stem cell, and genetics to address the disease. Currently, there is no cure for any subtype of Sanfilippo syndrome.[17][29]\nSupportive therapies to manage Sanfilippo syndrome include the use of medications, physical therapy, medical equipment, surgery, and occupational therapy to treat behavioral and cognitive delays, musculoskeletal damage, and to improve overall quality of life.[2] Evidence for medications that effectively manage behavioral problems and seizures in children with Sanfilippo syndrome are limited.[2][9] Occupational and physical therapy can assist children with any movement restrictions. Staying up to date with vaccines against pneumococcal disease is also recommended due to the increased risk of contracting respiratory infections. Surgical interventions can be used to minimize ear infections, scoliosis, and other complications that occur during the disease progression. Due to the disease's impact on different organs and systems, healthcare professionals from various fields are involved and integral in managing the child's symptoms.[9]\nPharmacological interventions for the management of symptoms associated with Sanfilippo syndrome vary depending on the affected organ system. These may include gastrointestinal medications, antibiotics, anticholinergics, melatonin for sleep disorders, or neurological medications to help modify behaviors or control seizures.[9] It is important to note that behavioral disturbances of Sanfilippo syndrome may vary in response to medication, as each individual may react differently to the medications that are intended to treat the individual's mental state.[23] However, medication usage can still be pursued to treat an individual's symptoms instead of managing Sanfilippo syndrome to improve their quality of life.[citation needed]\nIf an early diagnosis is made, bone marrow replacement may be beneficial.[30] Patients that underwent bone marrow transplant before the age of two showed neurocognitive function stabilization.[31] Although the missing enzyme can be manufactured and given intravenously (also known as enzyme replacement therapy) to help treat other non-neurological lysosomal storage diseases and Sanfilippo syndrome with minor neurological impacts, it cannot penetrate the blood–brain barrier and therefore cannot treat the moderate to severe neurological manifestations of MPS-III.[16] Along with many other lysosomal storage diseases, MPS-III exists as a model of a monogenetic disease involving the central nervous system.[23]\nGene therapy in particular is under Phase I/II clinical trial in France since October 2011 under the leadership of Paris-based biotechnology company Lysogene.[32][33] Other potential therapies include chemical modification of deficient enzymes to allow them to penetrate the blood–brain barrier, stabilization of abnormal but active enzyme to prevent its degradation, and implantation of stem cells strongly expressing the missing enzyme. For any future treatment to be successful, it must be administered as early as possible. Currently, MPS-III is mainly diagnosed clinically, by which stage it is probably too late for any treatment to be very effective. Neonatal screening programs would provide the earliest possible diagnosis.[citation needed]\nAnother treatment currently being studied is enzyme replacement therapy, which works by replacing the enzyme that is not present or deficient by infusing the enzyme into the body.[34] However, a challenge of this treatment option is that the enzymes being replaced do not have the ability to cross the blood–brain barrier, one of the places sulfate heparan accumulates.[6] Additionally, antibodies that can break down the added enzyme are present in individuals with Sanfilippo syndrome, which can reduce the efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy.[16] In studies, injection of the enzyme sulfamidase into the brain or cerebrospinal fluid of mice has been shown to reduce symptoms of Sanfilippo syndrome. Interestingly, injecting sulfamidase in places outside the CNS has not shown to be as effective.[citation needed]\nSubstrate reduction therapy (SRT) is also currently being studied to treat Sanfilippo syndrome. Since Sanfilippo syndrome occurs due to the body's inability to break down GAGs, SRT functions by targeting the genes responsible for the synthesis of GAGs to restore the balance of production and breakdown of GAGs.[16] While this therapy is innovative, the technology to deliver the therapy to ensure effectiveness is not yet available. A part of SRT, genistein is also believed to play a role in reducing GAG synthesis in cells by blocking hormones that are responsible for enhancing GAG production.[35][16] The safety of oral genistein has been confirmed in clinical trials with children;[35] however, results on its effectiveness are inconclusive. One clinical trial showed reduction of heparan sulfate but no clinical benefit, while another trial showed behavioral improvement due to reduction in heparan sulfate and neuroinflammation.[citation needed] There is currently one clinical trial ongoing on genistein therapy.[36]\nSeveral support and research groups have been established to speed the development of new treatments for Sanfilippo syndrome.[37][38][39][40][41]",

    "Disease": "Scarlet fever",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Scarlet fever typically presents with a sudden onset of sore throat, fever, and malaise. Headache, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain may also be present.[11] Scarlet fever usually follows from a group A streptococcal infection that involves a strep throat, such as streptococcal tonsillitis or more usually streptococcal pharyngitis. Often these can present together, known as pharyngotonsillitis. The signs and symptoms are therefore those of a strep throat but these are followed by the inclusion of the characteristic widespread rash.[12] The rash usually appears one to two days later, but may appear before or up to seven days following feeling ill.[1]\nIt generally hurts to swallow.[1] However, not all cases present with a fever, the degree of tiredness may vary, the sore throat and tongue changes might be slight or absent, and in some the rash can be patchy rather than diffuse.[5][page needed] Cough, hoarseness, runny nose, diarrhea, and conjunctivitis are typically absent in scarlet fever; such symptoms indicate what is more likely a viral infection.[13]",
    "Cause": "Strep throat spreads by close contact among people, via respiratory droplets (for example, saliva or nasal discharge).[21] A person in close contact with another person infected with group A streptococcal pharyngitis has a 35% chance of becoming infected.[22] One in ten children who are infected with group A streptococcal pharyngitis will develop scarlet fever.[16]",
    "Diagnosis": "Although the presentation of scarlet fever can be clinically diagnosed, further testing may be required to distinguish it from other illnesses.[5] Also, history of a recent exposure to someone with strep throat can be useful in diagnosis.[21] There are two methods used to confirm suspicion of scarlet fever; rapid antigen detection test and throat culture.[22]\nThe rapid antigen detection test is a very specific test but not very sensitive. This means that if the result is positive (indicating that the group A strep antigen was detected and therefore confirming that the person has a group A strep pharyngitis), then it is appropriate to treat the people with scarlet fever with antibiotics. But, if the rapid antigen detection test is negative (indicating that they do not have group A strep pharyngitis), then a throat culture is required to confirm, as the first test could have yielded a false negative result.[34] In the early 21st century, the throat culture is the current \"gold standard\" for diagnosis.[22]\nSerologic testing seeks evidence of the antibodies that the body produces against the streptococcal infection, including antistreptolysin-O and antideoxyribonuclease B. It takes the body 2–3 weeks to make these antibodies, so this type of testing is not useful for diagnosing a current infection. But it is useful when assessing a person who may have one of the complications from a previous streptococcal infection.[16][22]\nThroat cultures done after antibiotic therapy can show if the infection has been removed. These throat swabs, however, are not indicated, because up to 25% of properly treated individuals can continue to carry the streptococcal infection while being asymptomatic.[24]",
    "Treatment": "Antibiotics to combat the streptococcal infection are the mainstay of treatment for scarlet fever. Prompt administration of appropriate antibiotics decreases the length of illness. Peeling of the outer layer of skin, however, will happen despite treatment.[5] One of the main goals of treatment is to prevent the child from developing one of the suppurative or nonsuppurative complications, especially acute rheumatic fever.[22] As long as antibiotics are started within nine days, it is very unlikely for the child to develop acute rheumatic fever.[21] Antibiotic therapy has not been shown to prevent the development of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.[5] Another important reason for prompt treatment with antibiotics is the ability to prevent transmission of the infection between children. An infected individual is most likely to pass on the infection to another person during the first two weeks.[24] A child is no longer contagious (able to pass the infection to another child) after 24 hours of antibiotics.[21]\nThe antibiotic of choice is Penicillin V which is taken by mouth. In countries without a liquid Penicillin V product, children unable to take tablets can be given amoxicillin which comes in a liquid form and is equally effective. Duration of treatment is 10 days.[22] Benzathine penicillin G can be given as a one time intramuscular injection as another alternative if swallowing pills is not possible.[43] If the person is allergic to the family of antibiotics which both penicillin and amoxicillin are a part of (beta-lactam antibiotics), a first generation cephalosporin is used.[34] Cephalosporin antibiotics, however, can still cause adverse reactions in people whose allergic reaction to penicillin is a Type 1 Hypersensitivity reaction. In those cases it is appropriate to choose clindamycin or erythromycin instead.[34] Tonsillectomy, although once a reasonable treatment for recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis, is not indicated, as a person can still be infected with group A streptococcus without their tonsils.[24]",

The cause of the disruption is not known; however it is likely the cause may be either a genetic mutation or a physical insult, such as an infection, an infarction, hemorrhaging, a stroke while in utero, or exposure to a toxin. Schizencephaly may also be caused by infection during pregnancy, such as Cytomegalovirus.\nIt is thought that normal neuron migration, during the second trimester of intrauterine development, is when primitive neuron precursors (germinal matrix) migrate from just beneath the ventricular ependyma to the peripheral hemispheres where they form the cortical grey matter. Often, with schizencephaly, there are additional associated heterotopias (isolated islands of neurons) which indicate a failure of migration of the neurons to their final position in the brain, possibly caused by a stroke.

Both Shh and FGF are widely expressed during early embryo development.[4][5] When this rare allele of Shh gene is expressed, the result is reduced Shh protein production, which hampers FGF expression, potentially leading to radial hypoplasia.[6]",

    "Cause": "As of 2017 the cause of the disease was not understood.[1] A 2024 review by Braud and  Lipsker aimed to \"describe what is currently known about the pathogenesis of this peculiar disease, as well as to address its diagnosis and management\" and concluded that \"physiopathology of Schnitzler syndrome remains elusive\" and \"the main question regarding the relationship between the autoinflammatory features and the monoclonal gammopathy remains to be answered\".[3]",
    "Diagnosis": "Blood tests show a high concentration of specific gamma-globulins (monoclonal gammopathy) of the IgM type. It almost always has light chains of the κ-type. A variant in which IgG is raised has been described, which appears to be one-tenth as common. The immunoglobulins may show up in the urine as Bence Jones proteins. Signs of inflammation are often present: these include an increased white blood cell count (leukocytosis) and a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. There can be anemia of chronic disease.[4] Bone abnormalities can be seen on radiological imaging (often increased density or osteosclerosis) or  biopsy.[1]\nThere are two sets of diagnostic criteria, the Lipsker criteria published in 2001 and the Strasbourg criteria that were produced at a meeting in that city in 2012.[1]\nThe Lipsker criteria require hives, the presence of monoclonal IgM, and at least 2 of the following: fever, joint pain or arthritis, bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, enlarged spleen or liver, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, high levels of white blood cells, and findings of problems in bone imaging.[1][4]\nIn the Strasbourg criteria, the person must have hives and the presence of monoclonal IgM or IgG.  Schnitzler's is diagnosed if the person has IgM and two of the following, or IgG and three of the following: recurrent fevers, abnormalities in bone imaging, with or without bone pain, findings of neutrophil infiltration in a skin biopsy, high levels of white blood cells or C-reactive protein.[1][5]\nOther conditions which can cause periodic fevers, paraproteins or chronic hives that should be ruled out, include (and are not limited to) autoimmune or autoinflammatory disorders such as adult-onset Still's disease, angioedema, hematological disorders such as lymphoma or monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), other causes of hives, cryoglobulinemia, mastocytosis, chronic neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease or Muckle–Wells syndrome.[1][6]",
    "Treatment": "As of 2017, no drug was approved to treat Schnitzlers. Drugs that inhibit interleukin 1 activity have been the preferred treatment since they emerged in 2005; since 2012 a consensus guideline has recommended treatment with anakinra.  Immunosuppressant drugs such as corticosteroids, cyclooxygenase inhibitors, interferon alpha may be effective.[1] A 2020 review reported that canakinumab was \"an effective long-term treatment with a favorable safety profile in patients with Schnitzler syndrome\".[7]\nIn June 2018 NHS England published a Clinical Commissioning Policy: Anakinra to treat periodic fevers and autoinflammatory disorders (all ages) which stated that \"Anakinra\nmay be used as a first line treatment in patients with a documented diagnosis of Schnitzler syndrome\".[8]\nBecause anakinra is so highly and rapidly effective for inducing complete remission of Schnitzler syndrome, it has been suggested that in patients who do not respond to anakinra, the diagnosis should be reconsidered.[9] Anakinra is not curative, however; symptoms recur soon after treatment stops.[10]",

    "Cause": "Schwartz–Jampel syndrome is caused by mutations in the HSPG2 gene, which makes the protein perlecan, which is found in muscle and cartilage.[3] Relationships between the disease and perlecan deficiency have been studied.[4] In Schwartz–Jampel syndrome, it is suspected that abnormal perlecan function leads to a deficiency in acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme involved in breaking down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which incites muscle contraction. If acetylcholine is not broken down, it can lead to prolonged muscle contraction/stiffening of the muscles (myotonia).[3] The condition is believed to follow an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, although some reported cases suggest an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.[5]",
    "Diagnosis": "Schwartz–Jampel syndrome is diagnosed on the basis of characteristic facial features, skeletal features and myotonia.

    "Diagnosis": "Early diagnosis of SCID is usually difficult due to the need for advanced screening techniques. Several symptoms may indicate a possibility of SCID in a child, such as a family history of infant death, chronic coughs, hyperinflated lungs, and persistent infections. A full blood lymphocyte count is often considered a reliable manner of diagnosing SCID, but higher lymphocyte counts in childhood may influence results. Clinical diagnosis based on genetic defects is also a possible diagnostic procedure that has been implemented in the UK.[12]\nSome SCID can be detected by sequencing fetal DNA if a known history of the disease exists. Otherwise, SCID is not diagnosed until about six months of age, usually indicated by recurrent infections. The delay in detection is because newborns carry their mothers' antibodies for the first few weeks of life and SCID babies look normal.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "The most common treatment for SCID is bone marrow transplantation, which has been very successful using either a matched related or unrelated donor, or a half-matched donor, who would be either parent.  The half-matched type of transplant is called haploidentical. Haploidentical bone marrow transplants require the donor marrow to be depleted of all mature T cells to avoid the occurrence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).[16] Consequently, a functional immune system takes longer to develop in a patient who receives a haploidentical bone marrow transplant compared to a patient receiving a matched transplant. The first reported case of successful transplant was a Spanish child patient who was interned in Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in 1982, in New York City.[16] David Vetter, the original \"bubble boy\", had one of the first transplantations also, but eventually died because of an unscreened virus, Epstein-Barr (tests were not available at the time), in his newly transplanted bone marrow from his sister, an unmatched bone marrow donor. Today, transplants done in the first three months of life have a high success rate.  Physicians have also had some success with in utero transplants done before the child is born and also by using cord blood which is rich in stem cells.  In utero transplants allow for the fetus to develop a functional immune system in the sterile environment of the uterus;[17] however complications such as GVHD would be difficult to detect or treat if they were to occur.[18]\nMore recently gene therapy has been attempted as an alternative to the bone marrow transplant. Transduction of the missing gene to hematopoietic stem cells using viral vectors is being tested in ADA SCID and X-linked SCID. In 1990, four-year-old Ashanthi DeSilva became the first patient to undergo successful gene therapy. Researchers collected samples of DeSilva's blood, isolated some of her white blood cells, and used a retrovirus to insert a healthy adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene into them. These cells were then injected back into her body, and began to express a normal enzyme. This, augmented by weekly injections of ADA, corrected her deficiency.  However, the concurrent treatment of ADA injections may impair the success of gene therapy, since transduced cells will have no selective advantage to proliferate if untransduced cells can survive in the presence of the injected ADA.[19]\nIn 2000, a gene therapy \"success\" resulted in SCID patients with a functional immune system. These trials were stopped when it was discovered that two of ten patients in one trial had developed leukemia resulting from the insertion of the gene-carrying retrovirus near an oncogene. In 2007, four of the ten patients have developed leukemias.[20] Work aimed at improving gene therapy is now focusing on modifying the viral vector to reduce the likelihood of oncogenesis and using zinc-finger nucleases to further target gene insertion.[21] No leukemia cases have yet been seen in trials of ADA-SCID, which does not involve the gamma c gene that may be oncogenic when expressed by a retrovirus.\nFrom the treatments of Ashanthi DeSilva in 1990, which is considered gene therapy's first success until 2014, around 60 patients were treated for either ADA-SCID or X-SCID[22] using retroviruses vectors. As previously mentioned, the occurrence of leukemia cases forced researchers to make changes to improve safety.[23] In 2019, a new method using an altered version of the HIV virus as a lentivirus vector was reported in the treatment of eight children with X-SCID,[24][25][26][6] and in 2021 the same method was used in 50 children with ADA-SCID, obtaining positive results in 48 of them.[27][28][29]\nThere are also some non-curative methods for treating SCID. Reverse isolation involves the use of laminar air flow and mechanical barriers to avoid physical contact with others in order to isolate the patient from any harmful pathogens present in the external environment.[30] Another non-curative treatment for patients with ADA-SCID is enzyme replacement therapy, in which the patient is injected with polyethyleneglycol-coupled adenosine deaminase (PEG-ADA), which metabolizes the toxic substrates of the ADA enzyme and prevents their accumulation.[19] Treatment with PEG-ADA may be used to restore T cell function in the short term, enough to clear any existing infections before proceeding with curative treatment such as a bone marrow transplant.[31]",

Patients with SCN will often exhibit recurrent, severe infections due to consistently low neutrophil counts.[25][26] Initial diagnostic steps typically include a complete blood count (CBC) to assess the actual neutrophil levels of a patient.[27] Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) chronically less than 500/mm3, usually less than 200/mm3, is the main sign of SCN.  Other elements include the severity of neutropenia, the chronology (from birth; not emerging later), and other normal findings (hemoglobin, platelets, general body health).[26]  Other elements include the severity of neutropenia, the chronology (from birth; not emerging later), and other normal findings (hemoglobin, platelets, general body health). Isolated neutropenia in infants can occur due to viral infections, autoimmune neutropenia of infancy, bone marrow suppression from a drug or toxin, hypersplenism, and passive placental transfer of maternal IgG.[24]\nA Bone marrow biopsy is also recommended to evaluate bone marrow function to remove concerns or rule out other possible hematologic disorders.[28] The bone marrow usually shows early granulocyte precursors, but myelopoietic development stops (\"arrests\") at the promyelocyte and/or myelocyte stage, so that few maturing forms are seen.[29] Genetic testing is then performed to detect mutations in genes that have been found to be commonly linked to SCN; this includes genes such as ELANE, HAX1, G6PC3, and GF1, which are critical for the proper development of neutrophils as well as the production and function of these hematopoietic cells.[30][31] Genetic testing is essential to distinguish SCN from other neutropenia disorders. Genetic analysis also provides information on inheritance patterns, as SCN can be inherited in either autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or, in very rare cases, X-linked inheritance.[28] These comprehensive diagnostic processes permit precise classification of SCN based on genetic, symptomatic, and clinical analysis, leading to treatment specific to SCN.[28]",
    "Treatment": "Regular administration of exogenous granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (filgrastim) clinically improves neutrophil counts and immune function and is the mainstay of therapy, although this may increase risk for myelofibrosis and acute myeloid leukemia in the long term.[32]\nOver 90% of SCN responds to treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (filgrastim), which has significantly improved survival.[citation needed]",

    "Cause": "Although not all causes of SGBS have been identified, one cause of SGBS type I is a mutation of the glypican-3 gene (GPC3) on the X chromosome locus q26.1. This particular gene is widely expressed, especially in tissues derived from the mesoderm during fetal development. The function of this gene is to produce a protein that acts as a cell surface receptor that binds to transcription factors. Binding of the transcription factors allows regulation of cellular responses to growth factors such as members of the hedgehog protein family. When large or small deletions and missense mutations occur along the GPC3 gene, GPC3 can no longer negatively regulate Hedgehog signaling during development, therefore increasing cell proliferation and the risk of developing cancer.[3] Limb patterning and skeletal development may also go awry when GPC3 mutations inhibit regulations of responses to bone morphogenetic proteins, another type of growth factor.[4]\nIt has been suggested that SGBS type II may be caused by duplication of the GPC4 gene, which helps to regulate cell division and growth.[5]\nAlso, some patients diagnosed with SGBS do not have any GPC3 or GPC4 deletions or mutations. Possible explanations include promoter mutation or silencing of the GPC3 gene causing reduced expression in these patients.[6]",
    "Diagnosis": "Detection usually begins with a routine doctor visit when the fundal height is being measured or during an ultrasound examination. When large for gestational age fetuses (LGA) are identified, there are two common causes: maternal diabetes or incorrect dates. However, if these two causes can be ruled out, an ultrasound is performed to detect for overgrowth and other abnormalities. At this point, it becomes essential for a clinical geneticist to assist in the correct selection of tests and possible diagnosis.[8]\nFirst signs of SGBS may be observed as early as 16 weeks of gestation. Aids to diagnosing might include the presence of macrosomia, polyhydramnios, elevated maternal serum-α-fetoprotein, cystic hygroma, hydrops fetalis, increased nuchal translucency, craniofacial abnormalities, visceromegaly, renal abnormalities, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, polydactyly, and a single umbilical artery.[5]\nIf there is a known mutation in the family, prenatal testing is available. Prenatal testing is also possible by looking for evidence of SGBS phenotype in the mother and the positive SGBS phenotype in male family members. Family members who have SGBS may undergo mutational analysis of genes GPC3, GPC4, and CXORF5. Genomic balance in Xp22 and Xq26 may also be analyzed through array comparative genomic hybridization. Evaluation by a medical geneticist is recommended for those strong indications or likelihood of SGBS and for immediate relatives of those genetically confirmed to have SGBS.[5]\nDue to the high percentage of male deaths during the neonatal period, early detection of tumors is crucial. In order to detect the presence of tumors, screening in SGBS patients should include abdominal ultrasound, urinalysis, and biochemical markers that screen for embryonic tumors.[8]\nPET scan with CT is recommended for accurate diagnostic procedure in adult SGBS patients who have manifested tumors and or cysts, especially those of the kidneys, lungs, and or patients which express atypical lesion of the liver or who may be suspect for neuroblastoma.[citation needed]\nOnce the infant is born, possibility of hypoglycemia must be assessed along with cardiac, genitalia, liver, and adrenal evaluations. Such tests include chest radiographs, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, renal sonography, and abdominal sonography and CT to test for possible abnormalities.[9]",
    "Treatment": "Since the syndrome is caused by a genetic mutation in the individual's DNA, a cure is not available. Treatment of the symptoms and management of the syndrome, however, is possible.[citation needed]\nDue to the likelihood of patients developing tumors, full body CT scans are a recommended diagnostic tool. As there have been cases in which the genetic mutation is accompanied by further genetic presence of the bard 1 gene and presence of triple negative cancers, those with such dual expressions cannot rely upon standardized biopy for determination of cancer, but should resort to further diagnostic tools (i.e. those such as pet scans which measure chemical and decay rate factors for diagnosis).[citation needed]\nDepending on the manifestation, surgery, special dietary consideration in the event of gastrointestinal affectations, special education, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and physical therapy are some methods of managing the syndrome and associated symptoms.[10]",

    "Cause": "The ultimate cause of sirenomelia is a subject of debate. The first hypothesis of its origin was developed in 1927 and proposed that a lack of blood supply to the lower limbs during their development is responsible for the defect. This \"vascular steal\" hypothesis was developed in response to the observed absence or severe underdevelopment of the aorta below the umbilical artery, which \"steals\" the blood supply from the lower limbs. Other hypotheses involve an insult to the embryo between 28 and 32 days affecting the caudal mesoderm, a teratogen exposure affecting the neural tube during neurulation, and a defect in the twinning process that either stops the process of caudal differentiation or generates a second primitive streak.[1]\nMaternal diabetes mellitus has been associated with caudal regression syndrome and sirenomelia,[5][6] although a few sources question this association.[7] Prenatal cocaine exposure has also been suggested as an association with sirenomelia.[1]",

    "Disease": "Situs inversus",
    "Signs and symptoms": "In the absence of congenital heart defects, individuals with situs inversus are homeostatically normal, and can live standard healthy lives, without any complications related to their medical condition. There is a 5–10% prevalence of congenital heart disease in individuals with situs inversus totalis, most commonly transposition of the great vessels. The incidence of congenital heart disease is 95% in situs inversus with levocardia.[citation needed]\nMany people with situs inversus totalis are unaware of their unusual anatomy until they seek medical attention for an unrelated condition, such as a rib fracture or a bout of appendicitis. The condition may also be discovered during the administration of certain medicines or during tests such as a barium meal or enema.[3] The reversal of the organs may then lead to some confusion, as many signs and symptoms will be on the atypical side. For example, if an individual with situs inversus develops appendicitis, they will present to the physician with lower left abdominal pain, since that is where their appendix lies.[note 1] Thus, in the event of a medical problem, the knowledge that the individual has situs inversus can expedite diagnosis. People with this rare condition should inform their doctors before an examination, so the doctor can redirect their search for heart sounds and other signs. Wearing a medical identification tag can help inform health care providers in the event the person is unable to communicate.[citation needed]\nSitus inversus also complicates organ transplantation operations as donor organs will more likely come from situs solitus (normal) donors. As hearts and livers are chiral, geometric problems arise placing an organ into a cavity shaped in the mirror image. For example, a person who requires a heart transplant needs all their great vessels reattached to the donor heart. However, the orientation of these vessels in a person with situs inversus is reversed, necessitating steps so that the blood vessels join properly.",
    "Cause": "Situs inversus is generally an autosomal recessive genetic condition, although it can be X-linked or found in identical \"mirror image\" twins.[4]\nAbout 25% of individuals with situs inversus have an underlying condition known as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). PCD is a dysfunction of the cilia that occurs during early embryonic development. Normally functioning cilia determine the position of the internal organs during early development, and so embryos with PCD have a 50% chance of developing situs inversus. If they do, they are said to have Kartagener syndrome, characterized by the triad of situs inversus, chronic sinusitis, and bronchiectasis. Cilia are also responsible for clearing mucus from the lung, and the dysfunction causes increased susceptibility to lung infections. Kartagener syndrome can also manifest with male infertility as functional cilia are required for proper sperm flagella function.[citation needed]\nA marked increase in cases was observed several months after the lifting of the zero-COVID-19 policy in China, which coincided with a rise in SARS-CoV-2 infections. This rare clinical evidence suggests a possible link between infection during pregnancy and the development of situs inversus in the fetus, specifically during gestational weeks 4–6, the critical period for organ positioning.[5]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis of situs inversus can be made using imaging techniques such as x-ray, ultrasound, CT scan, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).[9]\nAny potential treatment would involve a complete and highly invasive surgical rearrangement of the internal viscera of the patient. Such a procedure is unnecessary, given that situs inversus rarely causes any additional symptoms. No treatment, medical or surgical, is prescribed for situs inversus individuals, with medical professionals instead treating any other symptoms the patient may have with awareness of the unique anatomy of the patient.[citation needed]",

    "Disease": "Slipped capital femoral epiphysis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Usually, a SCFE causes groin pain, but it may cause pain in only the thigh or knee, because the pain may be referred along the distribution of the obturator nerve.[2] The pain may occur on both sides of the body (bilaterally), as up to 40 percent of cases involve slippage on both sides.[3] In cases of bilateral SCFEs, they typically occur within one year of each other.[4]  About 20 percent of all cases include a SCFE on both sides at the time of presentation.[5]\nSigns of a SCFE include a waddling gait, decreased range of motion. Often the range of motion in the hip is restricted in internal rotation, abduction, and flexion.[2] A person with a SCFE may prefer to hold their hip in flexion and external rotation.[citation needed]",
    "Cause": "In general, SCFE is caused by increased force applied across the epiphysis, or a decrease in the resistance within the physis to shearing.[4] Obesity is the by far the most significant risk factor. A study in Scotland looked at the weight of 600,000 infants, and followed them up to see who got SCFE.[1] This study identified that obese children had an almost twenty times greater risk than thin children, with a 'dose-response'- so the greater the weight of the child, the greater the risk of SCFE. In 65 percent of cases of SCFE, the person is over the 95th percentile for weight.[2] Endocrine diseases may also contribute (though are far less of a risk than obesity), such as hypothyroidism, hypopituitarism, and renal osteodystrophy.[2][7]\nSometimes no single cause accounts for SCFE, and several factors play a role in the development of a SCFE i.e. both mechanical and endocrine (hormone-related) factors. Skeletal changes may also make someone at risk of SCFE, including femoral or acetabular retroversion,[4] those these may simply be chronic skeletal manifestations of childhood obesity.",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is a combination of clinical suspicion plus radiological investigation.  Children with a SCFE experience a decrease in their range of motion, and are often unable to complete hip flexion or fully rotate the hip inward.[10]  20–50% of SCFE are missed or misdiagnosed on their first presentation to a medical facility.[citation needed]  SCFEs may be initially overlooked, because the first symptom is knee pain, referred from the hip.  The knee is investigated and found to be normal.[7]\nThe diagnosis requires x-rays of the pelvis, with anteriorposterior (AP) and frog-leg lateral views.[11]  The appearance of the head of the femur in relation to the shaft likens that of a \"melting ice cream cone\", visible with Klein's line.  The severity of the disease can be measured using the Southwick angle.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "The disease can be treated with external in-situ pinning or open reduction and pinning.  Consultation with an orthopaedic surgeon is necessary to repair this problem.  Pinning the unaffected side prophylactically is not recommended for most patients, but may be appropriate if a second SCFE is very likely.[11]\nOnce SCFE is suspected, the patient should be non-weight bearing and remain on strict bed rest. In severe cases, after enough rest the patient may require physical therapy to regain strength and movement back to the leg. A SCFE is an orthopaedic emergency, as further slippage may result in occlusion of the blood supply and avascular necrosis (risk of 25 percent).  Almost all cases require surgery, which usually involves the placement of one or two pins into the femoral head to prevent further slippage.[12]  The recommended screw placement is in the center of the epiphysis and perpendicular to the physis.[13] Chances of a slippage occurring in the other hip are 20 percent within 18 months of diagnosis of the first slippage and consequently the opposite unaffected femur may also require pinning.[citation needed]\nThe risk of reducing this fracture includes the disruption of the blood supply to the bone.  It has been shown in the past that attempts to correct the slippage by moving the head back into its correct position can cause the bone to die.  Therefore the head of the femur is usually pinned 'as is'. A small incision is made in the outer side of the upper thigh and metal pins are placed through the femoral neck and into the head of the femur. A dressing covers the wound.[citation needed]",

    "Disease": "Sotos syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The classic features of Sotos syndrome are a characteristic facial appearance, learning disability, and height and/or weight circumference greater than 2 standard deviations over the mean.[2] Characteristic facial features include a long face, broad forehead, sparse hair over the forehead and side of the head, downslanting palpebral fissures, narrow jaw, long chin, and flushing of the cheeks.[2] The facial appearance is most notable in early childhood. Affected infants and children tend to grow quickly; they are significantly taller than their siblings and peers, and have an unusually large skull and large head.[2] Adult height is usually in the normal range, although Broc Brown has the condition and was named the world's tallest teenager; as of late 2016, he was 2.34 m (7 ft 8 in) tall and still growing.[3][2]\nIndividuals with Sotos syndrome often have intellectual impairment,[4][5] and most also display behavioral impairments.[6] During early development, these individuals may have delayed motor skills, poor coordination, and problems with feeding.[2][7] Later on they may have trouble with nonverbal reasoning and quantitative reasoning. Intellectual impairment in Sotos syndrome is usually mild and does not worsen over time.[4] Behavioral impairments may include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), phobias, obsessive compulsive disorder, autism, tantrums, and impulsive behaviors (impulse control disorder). Problems with speech and language are also common.[8] Affected individuals may often have stuttering, difficulty with sound production, or a monotone voice. Additionally, weak muscle tone (hypotonia) may delay other aspects of early development, particularly motor skills such as sitting and crawling.[2]\nOther major features of Sotos syndrome include heart abnormalities, brain abnormalities, joint hypermobility, hearing loss, vision problems, vesicoureteral reflux, scoliosis, and seizures.[2] Signs of Sotos syndrome can be seen in the before birth as well with increased nuchal translucency, large head size, polyhydramnios, fetal overgrowth, renal abnormalities or cranial abnormalities.[9] Those pregnant with an affected fetus may experience maternal pre-eclampsia.[2] Some infants with this disorder experience jaundice and poor feeding at birth.  A small number of patients with Sotos syndrome (about 3%) have developed cancer, most often in childhood, but no single form of cancer has been associated with this condition. Some of the cancers reported in Sotos syndrome include wilms tumor, hepatoblastoma, neuroblastoma, sacrococcygeal teratoma, presacral ganglioma, acute lymphocytic leukemia, small cell lung cancer, and astrocytomas.[2][7] It remains uncertain whether Sotos syndrome increases the risk of specific types of cancer. If persons with this disorder have any increased cancer risk, their risk is only slightly greater than that of the general population.[10]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis of Sotos syndrome is usually made during childhood and is based on clinical examination and bone age.[13] The clinical evaluation begins with a physician conducting a thorough history and physical examination, focusing on signs of excessive growth along with other previously mentioned symptoms. Family history is particularly important to identify any affected family members and provide genetic counseling if necessary.[7] Physicians will also perform an assessment of growth velocity with growth charts and head circumference measurements.[7] Bone age is determined by obtaining an X-ray. Additional diagnostic tests may be performed to rule out other disorders. This includes a complete blood count, karyotype analysis, and measurement of IGF-1, IGFBP-3, free T4, and TSH levels.[7] There are no biochemical markers for Sotos syndrome.[14] The diagnosis is confirmed through genetic testing. Physicians will obtain a blood or saliva sample for genetic testing which looks for a mutation within the NSD1 gene.[2] If there is clinical suspicion of Sotos syndrome in a fetus, physicians may perform genetic testing on the fetus.[9]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment of Sotos syndrome is symptomatic.[14] As an infant, those with Sotos syndrome may require treatment for jaundice, vesicuoureteral reflux, and poor feeding. Children with Sotos syndrome should follow up closely with their primary care provider and any other specialists that are necessary in order to monitor for the development of complications such as seizures, infections, scoliosis, and more as discussed above.[13] Screening for tumors is not recommended as the probability of occurrence is less than 3 percent.[2] Patients should also be connected with occupational therapy, speech therapy, psychology and adaptive physical education to support their unique intellectual and physical needs.[13] Those with Sotos syndrome may additionally require special education classes, but not always.",

A review of different clinical features among SCA subtypes was recently published describing the frequency of non-cerebellar features, like parkinsonism, chorea, pyramidalism, cognitive impairment, peripheral neuropathy, seizures, among others.[4] As with other forms of ataxia, SCA frequently results in atrophy of the cerebellum,[5] loss of fine coordination of muscle movements leading to unsteady and clumsy motion, and other symptoms. Ocular deficits can be quantified using the SODA scale.[6]\nThe symptoms of an ataxia vary with the specific type and with the individual patient. Many subtypes of spinocerebellar ataxia result in cases where an individual retains full mental capacity but progressively loses physical control, but nearly half of the identified subtypes result in cognitive dysfunction, dementia, and intellectual disability.[7]",
    "Cause": "The hereditary ataxias are categorized by mode of inheritance and causative gene or chromosomal locus. The hereditary ataxias can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked manner.[citation needed]\n• Many types of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias for which specific genetic information is available are now known. Synonyms for autosomal-dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) used prior to the current understanding of the molecular genetics were Marie's ataxia, inherited olivopontocerebellar atrophy, cerebello-olivary atrophy, or the more generic term \"spinocerebellar degeneration.\" (Spinocerebellar degeneration is a rare inherited neurological disorder of the central nervous system characterized by the slow degeneration of certain areas of the brain. There are three forms of spinocerebellar degeneration: Types 1, 2, 3. Symptoms begin during adulthood.)[citation needed]\n• There are five typical autosomal-recessive disorders in which ataxia is a prominent feature: Friedreich ataxia, ataxia-telangiectasia, ataxia with vitamin E deficiency, ataxia with oculomotor apraxia (AOA), spastic ataxia. Disorder subdivisions: Friedreich's ataxia, spinocerebellar ataxia, ataxia telangiectasia, vasomotor ataxia, vestibulocerebellar, ataxiadynamia, ataxiophemia, and olivopontocerebellar atrophy.[citation needed]\n• There have been reported cases where a polyglutamine expansion may lengthen when passed down, which often can result in an earlier age-of-onset and a more severe disease phenotype for individuals who inherit the disease allele.  This falls under the category of genetic anticipation.[8][9] Several types of SCA are characterized by repeat expansion of the trinucleotide sequence CAG in DNA that encodes a polyglutamine repeat tract in protein.  The expansion of CAG repeats over successive generations appears to be due to slipped strand mispairing during DNA replication or DNA repair.[10]\n• There are numerous types of autosomal-dominant cerebellar ataxias\n• There are five typical autosomal recessive disorders in which ataxia is a prominent feature",

    "Disease": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Ataxia refers to a lack of coordinated muscle movements that include gait abnormality and is the cerebellar sign that typifies all spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types, though individuals with SCA1 also develop pyramidal and bulbar signs as the disease progresses. The average age of onset is between 30 and 40 years of age, though exceptions exist. From the first symptoms, duration is typically between one and three decades, where earlier onset correlates with faster progression.[1]\nSpinocerebellar ataxia 1, like other SCAs, often causes dysarthria, a motor disorder of speech often manifest as slurring of words; pathological nystagmus, a disorder in which eyes drift involuntarily affecting vision; and gait and balance issues. SCA1 is also commonly present with dysphagia, a swallowing disorder that can cause choking while eating and drinking; and hypermetric saccades, where the eye tends to move faster or further than intended as it tracks an object or moves from one focus to another. As the disease progresses, more severe neurologic symptoms can appear like dysmetria, where limb movements consistently overshoot the desired position; dysdiadochokinesia, where repeated body movements become uncoordinated; or hypotonia, where muscles atrophy. While new symptoms appear as SCA1 progresses,  nystagmus may disappear as eye movements and saccades slow down. Fatality may ultimately be caused by loss of bulbar functions, but complications from symptoms, such as pneumonia from swallowing problems, or trauma from falls, can be fatal as well.[1] The severity and exact phenotype of these symptoms may vary between types of SCA. SCA 1 dysarthria may vary in severity depending on the task and is often associated with more strained, strangled or harsh sounding vocalization than that of other disorders.[2]\nBecause of the significant variance between cases of SCA1, typical signs and symptoms may appear alongside more subtle or rare symptoms. Maculopathy has been reported in rare cases, and may be linked effects from the mutation on the ATXN1 locus on genes in neighboring loci.[3] Task specific dystonias have been reported in individual cases, often in the form of writer's cramps[4] or cervical dystonia.[5]\nSCAs can also be detected before serious atrophy with electrophysiologic techniques, using electrodes on the scalp to detect changes in electric potential within the brain in response to sensations or movements. Individuals with SCA1 often exhibit abnormal brainstem auditory evoked potential, including prolonged latency and absent or poorly defined waveforms, with one study reporting 73.3% of test subjects exhibiting abnormalities. The same study also found abnormalities in visual evoked potential and median somatosensory evoked potential in some SCA1 persons. These results were similar to those exhibited in other SCAs and differences between the SCAs were not statistically significant, so electrophysiologic techniques cannot replace genetic testing for specific diagnoses of SCAs.[6]\nAll SCAs cause atrophy in various neural tissues that are detectable using magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, or other imaging techniques. In SCA1 some degradation in the grey matter of the cerebellum and brain stem can sometimes be detected in presymptomatic individuals with the expansion in ATXN1.[7] Typically, grey matter loss can be observed in cerebellar vermis in all lobules of the cerebellum and in the paramedian portions of both hemispheres. White matter loss can also be observed in the middle cerebellar peduncles. The volume loss can be correlated to severity and duration.[8]\nAn estimated 77% of cases of progressive cerebellar disease are reported to have one or more mental health disorders, and 19% exhibit cognitive disorders.[9] These estimates are consistently higher than the portion with mental health disorders in the general population, but still follow other general patterns, like correlations between depression frequency and sex or age. It is unclear if depression can be linked causally to cerebellar degeneration; one study reports data consistent with depression primarily being a response to the disability, not a symptom of it,[10] while another reports evidence that depression may have a causal link; prevalence of depression varies differently between SCA types than does the rate of progression of disability.[11]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "Most SCAs and other ataxic disorders are clinically heterogeneous, meaning clinical signs and symptoms are similar between diseases and distinguishing between diseases with a neurologic exam alone is difficult.[1] In symptomatic persons, diagnosis of ataxia related disorders often requires a neurological exam, evaluation of neurological and family history, and molecular genetic testing. Absence of a family history does not exclude hereditary causes like spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 because family history may not have been collected or may be unavailable for certain individuals and new cases may originate from anticipation in an allele with a mutable number of repeats.[38]: 2–4  To establish a diagnosis, molecular genetic testing is currently commercially available for 14 SCA types, including SCA1. In cases where SCAs are not present in family history or where family history is unavailable, testing for the 4 most common SCAs will return positive results for 50% of suspected SCA cases.[38]: 11  Individuals who are at risk of inheriting SCA1 but are currently presymptomatic can also be screened with molecular genetic testing.[39]",
    "Treatment": "N/A",
    "Management": "There is currently no cure for Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1. However, some of its symptoms may be managed with physical, occupational or speech therapies, lifestyle and dietary changes, or with medications. Managing symptoms will not prevent the disease from progressing but can be important for maintaining quality of life.[12]: 48  It is important to note, however, that many disorders that cause ataxia and related symptoms exist, and that management strategies that work for some, such as vitamin E supplements for certain acquired ataxias, will not work for hereditary ataxias like SCA1 and can be dangerous to a person's health.[12]: 52\nSmall cohort studies have shown that individuals with cerebellar disorders recover coordination and have lower SARA scores regardless of stage or severity of their ataxia before therapy when they are regularly participating in physiotherapy or exergaming over individuals who are not. These studies suggest that multidomain physical therapy, more focused coordinative training, and exergaming routines all produced improvements in SARA scores equivalent to at least one year of normal progression, 2.2 points or more on average, over the course of several weeks. While these results are promising, larger scale studies may be necessary to validate these results.[55] Overall, physical therapy for individuals with ataxia has modest evidence supporting its efficaciousness, but current practice uses custom treatments without a standard decision making procedure between clinics, which limits the ability to reproducibly assess the quality of routines in literature.[56] Among the earliest developed neurorehabilitation practices is Frenkel exercises, which was developed by Heinrich Frenkel in the mid nineteenth century;[57] these exercises were drawn from contemporary physical medicine and rehabilitation techniques, called medical gymnastics, and from everyday activities, like standing up from a chair, to find exercises which are closely related to the pathology of ataxia and rely on slow practice and on the individuals perseverance to relearn key motor skills, replacing lost proprioception with visual feedback. There are exercises for lower limbs, like extending the legs, and upper limbs, like placing pegs in boards, and depending on the severity of the ataxia can be performed laying down, sitting, or standing up. All exercises often start with simple movements and become progressively more difficult to emulate real world movements affected by the disorder.[58]\nCommon recommendations for persons with dysphagia, or swallowing problems, include pureeing food, replacing difficult to eat foods in the diet, or changing posture during eating. When swallowing problems become severe enough that aspiration pneumonias are frequent or dietary changes fail to prevent weight loss, a feeding tube may be considered.[12]: 82–86  Typically these are percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy jejunal tubes (PEG-Js), however these do not necessarily lead to a decreased incidence of aspiration, as clogs may result in gastroesophageal reflux which can be aspirated. Direct PEG-Js seem to cause less frequent reflux and have lower incidence of aspiration pneumonia compared to the standard PEG-J procedure.[59] Numerous strategies for treating dysphagia have been investigated including physical exercises like modified Valsalva maneuvers, pharmaceutical treatments focused on treating spasticity, and compensatory practices including adjusting posture and longer chewing. These strategies, like the treatment of many symptoms hereditary ataxias, have small scale evidence for their usefulness but are not yet established by large studies.[60]\nAs with all hereditary diseases, concerns about the impact on family members, especially children, are often very important. Individuals diagnosed with SCA 1 may seek genetic counseling to aid in family planning, developing coping skills, and planning for the future. Persons with SCA 1 may consider in vitro fertilization with preimplantation testing to prevent passing the disease on to their children.[39]"

Infants born prematurely can be intubated for a longer amount of time due to the fact that they have more flexible cartilage and a larynx located high in the airway. 90% of acquired cases in children are due to intubation, due to the ring of cartilage in the upper airway.[2] Less commonly, infections, such as bacterial tracheitis, tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, diphtheria, and laryngeal papillomatosis can cause it. Systemic diseases, such as amyloidosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, scleroderma, relapsing polychondritis, and polyarthritis, can also cause it. Other causes may include aspiration of foreign bodies, burns, and exposure to occupational hazards.[3] Very rarely, the condition may also have no known cause, in which case it is known as idiopathic subglottic stenosis.[2]",
    "Diagnosis": "CT scans and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) can help in diagnosis. X-rays can determine the location and size of the narrowed airway portion. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) can help observe the progression of the injury. Esophageal pH monitoring can help detect any acid reflux, which can worsen the condition. A laryngoscopy or an endoscope can be inserted and used to see the vocal cords, airway, and esophagus/trachea. Spirometry is a useful way to measure respiratory function. People affected by subglottic stenosis have a FEV1 of over 10.[2]\nSubglottic stenosis is graded according to the Cotton-Myer classification system from one to four based on the severity of the blockage. Grade 1  is up to 50% obstruction, Grade 2 is 50-70% obstruction, Grade 3 is 70-99% obstruction, and Grade 4 is with no visible lumen.[5]\n• Grade 1 subglottic stenosis\n• Grade 2 subglottic stenosis\n• Grade 3 subglottic stenosis\n• Grade 4 subglottic stenosis",
    "Treatment": "The goal of treatment is to relieve any breathing difficulty and to ensure that the airway remains open in the long term. In mild cases, the disease can be treated with endoscopic balloon dilation. In severe cases, open surgery is done. Owing to the risk of complications, tracheostomy is avoided if possible.[2]",

    "Signs and symptoms": "The symptoms of SSADH deficiency fall into three primary categories: neurological, psychiatric, and ocular. The most constant features seen are developmental delay, hypotonia and intellectual disability. Nearly half of patients seen manifest ataxia, behavior problems, seizures, and hyporeflexia.[2]\nThe age of onset ranges from newborn period to 25 years. Problems unique to neonates can include prematurity, lethargy, decreased sucking, respiratory difficulty and hypoglycemia. Gastrointestinal symptoms have been seen primarily in this\npopulation and are usually related to increased feeding. [citation needed]\nOcular problems related to the disorder include strabismus, nystagmus, retinitis, disc pallor, and oculomotor apraxia.[4]\nOver half of the patients with SSADH deficiency have seizures. These include absence, tonic clonic, and convulsive status epilepticus. It is unclear whether decreased levels of GABA or elevated levels of GHB are responsible for these seizures but alterations in these neurotransmitters and their receptor binding or neurotransmitter transport is hypothesized to play a role in the pathogenesis of the seizures in this population.[5]\nSymptoms associated with SSADHD may be mild, moderate or severe and often vary greatly from case to case. [citation needed] The symptoms of SSADH are caused by the accumulation of GHB in the brain and include the following manifestations (Defined as: common, > 70% of patients; frequent 30-70% of patients;unusual, < 30% of patients):\nCommon manifestations include: [citation needed]\n• Delayed gross motor development\n• Delayed mental development\n• Delayed fine motor skill development\n• Delayed speech and language development\n• Hypotonia\nFrequent manifestations include: [citation needed]\n• Seizures\n• Hyporeflexia\n• Ataxia\n• Behavioral problems\n• Hyperkinesis\nUnusual manifestations include: [citation needed]\n• Neonatal problems\n• EEG abnormalities\n• Psychoses\n• MRI or X-ray computed tomography abnormalities\n• Oculomotor apraxia\n• Microcephaly\n• Macrocephaly\n• Hyperreflexia\n• Somnolence\n• Choreoathetosis\n• Myopathy",

    "Disease": "Superficial siderosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Superficial siderosis is characterized by many symptoms resulting from brain damage:[4]\n• Sensorineural hearing loss- This is the most common symptom associated with superficial siderosis and its absence is rare. The highest pitches are often lost first, and over a period of one to twelve years hearing loss progresses to total deafness or loss of all hearing but low pitches.\n• Ataxia- The impairment of gait, which is the second most common symptom.\n• Pyramidal signs- Various signs that indicate a condition of the pyramidal tracts.\n• Dementia- Occurs in approximately one-quarter of those affected by superficial siderosis.\n• Disturbances of the bladder\n• Anosmia- Loss of sense of smell.\n• Anisocoria- Unequal size of pupils.[3]",
    "Cause": "The most commonly described underlying cause of superficial siderosis is chronic bleeding into the subarachnoid space of the brain, which releases erythrocytes, or blood cells, into the cerebrospinal fluid. The chronic bleeding can come from many sources such as from an arteriovenous malformation or cavernous malformation, myxopapillary ependymoma of the spinal cord, from chronic subdural hematoma, from a ventricular shunt, or from chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage. Chronic bleeding sources can also be a result of past brain surgery or CNS trauma, which may be the most common cause of superficial siderosis, with superficial siderosis showing up many years later.[5] In up to as many as half of all described cases the source of bleeding was never found.[5]",
    "Diagnosis": "Early detection of superficial siderosis is usually via MRI. The iron deposition that is characteristic of superficial siderosis shows up as a hypointense band in affected tissues, with a characteristic rim of intensity appearing on the cerebellum; a hyperintense rim is rarely seen.[8] Taking samples of cerebrospinal fluid may also reveal siderosis through xanthochromia, elevated presence of red blood cells, high iron and ferritin concentrations, and elevated levels of the proteins Tau, amyloid beta (Aβ42), neurofilament light chain (NFL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), but the CSF is sometimes normal.[10] Detection is complicated by the fact that superficial siderosis is a rare disease and is not well described in neurological texts, so it may go unnoticed until noticeable symptoms appear.[11]",
    "Treatment": "There is no current cure for superficial siderosis, only treatments to help alleviate the current symptoms and to help prevent the development of further symptoms. If a source of bleeding can be identified (sources are frequently not found), then surgical correction of the bleeding source can be performed; this has proved to be effective in halting the development of further symptoms in some cases and has no effect on symptoms that have already presented.[8] \nPatients with superficial siderosis are often treated with deferiprone (brand name is Ferriprox), a lipid-soluble iron chelator, as this medication has been demonstrated to chelate iron in the central nervous system.[12]  \nDeferiprone use is associated with severe neutropenia, but this risk and associated complications are usually minimised by administering a weekly blood test that measures absolute neutrophil count.[13]\nAlleviation of the most common symptom, hearing loss, has been varyingly successful through the use of cochlear implants. Most people do not notice a large improvement after successful implantation, which is most likely due to damage to the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII) and not the cochlea itself.[14] Some people fare far better, with a return to near-normal hearing, but there is little ability to detect how well a person will respond to this treatment at this time.[15]",

    "Disease": "Superior canal dehiscence syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The superior canal dehiscence can affect both hearing and balance to different extents in different people.[citation needed]\nSymptoms of the SCDS include:\n• Autophony – person's own speech or other self-generated noises (e.g. heartbeat, eye movements, creaking joints, chewing) are heard unusually loudly in the affected ear\n• Dizziness/vertigo – chronic disequilibrium caused by the dysfunction of the superior semicircular canal\n• Tullio phenomenon – sound-induced vertigo, disequilibrium or dizziness, nystagmus and oscillopsia\n• Pulse-synchronous oscillopsia\n• Hyperacusis – the over-sensitivity to sound\n• Low-frequency conductive hearing loss\n• A feeling of fullness in the affected ear\n• Brain fog\n• Fatigue\n• Headache/migraine\n• Tinnitus – high pitched ringing in the ear",
    "Cause": "According to current research, in approximately 2.5% of the general population the bones of the head develop to only 60–70% of their normal thickness in the months following birth. This genetic predisposition may explain why the section of temporal bone separating the superior semicircular canal from the cranial cavity, normally 0.8 mm thick, shows a thickness of only 0.5 mm, making it more fragile and susceptible to damage through physical head trauma or from slow erosion. An explanation for this erosion of the bone has not yet been found.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "The presence of dehiscence can be detected by a high definition (0.6 mm or less) coronal CT scan of the temporal bone, currently the most reliable way to distinguish between superior canal dehiscence syndrome (SCDS) and other conditions of the inner ear involving similar symptoms such as Ménière's disease, perilymphatic fistula and cochlea-facial nerve dehiscence.[10][11] Other diagnostic tools include the vestibular evoked myogenic potential or VEMP test, videonystagmography (VNG), electrocochleography (ECOG) and the rotational chair test. An accurate diagnosis is of great significance as unnecessary exploratory middle ear surgery may thus be avoided. Several of the symptoms typical to SCDS (e.g. vertigo and Tullio) may also be present singly or as part of Ménière's disease, sometimes causing the one illness to be confused with the other. There are reported cases of patients being affected by both Ménière's disease and SCDS concurrently.[citation needed]\nAs SCDS is a very rare and still a relatively unknown condition, obtaining an accurate diagnosis of this distressing (and even disabling) disease may take some time as many health care professionals are not yet aware of its existence and frequently dismiss symptoms as being mental health-related.[12]",
    "Treatment": "Once diagnosed, the gap in the temporal bone can be repaired by surgical resurfacing of the affected bone or plugging of the superior semicircular canal.[13][unreliable source?][14] These techniques are performed by accessing the site of the dehiscence either via a middle fossa craniotomy or via a canal drilled through the transmastoid bone behind the affected ear. Bone cement has been the material most often used, in spite of its tendency to slippage and resorption, and a consequent high failure rate; recently, soft tissue grafts have been substituted.[15]",

    "Disease": "Superior mesenteric artery syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Signs and symptoms include early satiety, nausea, vomiting, extreme \"stabbing\" postprandial abdominal pain (due to both the duodenal compression and the compensatory reversed peristalsis), abdominal distention/distortion, burping, external hypersensitivity or tenderness of the abdominal area, reflux, and heartburn.[5] In infants, feeding difficulties and poor weight gain are also frequent symptoms.[6]\nIn some cases of SMA syndrome, severe malnutrition accompanying spontaneous wasting may occur.[7] This, in turn, increases the duodenal compression, which worsens the underlying cause, creating a cycle of worsening symptoms.[8]\nFear of eating is commonly seen among those with the chronic form of SMA syndrome. For many, symptoms are partially relieved when in the left lateral decubitus or knee-to-chest position, or in the prone (face down) position. A Hayes maneuver, which corresponds to applying pressure below the umbilicus in cephalad and dorsal direction, elevates the root of the SMA, also slightly easing the constriction. Symptoms can be aggravated when leaning to the right or taking a face up position.[7]",
    "Cause": "Retroperitoneal fat and lymphatic tissue normally serve as a cushion for the duodenum, protecting it from compression by the SMA. SMA syndrome is thus triggered by any condition involving an insubstantial cushion and narrow mesenteric angle. SMA syndrome can present in two forms: chronic/congenital or acute/induced.[citation needed]\nPatients with the chronic, congenital form of SMA syndrome predominantly have a lengthy or even lifelong history of abdominal complaints with intermittent exacerbations depending on the degree of duodenal compression. Risk factors include anatomic characteristics such as: asthenic (very thin or \"lanky\") body build, an unusually high insertion of the duodenum at the ligament of Treitz, a particularly low origin of the SMA, or intestinal malrotation around an axis formed by the SMA.[9]  Predisposition is easily aggravated by any of the following: poor motility of the digestive tract,[3] retroperitional tumors, loss of appetite, malabsorption, cachexia, exaggerated lumbar lordosis, visceroptosis, abdominal wall laxity, peritoneal adhesions, abdominal trauma,[10] rapid linear adolescent growth spurt, weight loss, starvation, catabolic states (as with cancer and burns), and history of neurological injury.[11]\nThe acute form of SMA syndrome develops rapidly after traumatic incidents that forcibly hyper-extend the SMA across the duodenum, inducing the obstruction, or sudden weight loss for any reason. Causes include prolonged supine bed rest, scoliosis surgery, left nephrectomy, ileo-anal pouch surgery.[citation needed]\nSMA syndrome is usually difficult to differentiate with anorexia nervosa.[12] Patients with SMA syndrome can be hindered restoring weight in those with anorexia nervosa.[13]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is very difficult, and usually one of exclusion. SMA syndrome is thus considered only after patients have undergone an extensive evaluation of their gastrointestinal tract including upper endoscopy, and evaluation for various malabsorptive, ulcerative and inflammatory intestinal conditions with a higher diagnostic frequency. Diagnosis may follow X-ray examination revealing duodenal dilation followed by abrupt constriction proximal to the overlying SMA, as well as a delay in transit of four to six hours through the gastroduodenal region.  Standard diagnostic exams include abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan with oral and IV contrast, upper gastrointestinal series (UGI), and, for equivocal cases, hypotonic duodenography.  In addition, vascular imaging studies such as ultrasound and contrast angiography may be used to indicate increased bloodflow velocity through the SMA or a narrowed SMA angle.[14][15]\nDespite multiple case reports, there has been controversy surrounding the diagnosis and even the existence of SMA syndrome since symptoms do not always correlate well with radiologic findings, and may not always improve following surgical correction.[16] However, the reason for the persistence of gastrointestinal symptoms even after surgical correction in some cases has been traced to the remaining prominence of reversed peristalsis in contrast to direct peristalsis.[17]\nSince females between the ages of 10 and 30 are most frequently affected, it is not uncommon for physicians to initially and incorrectly assume that emaciation is a choice of the patient instead of a consequence of SMA syndrome.  Patients in the earlier stages of SMA syndrome often remain unaware that they are ill until substantial damage to their health is done, since they may attempt to adapt to the condition by gradually decreasing their food intake or naturally gravitating toward a lighter and more digestible diet.[citation needed]\n• Upper gastrointestinal series showing extreme duodenal dilation (white arrow) abruptly preceding constriction by the SMA.\n• Ultrasound showing SMA syndrome[18]\n• Ultrasound showing SMA syndrome[18]\n• A diagram of a healthy mesenteric angle.\n• A diagram of a compressed duodenum due to a reduced mesenteric angle.",
    "Treatment": "SMA syndrome can present in acute, acquired form (e.g., abruptly emerging within an inpatient stay following scoliosis surgery) as well as chronic form (i.e., developing throughout the course of a lifetime and advancing due to environmental triggers, life changes, or other illnesses). According to a number of recent sources, at least 70% of cases can typically be treated with medical treatment, while the rest require surgical treatment.[5][11][19]\nMedical treatment is attempted first in many cases. In some cases, emergency surgery is necessary upon presentation.[11] A six-week trial of medical treatment is recommended in pediatric cases.[5] The goal of medical treatment for SMA syndrome is the resolution of underlying conditions and weight gain. Medical treatment may involve nasogastric tube placement for duodenal and gastric decompression, mobilization into the prone or left lateral decubitus position,[20] the reversal or removal of the precipitating factor with proper nutrition and replacement of fluid and electrolytes, either by surgically inserted jejunal feeding tube, nasogastric intubation, or peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC line) administering total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Pro-motility agents such as metoclopramide may also be beneficial.[21]  Symptoms may improve after restoration of weight, except when reversed peristalsis persists, or if regained fat refuses to accumulate within the mesenteric angle.[17] Most patients seem to benefit from nutritional support with hyperalimentation irrespective of disease history.[22]\nIf medical treatment fails, or is not feasible due to severe illness, surgical intervention is required. The most common operation for SMA syndrome, duodenojejunostomy, was first proposed in 1907 by Bloodgood.[7] Performed as either an  open surgery or laparoscopically, duodenojejunostomy involves the creation of an anastomosis between the duodenum and the jejunum,[23] bypassing the compression caused by the AA and the SMA.[1]  Less common surgical treatments for SMA syndrome include Roux-en-Y duodenojejunostomy, gastrojejunostomy, anterior transposition of the third portion of the duodenum, intestinal derotation, division of the ligament of Treitz (Strong's operation), and transposition of the SMA.[24] Both transposition of the SMA and lysis of the duodenal suspensory muscle have the advantage that they do not involve the creation of an intestinal anastomosis.[9]\nThe possible persistence of symptoms after surgical bypass can be traced to the remaining prominence of reversed peristalsis in contrast to direct peristalsis. However, the precipitating factor (the duodenal compression) has been bypassed or relieved. Reversed peristalsis has been shown to respond to duodenal circular drainage, a complex and invasive open surgical procedure originally implemented and performed in China.[17]\nIn some cases, SMA syndrome may occur alongside a serious, life-threatening condition such as cancer or AIDS. Even in these cases, though, treatment of the SMA syndrome can lead to a reduction in symptoms and an increased quality of life.[25][26]",

    "Signs and symptoms": "People usually complain of pain in one joint, which persists for months, or even years, does not ease with exercise, steroid injection or heat treatment, shows nothing on X-ray, but shows a definite restriction of movement.\nThere are 3 defined stages to this disease:\n• early: no loose bodies but active synovial disease;\n• transitional: active synovial disease, and loose bodies;\n• late: loose bodies but no synovial disease;\nIn the early stages of the disease it is often confused with tendinosis and/or arthritis. Once it reaches transitional the loose bodies become apparent with X-ray in greater than 70% of cases, with MRI often showing where xray fails. In experienced hands, ultrasound is also useful for the diagnosis.[2]\nRare and little known, with currently no known cure, the disease gradually forms blisters in the thin flexible membrane of the synovium, which calcify and enlarge. These nodules eventually break free and float around the joint space becoming larger – these add to the discomfort and stiffness of the joint. The affected tissue will show up as a semi-solid mass in an MRI scan, final diagnosis is usually confirmed by taking a biopsy. The disease generally affects only one of the larger weight bearing joints (hip, ankle, knee) – although the elbow, and wrist can also be affected. It rarely involves the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and most publications are case reports.[3]\nSynovial chondromatosis occurs twice as commonly in males as females and usually in their forties. However, online communities for synovial chondromatosis patients have yielded a stark contrast, with equal representation from both genders and members diagnosed as young as late teenage/early 20s. Familial synovial chondromatosis with dwarfism introduces characteristics of dwarfism.",
    "Cause": "The exact underlying cause of synovial chondromatosis is unknown. Some evidence suggests trauma may play a role in its development as it mainly presents in weight-bearing joints. Infection has also been considered as a contributing factor. The condition is not inherited.[4]\nSynovial chondromatosis can reportedly occur as either a primary or secondary form. Primary synovial chondromatosis, which is more rare, occurs spontaneously and does not appear to relate to any pre-existing conditions. Secondary synovial chondromatosis is the more common form and often occurs when there is pre-existent osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteonecrosis, osteochondritis dissecans, neuropathic osteoarthropathy (which often occurs in diabetic individuals), tuberculosis, or osteochondral fractures (torn cartilage covering the end of a bone in a joint) in the affected individual.[4]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is by medical imaging; X-ray, CT scan and MRI.[1]\nFor diagnosis of the TMJ, Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) can also be useful.[6]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment is frequently by means of removal of the loose bodies and of a partial or full synovectomy (removal of the synovium)\nFull synovectomy is a moderately major operation and involves completely exposing the joint and removing the affected tissue. Partial synovectomy is normally done arthroscopically. Synovectomies are normally carried out by shaving the lining of the knee but there are other ways of achieving this by either freezing the synovium or by the use of radiation treatment.\nThe need for further procedures is greater than 25% although normally the frequency of the required removal of loose bodies is reduced by the previous synovectomy. There have been documented cases of malignant transformation however this is rare.\nWhilst the condition can be described as a ‘benign growth’ it seldom affects more than one joint, and does not usually affect surrounding tissue.",

Patients may experience severe chronic pain, abnormal sensations and loss of sensation, particularly in the hands. Some patients experience paralysis or paresis, temporarily or permanently. A syrinx may also cause disruptions in the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems, leading to Horner syndrome, abnormal body temperature or sweating, bowel control issues, or other problems. If the syrinx is higher up in the spinal cord or affecting the brainstem, as in syringobulbia, vocal cord paralysis, ipsilateral tongue wasting, trigeminal nerve sensory loss, and other signs may be present.[6] Rarely, bladder stones can occur at the onset of weakness in the lower extremities.[7]\nClassically, syringomyelia spares the dorsal column/medial lemniscus of the spinal cord, leaving pressure, vibration, touch and proprioception intact in the upper extremities. Neuropathic arthropathy, also known as a Charcot joint, can occur, particularly in the shoulders, in patients with syringomyelia.[8] The loss of sensory fibers to the joint is theorized to lead to degeneration of the joint over time.[9]",
    "Cause": "Generally, there are two forms of syringomyelia: congenital and acquired. Syringomyelia is generally a chronic disorder that occurs over time, resulting in muscular atrophy. Acquired Syringomyelia can be caused by a serious physical trauma to the body such as in a road traffic accident. Syringomyelia can also be classified into communicating and noncommunicating forms. Communicating typically occurs due to lesions on the foramen magnum and noncommunicating occurring due to other spinal cord diseases.[10]",
    "Diagnosis": "Physicians now use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose syringomyelia. The MRI radiographer takes images of body anatomy, such as the brain and spinal cord, in vivid detail. This test will show the syrinx in the spine or any other conditions, such as the presence of a tumor. MRI is safe, painless, and informative and has greatly improved the diagnosis of syringomyelia.[18]\nThe physician may order additional tests to help confirm the diagnosis. One of these is called electromyography (EMG), which show possible lower motor neuron damage.[19] Note this test isn't used diagnostically for injuries to the spine but to nerves and muscles. This would be part of a patient's rehab routine. In addition, computed axial tomography (CT) scans of a patient's head may reveal the presence of tumors and other abnormalities such as hydrocephalus.[20]\nLike MRI and CT scans, another test, called a myelogram, uses radiographs and requires a contrast medium to be injected into the subarachnoid space. Since the introduction of MRI, this test is rarely necessary to diagnose syringomyelia.[21]\nThe possible causes are trauma, tumors, and congenital defects. It is most usually observed in the part of the spinal cord corresponding to the neck area. Symptoms are due to spinal cord damage and include pain, decreased sensation of touch, weakness, and loss of muscle tissue. The diagnosis is confirmed with a spinal CT, myelogram or MRI of the spinal cord. The cavity may be reduced by surgical decompression.[22]\nFurthermore, evidence also suggests that impact injuries to the thorax area highly correlate with the occurrence of a cervical-located syrinx.[23]",

    "Disease": "Syrinx (medicine)",
    "Signs and symptoms": "N/A",
    "Cause": "A syrinx results when a watery, protective substance known as cerebrospinal fluid, that normally flows around the spinal cord and brain, transporting nutrients and waste products, collects in a small area of the spinal cord and forms a pseudocyst.\nA number of medical conditions can cause an obstruction in the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid, redirecting it into the spinal cord itself. For reasons that are only now becoming clear, this results in syrinx formation. Cerebrospinal fluid fills the syrinx. Pressure differences along the spine cause the fluid to move within the cyst. Physicians believe that it is this continual movement of fluid that results in cyst growth and further damage to the spinal cord.\nIn the case of syringomyelia, the syrinx can expand and elongate over time, destroying the spinal cord. Since the spinal cord connects the brain to nerves in the extremities, this damage may result in pain, weakness, and stiffness in the back, shoulders, arms, or legs. Other symptoms may include headaches and a loss of the ability to feel extremes of hot or cold, especially in the hands. Each patient experiences a different combination of symptoms. These symptoms typically vary depending on the extent and, often more critically, to the location of the syrinx within the spinal cord.\nSyrinxes usually result from lesions that partially obstruct CSF flow. At least ½ of syrinxes occur in patients with congenital abnormalities of the craniocervical junction (e.g. herniation of cerebellar tissue into the spinal canal, called Chiari malformation),[1] brain (e.g. encephalocele), or spinal cord (e.g. myelomeningocele—see Congenital Neurologic Anomalies: Brain Anomalies). For unknown reasons, these congenital abnormalities often expand during the teen or young adult years. A syrinx can also develop in patients who have a spinal cord tumor, scarring due to previous spinal trauma, or no known predisposing factors. About 30% of people with a spinal cord tumor eventually develop a syrinx.\nSyringomyelia is a paramedian, usually irregular, longitudinal cavity.[citation needed] It most often affects the cervical and thoracic regions but may extend further down or up into the brainstem (syringobulbia).[2] Syringobulbia, which is rare, usually occurs as a slitlike gap within the lower brain stem and may disrupt or compress the lower cranial nerves or ascending sensory or descending motor pathways.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "A syrinx is suggested by an unexplained central cord syndrome or other characteristic neurologic deficits, particularly pain and temperature sensory deficits in a capelike distribution. MRI of the entire spinal cord and brain is done. Administration of intravenous Gadolinium during the MRI examination is useful for detecting any associated tumor.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Underlying problems (e.g. craniocervical junction abnormalities, postoperative scarring, spinal tumors) are corrected when possible. Surgical decompression of the foramen magnum and upper cervical cord is the only useful treatment, but surgery usually cannot reverse severe neurologic deterioration.[citation needed]",

    "Disease": "Systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Children with sJIA are frequently severely unwell when diagnosed. They often have lost weight and are tired, feverish, experiencing myalgia and arthralgia, as well as occasional chest and stomach pain. These characteristics may overshadow the arthritis in the early stages of the disease.[6]\nThe presence of fever at presentation is practically universal in those with sJIA.[7] The distinctive fever pattern associated with sJIA is characterized by temperatures that surge above 39 °C once or twice a day and then quickly fall to normal or below baseline.[8]\nMore than 80% of patients have a salmon-colored macular or maculopapular rash that appears along with their fever. Urticarial rash is less prevalent. The eruption is usually limited to the trunk, neck, and proximal extremities, but it might spread more widely. Macules typically measure less than 5 mm in diameter, while bigger macules may be present with center fading.[9] The degree of erythema varies in the same patient, however, it is usually migratory and nonpruritic.[10]\nThe existence of arthritis must be validated before meeting the diagnostic criteria. Although arthralgias are often present at onset, arthritis may not be visible at first and can develop weeks, months, or even years later.[9] Additionally, there is a wide range of joint involvement, from polyarticular patterns to oligoarticular patterns (four or fewer joints with arthritis). The wrists, knees, and ankles are the joints that are most frequently affected.[7] Any joint, including the temporomandibular joints,[11] cervical spine,[12] hips,[13] and tiny joints of the hands and feet, may be impacted. Myalgia and tenosynovitis are two other typical musculoskeletal symptoms.[9]\nSJIA is characterized by splenic and lymph node enlargements, which can happen separately or simultaneously. Particularly prevalent locations for prominent symmetrical lymphadenopathy are the anterior cervical, axillary, and inguinal regions. The enlarged lymph nodes are usually firm, movable, and nontender. Splenomegaly, which affects less than 10% of individuals, typically manifests within the first few years of onset and can be severe.[6]\nPericardial involvement frequently occurs. In one study, 81% of children with active systemic symptoms had abnormal echocardiographic findings, and 36% of patients had an effusion or pericardial thickening. The majority of pericardial effusions don't cause any symptoms; they can only be identified by echocardiography and don't show any overt cardiomegaly or usual ECG abnormalities. The characteristic sign of acute pericarditis is chest pain, especially when laying supine and with or without dyspnea.[6]\nThe most frequent respiratory symptom, pleural effusions, can be associated with pericarditis. They are typically asymptomatic and only discovered by chance on chest radiography.[6]",
    "Cause": "It is mainly unknown what causes sJIA. There have been reports of seasonal fluctuations in the incidence of sJIA in some places but not in others. Although it has frequently been claimed that infectious organisms cause the condition to manifest, microbiologic and virologic analyses are unable to pinpoint a single agent as the cause. Since a negative septic screen is required for the diagnosis, sJIA is not an infectious disease by definition. There is evidence that suggests a genetic predisposition plays a role in the etiology of sJIA.[16]",
    "Diagnosis": "SJIA is diagnosed clinically and corroborated by typical test findings; it is a diagnosis of exclusion.[6] Other causes of fever, such as infections, cancer, and other inflammatory/rheumatologic disorders such autoinflamatory syndromes, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Kawasaki disease, must be ruled out. When a child is suspected of having sJIA, they should always have a full evaluation for infection and cancer. This evaluation should include blood and urine cultures, imaging tests, and perhaps a bone marrow exam or lymph node biopsy to rule out leukemia or lymphoma.[14]\nAccording to the most recent International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) criteria, a child must have arthritis, ≥2 weeks of daily fever that is documented as occurring daily for ≥3 days, and any one of the following symptoms to be classified as having sJIA: organomegaly, lymphadenopathy, serositis, or non-fixed/evanescent rash[29]\nWhile there are typical patterns of laboratory abnormalities, such as elevated C-reactive protein levels, high erythrocyte sedimentation rates, neutrophilia, thrombocytosis, and microcytic anemia, there are no particular laboratory tests for sJIA.[16]",
    "Treatment": "Since the presentation and course of disease differ greatly from patient to patient, treatment must take into account the degree of involvement, the existence of systemic versus arthritic characteristics, and the presence or absence of MAS. Often, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications can be administered safely to offer analgesic and antipyretic effects without changing the results of the first diagnostic assessment.[14]\nClinical trials have shown that anti-interleukin-6 drugs, such as tocilizumab,[30] and anti-interleukin-1 medications, such as anakinra,[31] canakinumab,[32] or rilonacept,[33] are highly successful in managing the disease's systemic symptoms.[14]",

    "Disease": "Tangier disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Individuals that are homozygotes for Tangier's disease develop various cholesterol ester depositions. These are especially visible in the tonsils, as they may appear yellow/orange. The cholesterol esters may also be found in lymph nodes, bone marrow, the liver and spleen.[citation needed]\nDue to the cholesterol ester depositions the tonsils may be enlarged. Hepatosplenomegaly (enlarged liver and spleen) is common.[citation needed]\nNeuropathy and cardiovascular disease are the most devastating developments caused by Tangier's disease.[5]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "Tangier disease results in familial high-density lipoprotein deficiency. High-density lipoproteins are created when a protein in the bloodstream, Apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1), combines with cholesterol and phospholipids. The cholesterol and phospholipids used to form HDL originate from inside cells but are transported out of the cell into the blood via the ABCA1 transporter. People with Tangier disease have defective ABCA1 transporters[7] resulting in a greatly reduced ability to transport cholesterol out of their cells, which leads to an accumulation of cholesterol and phospholipids in many body tissues, which can cause them to increase in size.[8] Reduced blood levels of high-density lipoproteins is sometimes described as hypoalphalipoproteinemia.[citation needed]\nPeople affected by this condition also have slightly elevated amounts of fat in the blood (mild hypertriglyceridemia) and disturbances in nerve function (neuropathy). The tonsils are visibly affected by this disorder; they frequently appear orange or yellow and are extremely enlarged. Affected people often develop premature atherosclerosis, which is characterized by fatty deposits and scar-like tissue lining the arteries. Other signs of this condition may include an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly), an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), clouding of the cornea, and early-onset cardiovascular disease.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "There are drugs that can increase serum HDL such as niacin or gemfibrozil. While these drugs are useful for patients with hyperlipidemia, Tangier's disease patients do not benefit from these pharmaceutical interventions.[citation needed]\nTherefore, the only current treatment modality for Tangier's disease is diet modification. A low-fat diet can reduce some of the symptoms, especially those involving neuropathies.[5]",

Women are more likely to exhibit symptoms.[1] They can also appear in clusters or bilaterally along the spine, thus symptoms can be unilateral, bilateral, or with symptoms more dominant on one side. The cases of reported symptomatic Tarlov cysts ranges from 15% to 30% of the overall reported Tarlov cyst cases, depending on the source of literature. Nevertheless, these cysts are important clinical entities because of their tendency to increase in size over time, potentially causing complications and eroding the surrounding bone tissue.[23][22][24]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "N/A",
    "Treatment": "Because of the unclear pathogenesis and pathophysiology of Tarlov cysts, there is no consensus on the optimal treatment of symptomatic sacral perineural cysts. Patients often choose to pursue treatment when the progression of neurological deficits seriously impacts their quality of life.\nSince cysts are innervated, micro fenestration and surgical sleeving of the cysts to diminish the amount of accumulated cerebrospinal fluid and decrease compression of the spine and spinal nerves has been successful in a number of patients. The cysts are carefully separated enough from surrounding tissue to be wrapped with fatty tissue or pericardial biomaterial to excise the fluid from the cyst. If the cyst does not drain spontaneously, then it is drained and patched using a biosynthetic dural patch.\nThe use of this technique is done in the U.S. and is spreading in Europe but recovery is generally extensive. Micro fenestration alone has been done with some success in Asia.\nA biopolymer plate is also being used experimentally to strengthen a sacrum thinned by cystic erosion.\nThe risks of CSF leakage are higher on patients that have bilateral cysts on the same spinal level or clusters of cysts along multiple vertebrae, but immediate recognition of the leakage and repair can mitigate that risk.[citation needed]\nVarious treatment methods have been tried in the past, including the extraction of cerebrospinal fluids from the cyst, fibrin glue injection and the complete or partial removal of cyst. Epidurals can provide temporary relief but are not generally recommended as they can cause cysts to enlarge. Extraction of fluid can provide limited or no relief depending on rate the cysts refill and the need to repeat the procedure. Removal of the cyst results in irreversible damage to the intersecting spinal nerve.\nAlthough fibrin-glue therapy initially had been thought to be a promising therapy in the treatment of these cysts, there have been multiple problems associated with the fibrin glue therapy including seepage of fibrin. It is no longer [when?] recommended for use at present by the Health Department in some countries and neurosurgeons previously performing the procedures. \nNevertheless, all types of surgical treatment pose common risks, including neurological deficits, infection and inflammation, spinal headache, urinary disturbances, and leakage of cerebrospinal fluids.[citation needed]",

There may also be listlessness or muscle stiffness (hypertonia). The disease is classified into several forms, which are differentiated based on the onset age of neurological symptoms.[8][9]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "In patients with a clinical suspicion of Tay–Sachs disease, with any age of onset, the initial testing involves an enzyme assay to measure the activity of hexosaminidase in serum, fibroblasts, or leukocytes. Total hexosaminidase enzyme activity is decreased in individuals with Tay–Sachs as is the percentage of hexosaminidase A. After confirmation of decreased enzyme activity in an individual, confirmation by molecular analysis can be pursued.[28] All patients with infantile-onset Tay–Sachs disease have a \"cherry red\" macula in the retina, easily observable by a physician using an ophthalmoscope.[8][29] This red spot is a retinal area that appears red because of gangliosides in the surrounding retinal ganglion cells. The choroidal circulation is showing through \"red\" in this foveal region where all retinal ganglion cells are pushed aside to increase visual acuity. Thus, this cherry-red spot is the only normal part of the retina; it shows up in contrast to the rest of the retina. Microscopic analysis of the retinal neurons shows they are distended from excess ganglioside storage.[30] Unlike other lysosomal storage diseases (e.g., Gaucher disease, Niemann–Pick disease, and Sandhoff disease), hepatosplenomegaly (liver and spleen enlargement) is not seen in Tay–Sachs.[31]",

    "Treatment": "Patients affected by TGCT should be managed within expert centers or reference networks, by a dedicated, experienced sarcoma multidisciplinary treatment team, including a pathologist, radiologist, orthopaedic surgeon, pain specialist, surgical, radiation and medical oncologists.[24] Patients initially treated at cancer centers have lower recurrence rates than those initially treated by community centers.[23]\nSurgery has been the most common form of treatment for both localized[2]: 101 [7]: 361  and diffuse TGCT.[2]: 103 [7]: 361 [9]: 1  After surgery, patients may receive physical therapy in order to help rehabilitate affected joints.[19][11] However, recurrence of TGCT after surgery is common,[17] with a higher rate of recurrence for diffuse TGCT than for localized TGCT.[7]: 361  In cases of recurrent or resistant disease, multiple surgeries, total joint arthroplasties, or amputation may be required.[9]: 1\nA multidisciplinary approach, supplementing surgery or other treatments, can also improve outcomes in cases of recurrent TGCT.[25] In the late 2010s, treatment with CSF1R inhibitors emerged as an option[26] that may help improve functionality for patients with recurrent TGCT or TGCT that is not easily managed by surgery.[7]: 361 An oral CSF-1R inhibitor pexidartinib is approved in the US and only available through a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program,[27] and two other oral CSF-1R inhibitors, pimicotinib and vimseltinib are being developed in phase 3 trials.[28][29]\nThere is insufficient and contradictory evidence on radiation therapy, in the form of radiosynoviorthesis (yttrium injections) or external beam, before or after surgery and thus no recommendation for its use in TGCT can be made.[24]\nFor asymptomatic patients, active surveillance is the preferred method.[30][24] Active surveillance includes monitoring with MRI in intervals (e.g., every 6 months) to ensure the delay in treatment does not pose a potential harm.[24] This should be carefully weighed against the potential for over treatment.\nVimseltinib (Romvimza) was approved for medical use in the United States in February 2025.[31]",

    "Disease": "Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The signs and symptoms of TTP may at first be subtle and nonspecific. Many people experience an influenza-like or diarrheal illness before developing TTP.[7] Neurological symptoms are very common and vary greatly in severity. Frequently reported symptoms include feeling very tired, confusion, and headaches.[7] Seizures and symptoms similar to those of a stroke can also be seen.[7] Other symptoms include, but are not limited to jaundice or paleness of the skin, a fast heart rate or shortness of breath,[8] or dots on the skin known as petechiae.[9] High blood pressure has also been observed as a symptom.[10]\nAs TTP progresses, blood clots form within small blood vessels (microvasculature), and platelets (clotting cells) are consumed. As a result, bruising, and rarely bleeding can occur. The bruising often takes the form of purpura, while the most common site of bleeding, if it occurs, is from the nose or gums. Larger bruises (ecchymoses) may also develop.[11] The classic presentation of TTP, which occurs in less than 10% of people, includes five medical signs. These are:[3]\n• Fever\n• Changes in mental status\n• Thrombocytopenia\n• Reduced kidney function\n• Hemolytic anemia (microangiopathic hemolytic anemia).[7]",
    "Cause": "TTP, as with other microangiopathic hemolytic anemias (MAHAs), is caused by spontaneous aggregation of platelets and activation of coagulation in the small blood vessels. Platelets are consumed in the aggregation process and bind vWF. These platelet-vWF complexes form small blood clots which circulate in the blood vessels and cause shearing of red blood cells, resulting in their rupture and formation of schistocytes.[12] The two best understood causes of TTP are due to autoimmunity (acquired TTP), caused by autoantibodies targeting ADAMTS13,[13] or congenital TTP: an inherited deficiency of ADAMTS13 (known as the Upshaw–Schulman syndrome).[12]",
    "Diagnosis": "Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) initially presents with a range of symptoms that may include severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count usually < 30,000/mm³), microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (evidenced by schistocytes in the blood smear), and various clinical signs such as petechiae, purpura, neurologic symptoms, myocardial ischemia, mesenteric ischemia, and renal abnormalities. Notably, the complete classic pentad of TTP symptoms—microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal abnormalities, fever, and neurologic abnormalities—is only seen in about 10% of acute cases at initial presentation.[30] Clinical suspicion of TTP is often established with an initial emergent presentation of one or more classic symptoms and a complete blood count revealing severe thrombocytopenia.[31]\nThe PLASMIC score,[32] Bentley score,[33] and French TMA score[34] have been used to assess clinical probability of TTP.[35]\nA definitive diagnosis of TTP may be established when a laboratory assay of ADAMTS13 identifies under 10% of normal enzyme function. Borderline or normal ADAMTS13 activity suggests a different diagnosis is more likely.[31]\nThe ISTH guidelines suggested diagnostic and early management strategy.[36] Suggestions included 1) for high pretest probability based on PLASMIC score or French score, start TPE and corticosteroids, and collect plasma samples for ADAMTS13 testing before therapy. Consider caplacizumab if ADAMTS13 test results are expected within 72 hours.  If ADAMTS13 <10 IU/dL, continue caplacizumab and rituximab. If ADAMTS13 is ≥20 IU/dL, consider to stop caplacizumab and seek other diagnoses. If ADAMTS13 activity is borderline, use clinical judgment; 2) for low or intermediate pretest probability, still consider TPE and corticosteroids, but withhold caplacizumab until plasma ADAMTS13 test results are available; if ADAMTS13 activity is <10 IU/dL, consider adding caplacizumab and rituximab; if ADAMTS13 activity is ≥20 IU/dL, no caplacizumab should be used and other diagnoses should be sought; if ADAMTS13 activity falls borderline, consider other diagnoses.",
    "Treatment": "Due to the high mortality of untreated TTP, a presumptive diagnosis of TTP is made even when only microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia are seen, and therapy is started. Transfusion is contraindicated in thrombotic TTP, as it fuels the coagulopathy. Since the early 1990s, plasmapheresis has become the treatment of choice for TTP.[43][44] This is an exchange transfusion involving removal of the person's blood plasma through apheresis and replacement with donor plasma (fresh frozen plasma or cryosupernatant); the procedure must be repeated daily to eliminate the inhibitor and abate the symptoms. If apheresis is not available, fresh frozen plasma can be infused, but the volume that can be given safely is limited due to the danger of fluid overload.[45] Plasma infusion alone is not as beneficial as plasma exchange.[43] Corticosteroids (prednisone or prednisolone) are usually given.[44] Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody aimed at the CD20 molecule on B lymphocytes, may be used on diagnosis; this is thought to kill the B cells and thereby reduce the production of the inhibitor.[44] A stronger recommendation for rituximab exists where TTP does not respond to corticosteroids and plasmapheresis.[44]\nCaplacizumab is an adjunct option in treating TTP as it has been shown that it induces a faster disease resolution compared with those people who were on placebo.[46] However, the use of caplacizumab was associated with increase bleeding tendencies in some studied subjects.[47] Its cost-effectiveness has also been questioned.[48] Use of caplacizumab without plasmapheresis has been reported in select patients.[49] The MAYARI study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of this option.\n[50]\nThe ISTH guidelines[51] recommended for first acute episode and relapses of immune-mediated TTP (iTTP), add corticosteroids to therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) and consider adding rituximab and caplacizumab. For asymptomatic iTTP with low plasma ADAMTS13 activity, consider rituximab outside of pregnancy, but prophylactic TPE during pregnancy. For asymptomatic congenital TTP, offer prophylactic plasma infusion during pregnancy, and consider plasma infusion or a wait and watch approach outside of pregnancy.\nPeople with refractory or relapsing TTP may receive additional immunosuppressive therapy, e.g. vincristine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine A, or splenectomy.[3][45]\nChildren with Upshaw-Schulman syndrome receive prophylactic plasma every two to three weeks; this maintains adequate levels of functioning ADAMTS13. Some tolerate longer intervals between plasma infusions. Additional plasma infusions may be necessary for triggering events, such as surgery; alternatively, the platelet count may be monitored closely around these events with plasma being administered if the count drops.[52]\nMeasurements of blood levels of lactate dehydrogenase, platelets, and schistocytes are used to monitor disease progression or remission.[13][53] ADAMTS13 activity and inhibitor levels may be measured during follow-up, but in those without symptoms the use of rituximab is not recommended.[44]\nApadamtase alfa (Adzynma) was approved for medical use in the United States in November 2023.[54][55] The use of ADAMTS13 is well established for the treatment of congenital TTP.[56]",

    "Diagnosis": "Three main points in diagnosing thumb hypoplasia are: width of the first web space, instability of the involved joints and function of the thumb.[5] Thorough physical examination together with anatomic verification at operation reveals all the anomalies.[1][5] An X-ray of the hand and thumb in two directions is always mandatory.[5] When the pediatrician thinks the condition is associated with some kind of syndrome other tests will be done.[1] More subtle manifestations of types I and II may not be recognized, especially when more obvious manifestations of longitudinal radial deficiency in the opposite extremity are present. Therefore, a careful examination of both hands is important.[3]",
    "Treatment": "When it comes to treatment it is important to differentiate a thumb that needs stability, more web width and function, or a thumb that needs to be replaced by the index finger.[4] Severe thumb hypoplasia is best treated by pollicization of the index finger.[3][5] Less severe thumb hypoplasia can be reconstructed by first web space release, ligament reconstruction and muscle or tendon transfer.[3][5]\nIt has been recommended that pollicization is performed before 12 months, but a long-term study of pollicizations performed between the age of 9 months and 16 years showed no differences in function related to age at operation.[3]\nIt is important to know that every reconstruction of the thumb never gives a normal thumb, because there is always a decline of function.[4] When a child has a good index finger, wrist and fore-arm the maximum strength of the thumb will be 50% after surgery in comparison with a normal thumb.[3][4] The less developed the index finger, wrist and fore-arm is, the less strength the reconstructed thumb will have after surgery.[3][4]",

Facial dysmorphologies such as flattened noses also occur in about half of patients. Children with this disorder have small teeth, which is due to poor enamel coating, are prone to dental cavities and often require removal. The average age of death due to complications of these symptoms is 2.5 years,[2][3][4] although there have been multiple reports of patients living in to their mid- or late-twenties.[5]\nTimothy syndrome type 2 has largely the same symptoms as the classical form. Differences in the type 2 form are the lack of syndactyly, the presence of musculoskeletal problems (particularly hyperflexible joints), and often hip dysplasia. Patients with Timothy syndrome type 2 also have more facial deformities, including protruding foreheads and tongues.[6]\nChildren with Timothy syndrome tend to be born via caesarean section due to fetal distress.[2][3]",

Occasionally, the patient may present with a feeling of protrusion of one or both eyeballs (exophthalmos).[3][4]  Patients may lose their sight, and experience nausea and vomiting.[5]\nTolosa-Hunt Syndrome should not be mistaken for idiopathic inflammatory orbital pseudotumor (IIPO).[6] Both disorders have similar symptoms and respond similarly to steroid medications.\nThese may go for up to 8 weeks. Treatment can reduce the symptoms, but the disorder may recur.[5] In one clinical case in 2019, a 14-year-old boy was admitted to the hospital as he exhibited severe headaches, but MRI scans showed no brain abnormalities. Over 4 weeks, the symptoms worsened, and the patient showed paralysis in the mouth region. After being given medications to alleviate the symptoms, symptoms came back after 8 weeks and the patient had to get hospitalized.[7]\nThese also can return unpredictably, sometimes with months or years.",
    "Cause": "The cause of Tolosa–Hunt syndrome is not known. The disorder is thought to be, and often assumed to be, associated with inflammation of the areas behind the eyes (cavernous sinus and superior orbital fissure).[8] These granulomatous inflammations involve lymphocytes, plasma cells, and multinucleate giant cells. Clinical cases have shown that the disorder consists of the inflammation of multiple cranial nerves, with the highest prevalence of ocular motor nerves. In some cases, it also involves the inflammation of sensory nerves, specifically the trigeminal nerves.",
    "Diagnosis": "Symptoms come from the International Classification of Headache Disorders which was done in 2013.[7]\n• Headache on one side of the head.\n• Inflammation around the cavernous sinus - deep in the skull behind the eyes.\n• Inability to move one or both eyes due to weak cranial nerves (3rd, 4th, 6th cranial nerves) typically occurring within 2 weeks while the headaches are happening.\n• Headaches are on the same side around the brow and eye region.\n• Patient does not have another disease, such as a tumor.\nDue to the nature of the disorder, biopsy has been recommended as the best tool to assess whether a patient has the disorder or not.\nTolosa–Hunt syndrome is also diagnosed via exclusion, and as such, a vast amount of laboratory tests are required to rule out other causes of the patient's symptoms.[3] These tests include a complete blood count (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, glucose, hemoglobin A1c, electrolytes, liver function tests),[7] thyroid function tests and serum protein electrophoresis.[3] Studies of cerebrospinal fluid (cell count and differential, cultures such as bacterial, fungal, viral, glucose, oligoclonal bands, opening pressure and protein) and serologic testing (angiotensin-converting enzyme, antinuclear antibody, anti-dsDNA, antimitochondrial antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, borrelia burgdorferi serology, HIV).[7] may also be beneficial in distinguishing between Tolosa–Hunt syndrome and conditions with similar signs and symptoms.[3]\nMRI scans of the brain and orbit with and without contrast, magnetic resonance angiography or digital subtraction angiography and a CT scan of the brain and orbit with and without contrast may all be useful in detecting inflammatory changes in the cavernous sinus, superior orbital fissure and/or orbital apex.[3] Inflammatory change of the orbit on cross-sectional imaging in the absence of cranial nerve palsy is described by the more benign and general nomenclature of orbital pseudotumor.[citation needed] Sometimes a biopsy may need to be obtained to confirm the diagnosis, as it is useful in ruling out a neoplasm.[3] Other diagnoses to consider include craniopharyngioma, migraine and meningioma.[3]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment of Tolosa–Hunt syndrome includes immunosuppressives such as corticosteroids (often prednisolone) or steroid-sparing agents (such as methotrexate or azathioprine).[3]\nRadiotherapy has also been proposed[9] as an addition.[10] For patients to be given additional form of treatment, they need to perform follow up check ups.[11]\nAlthough there are known medications for patients, there is not much known about the instructions on administering the medications. Most medications given to patients with this disorder are based on other corticosteroids and other steroids, in which patients will be given a high dosage at first, and as it goes on, the dosage is decreased. Most patients will experience pain relief between 24–72 hours after the medications are given, but these times depend on the type of symptoms that the patient is experiencing.[11] Recurrences are common despite the alleviation of the symptoms. Additionally, depending on the severity of the disorder, not everyone responds the same way. Some patients may respond well to medications, while some patients may not need them at all. Doctors advise on proper diagnosis and evaluation.[12]",

    "Disease": "Townes–Brocks syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "TBS patients may have the following symptoms:[3]\n• Abnormalities of the external ears (unusually large or small, unusually shaped, sometimes with sensorineural hearing loss or deafness due to lesions or dysfunctions of part of the internal ear or its nerve tracts and centers or conductive hearing loss from the external or middle ear),  dysplastic ears, lop ear (over-folded ear helix), preauricular tags or pits (a rudimentary tag of ear tissue typically located just in front of the ear).\n• Anorectal malformations, including imperforate anus/absence of an anal opening, rectovaginal fistula, anal stenosis, unusually placed anus.\n• Kidney abnormalities, sometimes leading to impaired kidney function or kidney failure, including hypoplastic kidneys (underdeveloped), multicystic kidneys, dysplastic kidneys.\n• Heart abnormalities, including tetralogy of fallot and defects of the ventricular septum.\n• Hand and foot abnormalities, such as hypoplastic thumbs, fingerlike thumbs, syndactyly (webbed fingers/toes), fusion of the wrist bones, overlapping foot and/or toe bones.\nLearning difficulties have been reported in some children with TBS. For others, intelligence is within the normal range.\nThese abnormalities, which are present prenatally, can range from minor to severe, and as with similar disorders, most individuals with this condition have some, but not all, of these traits.",
    "Cause": "TBS is an autosomal dominant involving the a mutation of the gene SALL1, which encodes a transcriptional repressor which interacts with TRF1/PIN2 and localizes to pericentromeric heterochromatin.

In a progressive TBM case symptoms include:\n• shortness of breath\n• a cough\n• mucus build up\n• stridor (a wheeze-like sound on breathing out)\n• difficulty in breathing\n• bluish coloration to skin around the nose and mouth[3]\n• Chronic cough[4]\nSymptoms may become worse if the patient is stressed, sick, lying down, or forcing a cough.",
    "Cause": "Congenital TBM is present from birth. Acquired TBM often has no clear cause but is frequently found together with other pulmonary diseases like asthma and Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as Gastroesophageal reflux disease. TBM can be caused by damage to the support cartilage or membranous wall of the trachea, this can be the result of physical trauma (such as from prolonged Tracheal intubation) or pathological changes caused by inflammatory diseases like Relapsing polychondritis.[5] In patients with TBM in one study, the number of longitudinal elastic fibers in the pars of membranacea was reduced throughout the whole trachea.[6]\nPeople with heritable connective tissue disorders like Ehlers–Danlos syndrome seem to have at an increased risk of both congenital and acquired TBM, although the extent of that risk is unknown.[7]\nThere have been studies linking long-term use of inhaled Corticosteroids to Tracheobronchomalacia.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is conducted according to the severity of the symptoms. Initially pulmonary function tests[8] are administered. These tests include the lungs' capability of air intake and outtake, and gas flow of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the body and environment. Following these function tests a special type of Chest CT scan or a bronchoscopy will be ordered. The results of the scan and bronchoscopy[9] will display the status of the condition. A mild case of tracheobronchomalacia would be if the patient's trachea condenses 50% of its normal space when exhaling. Moderate tracheobronchomalacia would be 25% of the normal trachea space constricting and a severe case would be if the walls touch each other.[10]\nTracheobronchomalacia is thought to be underdiagnosed as mild cases may be asymptomatic and symptoms are often mistaken for more common respiratory conditions like Asthma and Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.[11]",
    "Treatment": "To properly treat a patient with tracheobronchomalacia, the subtype must be determined (primary or secondary). After the type is named, the cause must be identified, whether it is from genetics, a trauma accident, or chronic tracheal illness. If a trauma case or chronic tracheal illnesses were the cause, the first steps of treatment would be to address these underlying issues. If the cause is genetic or the previous underlying issues could not be fixed, other treatments would be assessed. More severe treatments include silicone stenting to prevent tracheal constriction, surgery to strengthen or attempt to rebuild the walls, continuous positive airway pressure[12] that has a machine blow small amounts of air into the trachea to keep it open (mainly at night), or a tracheostomy,[13] which is surgically inserted into the patient's neck that leads to the trachea to help with breathing. Another form of treatment may include a tracheobronchoplasty which is a specific surgical procedure that helps control the airway by splinting the trachea. The splint helps strengthen the trachea with the hopes that the symptoms improve.[2] People with tracheobronchomalacia who do not experience symptoms do not need treatment and are often undiagnosed.[2]\nOn 28 May 2013, it was reported that a cure had been developed via a 3D printed windpipe.[14] This cure has currently saved the lives of at least 3 infants.",

It is characterized by papules and papulovesicles with excoriations occurring on the chest, back, lower sternum, arms, and thighs.[4]  The papules are most commonly found on the mid chest.\nSometimes the features of Grover's are found in people who do not itch or have a conspicuous rash.  Most of the people with Grover's who visit a dermatologist, however, itch a lot.",

    "Treatment": "Sweating causes lesions to form, but lesions aggravated by sweat usually return to \"normal\" fairly quickly—avoiding sweat is not considered a reason to avoid exercise. Minor outbreaks can be controlled with prescription strength topical cortisone creams. More severe eruptions usually clear up after treatment for one to three months with Accutane or tetracycline. If these fail or the outbreak is severe, PUVA phototherapy treatments, antifungal medication and cortisone injections are alternatives.[10]\nSome research has suggested a correlation of Grover's disease with mercury toxicity[11] in which case Dimercaptosuccinic acid might help.[12]",

    "Signs and symptoms": "Symptoms include weakness and numbness of the limbs, deficits in sensation and motor skills, dysfunctional urethral and anal sphincter activities, and dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system that can lead to episodes of high blood pressure.[1] Symptoms typically develop for hours to a few weeks.[1][4] Sensory symptoms of TM may include a sensation of pins and needles traveling up from the feet.[1]  The degree and type of sensory loss will depend upon the extent of the involvement of the various sensory tracts, but there is often a \"sensory level\" at the spinal ganglion of the segmental spinal nerve, below which sensation of pain or light touch is impaired.  Motor weakness occurs due to the involvement of the pyramidal tracts and mainly affects the muscles that flex the legs and extend the arms.[1]\nDisturbances in sensory nerves and motor nerves and dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system at the level of the lesion or below, are noted. Therefore, the signs and symptoms depend on the area of the spine involved.[5] Back pain can occur at the level of any inflamed segment of the spinal cord.[1]\nIf the upper cervical segment of the spinal cord is involved, all four limbs may be affected and there is the risk of respiratory failure – the phrenic nerve which is formed by the cervical spinal nerves C3, C4, and C5 innervates the main muscle of respiration, the diaphragm.[6]\nLesions of the lower cervical region (C5–T1) will cause a combination of upper and lower motor neuron signs in the upper limbs, and exclusively upper motor neuron signs in the lower limbs. Cervical lesions account for about 20% of cases.[5]\nA lesion of the thoracic segment (T1–12) will produce upper motor neuron signs in the lower limbs, presenting as a spastic paraparesis. This is the most common location of the lesion, and therefore most individuals will have weakness in the lower limbs.[7]\nA lesion of the lumbar segment, the lower part of the spinal cord (L1–S5) often produces a combination of upper and lower motor neuron signs in the lower limbs. Lumbar lesions account for about 10% of cases.[5]",
    "Cause": "TM is a heterogeneous condition, that is, there are several identified causes. Sometimes the term Transverse myelitis spectrum disorder is used.[8] In 60% of patients the cause is idiopathic.[9] In rare cases, it may be associated with meningococcal meningitis[10]\nWhen it appears as a comorbid condition with neuromyelitis optica (NMO), it is considered to be caused by NMO-IgG autoimmunity, and when it appears in multiple sclerosis (MS) cases, it's misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis (MS) or seen as a type of MS. But NMO is a different condition.[11]\nOther causes of TM include infections, immune system disorders, and demyelinating diseases.[12] Viral infections known to be associated with TM include HIV, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr.[13] Flavivirus infections such as Zika virus and West Nile virus have also been associated. Viral association of  transverse myelitis could result from the infection itself or from the response to it.[12] Bacterial causes associated with TM include Mycoplasma pneumoniae,  Bartonella henselae, and the types of Borrelia that cause Lyme disease. Lyme disease gives rise to neuroborreliosis  which is seen in a small percentage (4 to 5  per cent) of acute transverse myelitis cases.[14] The diarrhea-causing bacteria Campylobacter jejuni is also a reported cause of transverse myelitis.[15]\nOther associated causes include the helminth infection schistosomiasis, spinal cord injuries, vascular disorders that impede the blood flow through vessels of the spinal cord, and paraneoplastic syndrome.[12] Another exceptionally rare cause is heroin associated transverse myelitis.[16][17]",

    "Disease": "Treacher Collins syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Symptoms in people with Treacher Collins syndrome vary. Some individuals are so mildly affected that they remain undiagnosed, while others have moderate to severe facial involvement and life-threatening airway compromise.[9] Most of the features of TCS are symmetrical and are already recognizable at birth.[3]\nThe most common symptom of Treacher Collins syndrome is underdevelopment of the lower jaw and underdevelopment of the zygomatic bone. This can be accompanied by the tongue being retracted. The small mandible can result in a poor occlusion of the teeth or in more severe cases, trouble breathing or swallowing. The respiratory system of a child with Treacher Collins syndrome is the primary concern at birth, with other issues only addressed once respiratory function has been stabilized.[10] Underdevelopment of the zygomatic bone gives the cheeks a sunken appearance.[11][12]\nThe external ear is sometimes small, rotated, malformed, or absent entirely in people with TCS. Symmetric, bilateral narrowing or absence of the external ear canal, is also described.[12][13] In most cases, the bones of the middle ear and the middle ear cavity are misshapen. Inner ear malformations are rarely described. As a result of these abnormalities, a majority of the individuals with TCS have conductive hearing loss.[12][14]\nMost affected people also experience eye problems, including coloboma (notches) in the lower eyelids, partial or complete absence of eyelashes on the lower lid, downward angled eyelids, drooping of upper and lower eyelids, and narrowing of the tear ducts. Vision loss can occur and is associated with strabismus, refractive errors, and anisometropia. It can also be caused by severely dry eyes, a consequence of lower eyelid abnormalities and frequent eye infections.[12][13][15][16]\nAlthough an abnormally shaped skull is not distinctive for Treacher Collins syndrome, brachycephaly with bitemporal narrowing is sometimes observed.[13] Cleft palate is also common.[12]\nDental anomalies are seen in 60% of affected people, including tooth agenesis (33%), discoloration (enamel opacities) (20%), malplacement of the maxillary first molars (13%), and wide spacing of the teeth. In some cases, dental anomalies in combination with mandible hypoplasia result in a malocclusion. This can lead to problems with food intake and the ability to close the mouth.[12]\nLess common features of TCS may add to an affected person's breathing problems, including sleep apnea. Choanal atresia or stenosis is a narrowing or absence of the choanae, the internal opening of the nasal passages, which may also be observed. Underdevelopment of the pharynx can also narrow the airway.[12]\nFeatures related to TCS that are seen less frequently include nasal deformities, high-arched palate, macrostomia, preauricular hair displacement, cleft palate, hypertelorism, notched upper eyelid, and congenital heart defects.[11][12][16]\nAlthough facial deformity is often associated with developmental delay and intellectual disability, more than 95% of people affected with TCS have normal intelligence.[12] The psychological and social problems associated with facial deformity can affect quality of life in individuals with TCS.",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "N/A",
    "Treatment": "The treatment of individuals with TCS may involve the intervention of professionals from multiple disciplines. The primary concerns are breathing and feeding, as a consequence of the hypoplasia of the mandibula and the obstruction of the hypopharynx by the tongue. Sometimes, they may require a tracheostomy to maintain an adequate airway,[34] and a gastrostomy to assure an adequate caloric intake while protecting the airway. Corrective surgery of the face is performed at defined ages, depending on the developmental state.[35]\nAn overview of the present guidelines:\n• If a cleft palate is present, the repair normally takes place at 9–12 months old. Before surgery,  a polysomnography with a palatal plate in place is needed. This may predict the postoperative situation and gives insight on the chance of the presence of sleep apnea (OSAS) after the operation.[11][36][37]\n• Hearing loss is treated by bone conduction amplification, speech therapy, and educational intervention to avoid language/speech problems. The bone-anchored hearing aid is an alternative for individuals with ear anomalies.[38]\n• Zygomatic and orbital reconstruction is performed when the cranio-orbitozygomatic bone is completely developed, usually at the age of 5–7 years. In children, an autologous bone graft is mostly used. In combination with this transplantation, lipofilling can be used in the periorbital area to get an optimal result of the reconstruction.[citation needed] Reconstruction of the lower eyelid coloboma includes the use of a myocutaneous flap, which is elevated and in this manner closes the eyelid defect.[39]\n• External ear reconstruction is usually done when the individual is at least eight years old. Sometimes, the external auditory canal or middle ear can also be treated.\n• The optimal age for the maxillomandibular reconstruction is controversial; as of 2004, this classification has been used:[11]\nType I (mild) and Type IIa (moderate)           13–16 years\nType IIb (moderate to severe malformation)     at skeletal maturity\nType III (severe)                              6–10 years\n• Type I (mild) and Type IIa (moderate)           13–16 years\n• Type IIb (moderate to severe malformation)     at skeletal maturity\n• Type III (severe)                              6–10 years\n• When the teeth are cutting, the teeth should be under supervision of an orthodontist to make sure no abnormalities occur. If abnormalities like dislocation or an overgrowth of teeth are seen, appropriate action can be undertaken as soon as possible.[20]\n• Orthognathic treatments usually take place after the age of 16 years; at this point, all teeth are in place and the jaw and dentition are mature. Whenever OSAS is detected, the level of obstruction is determined through endoscopy of the upper airways. Mandibular advancement can be an effective way to improve both breathing and æsthetics, while a genioplasty only restores the profile.[11]\n• If a nose reconstruction is necessary, it is usually performed after the orthognathic surgery and after the age of 18 years.[11]\n• The contour of the facial soft tissues generally requires correction at a later age, because of the facial skeletal maturity. The use of microsurgical methods, like the free flap transfer, has improved the correction of facial soft tissue contours.[40] Another technique to improve the facial soft tissue contours is lipofilling. For instance, lipofilling is used to reconstruct the eyelids.[39]",

Pruritus (itching) has been described in about a third of reported cases.[2] Facial papules are generally 1- to 3-mm in size.[5]: 415  The condition is considered to be benign, but can be disfiguring; the spines are often prominent, and in later stages the affected facial skin thickens noticeably.[2][3]",
    "Cause": "TS has been reported almost exclusively in immunocompromised patients, primarily organ transplant recipients on regimens of immunosuppressive drugs, and also in patients with hematolymphoid malignancies.[2][3] As of 2016 there were no case reports in the literature describing cases of TS in patients with HIV-AIDS.[2]\nThere is compelling evidence that trichodysplasia spinulosa is caused by a polyomavirus called trichodysplasia spinulosa polyomavirus (TSPyV) or Human polyomavirus 8.[2][3][1][6] There is evidence that exposure to the virus is common among healthy adults; estimates of seroprevalence (that is, prevalence of detectable antibodies against viral proteins) in immunocompetent adults range from 70 to 80% in different sample populations.[3][7][8] TSPyV infects the skin, but viral DNA is rarely detectable there in asymptomatic individuals even if they possess antibodies to the virus indicating exposure.[3] It is not known whether TS represents new primary infection or opportunistic reactivation of a latent infection.[3]",
    "Diagnosis": "TS can be diagnosed based on clinical observations, but is usually confirmed by histopathology of a lesional biopsy or a plucked spicule. Characteristic histological findings include enlarged and abnormally organized hair follicles and hyperproliferation of inner root sheath cells containing large eosinophilic trichohyalin granules. Antibodies against major capsid protein VP1, the major component of the viral capsid, can be used to confirm the presence of viral particles in cell nuclei. Electron microscopy can also be used to detect viral particles. Quantification of viral load can be performed using quantitative PCR, as affected skin demonstrates much higher viral loads compared to unaffected skin or to asymptomatic individuals who test positive for viral DNA.[2][3]\nDifferential diagnosis includes other visually similar conditions affecting the hair follicles, many of which appear as drug side effects.[2] A proposed classification system lists TS as one of a group of cutaneous conditions with similar manifestations and distinct etiologies, collectively called the digitate keratoses.[10] Although confirmed TS is rare, the condition is thought to be underdiagnosed.[2]",
    "Treatment": "There have been too few cases of TS reported for a standard treatment to be established.

    "Disease": "Trigeminal neuralgia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "This disorder is characterized by episodes of severe facial pain along the trigeminal nerve divisions. The trigeminal nerve is a paired cranial nerve that has three major branches - the ophthalmic nerve (V1), the maxillary nerve (V2), and the mandibular nerve (V3). Any or all branches of the nerve may be affected. Trigeminal neuralgia most commonly involves the middle branch (the maxillary nerve or V2) and lower branch (mandibular nerve or V3) of the trigeminal nerve.[10]\nAn individual attack usually lasts from a few seconds to several minutes or hours, but these can repeat for hours with very short intervals between attacks. In other instances, only four to 10 attacks are experienced daily. The episodes of intense pain may occur paroxysmally. To describe the pain sensation, people often describe a trigger area on the face so sensitive that touching or even air currents can trigger an episode, but in many people, the pain is generated spontaneously without any apparent stimulation.\nIt affects lifestyle, as it can be triggered by common activities such as eating, talking, shaving, and brushing teeth. The wind, chewing, and talking can aggravate the condition in many patients. The attacks are said, by those affected, to feel like stabbing electric shocks, burning, sharp, pressing, crushing, exploding, or shooting pain that becomes intractable.[7]\nThe pain also tends to occur in cycles with remissions lasting months or even years. Pain attacks are known to worsen in frequency or severity over time in some people. Pain may migrate to other branches over time, but in some people remains very stable.[11]\nBilateral (occurring on both sides) trigeminal neuralgia is very rare except for trigeminal neuralgia caused by multiple sclerosis (MS). This normally indicates problems with both trigeminal nerves, since one nerve serves the left side of the face and the other serves the right side. Occasional reports of bilateral trigeminal neuralgia reflect successive episodes of unilateral (only one side) pain switching the side of the face rather than pain occurring simultaneously on both sides.[12]\nRapid spreading of the pain, bilateral involvement, or simultaneous participation with other major nerve trunks (such as painful tic convulsive of nerves V and VII or occurrence of symptoms in the V and IX nerves) may suggest a systemic cause. Systemic causes could include MS or expanding cranial tumors.[13]\nThe severity of the pain makes washing the face, shaving, and performing good oral hygiene more difficult. The pain has a significant impact on activities of daily living, especially as those affected live in fear of when they are going to get their next attack of pain and how severe it will be. It can lead to severe depression and anxiety.[14]\nNot all people, though, have the symptoms described above; several variants of TN occur, one of which is atypical trigeminal neuralgia (trigeminal neuralgia, type 2 or trigeminal neuralgia with concomitant pain),[15] based on a recent classification of facial pain.[16] In these instances, a more prolonged, lower-severity background pain can be present for over 50% of the time and is described more as a burning or prickling, rather than a shock.\nTrigeminal pain can also occur after an attack of herpes zoster. Postherpetic neuralgia has the same manifestations as in other parts of the body. Herpes zoster oticus typically presents with inability to move many facial muscles, pain in the ear, taste loss on the front of the tongue, dry eyes and mouth, and a vesicular rash. Less than 1% of varicella zoster infections involve the facial nerve and result in this occurring.[17]\nTrigeminal deafferentation pain (TDP), also termed anesthesia dolorosa, or colloquially as phantom face pain, is from unintentional damage to a trigeminal nerve following attempts to fix a nerve problem surgically. TDP is usually constant with a burning sensation and numbness and is very difficult to treat, as further surgeries are usually ineffective and possibly detrimental to the person.[18]",
    "Cause": "The trigeminal nerve is a mixed cranial nerve responsible for sensory data such as tactition (pressure), thermoception (temperature), and nociception (pain) originating from the face above the jawline; it is also responsible for the motor function of the muscles of mastication (those involved in chewing but not facial expression).[19]\nSeveral theories exist to explain the possible causes of this pain syndrome. The nerve was once thought to be compressed in the opening from the inside to the outside of the skull; but leading research indicates that it is an enlarged or lengthened blood vessel – most commonly the superior cerebellar artery – compressing or throbbing against the microvasculature of the trigeminal nerve near its connection with the pons.[20] Such a compression can injure the nerve's protective myelin sheath and cause erratic and hyperactive functioning of the nerve. This can lead to pain attacks at the slightest stimulation of any area served by the nerve, as well as hindering the nerve's ability to shut off the pain signals after the stimulation ends. This type of injury may rarely be caused by an aneurysm (an outpouching of a blood vessel), by an arteriovenous malformation,[21] by a tumor; such as an arachnoid cyst or meningioma in the cerebellopontine angle;[22] or by a traumatic event, such as a car accident.[23]\nShort-term peripheral compression is often painless.[4] Persistent compression results in local demyelination with no loss of axon potential continuity. Chronic nerve entrapment results in demyelination primarily, with progressive axonal degeneration subsequently.[4] It is, \"therefore widely accepted that trigeminal neuralgia is associated with demyelination of axons in the Gasserian ganglion, the dorsal root, or both.\"[24] This compression may be related to an aberrant branch of the superior cerebellar artery that lies on the trigeminal nerve.[24] Further causes, besides an aneurysm, MS, or cerebellopontine angle tumor, include a posterior fossa tumor, any other expanding lesion, or even brainstem diseases from strokes.[24]\nTrigeminal neuralgia is found in 3–4% of people with MS, according to data from seven studies.[25][26]  This is theorized to be due to damage to the spinal trigeminal complex.[27] Trigeminal pain has a similar presentation in patients with and without MS.[28]\nPostherpetic neuralgia, which occurs after shingles, may cause similar symptoms if the trigeminal nerve is damaged, called Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2.\nWhen no structural cause is apparent, the syndrome is called idiopathic TN.",
    "Diagnosis": "Trigeminal neuralgia is diagnosed by the result of neurological and physical tests, as well as the individual's medical history.[1] Magnetic resonance angiography can be used to detect vascular compression of the trigeminal nerve and refer patients to surgery.[29]\nAs with many conditions without clear physical or laboratory diagnoses, TN is often misdiagnosed, and other conditions are also frequently misdiagnosed as TN.[30][31] A person with TN may see three or four clinicians before a firm diagnosis is made.[30]\nTemporomandibular disorder (TMD) can present similarly to TN; differentiating between these conditions can be difficult.[32] Even suspected TN patients who experience brief attacks of sharp pain have had their symptoms resolve after being treated for TMD.[33] TMD pain can also be triggered by movements of the tongue or facial muscles, so TN must be differentiated from masticatory pain by differentiating between the clinical characteristics of deep somatic pain and neuropathic pain. Masticatory pain will not be arrested by a conventional mandibular local anesthetic block.[13] One quick test a dentist might perform is a conventional inferior dental local anesthetic block. If the pain is in the treated branch, the block will not arrest masticatory pain but will alleviate TN pain.[34]",
    "Treatment": "N/A",
    "Management": "Some evidence points towards the need to quickly treat and diagnose TN. The longer a patient has TN, reversing the neural pathways associated with the pain are thought to be more difficult.[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "Trimethylaminuria",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Trimethylamine is most noticeable in urine, as it is captured, concentrated, and released in intervals. Fishy-smelling urine is a primary identifying symptom in infant children (trimethylaminuria literally meaning \"trimethylamine in urine\").[citation needed]\nTrimethylamine is also released in a person's sweat, reproductive fluids, and breath, and can give off a fishy odor when the concentration of trimethylamine is high enough to be detected. The intensity of the smell is directly correlated with the concentration of trimethylamine in the bloodstream.[citation needed]\nPeople with TMAU may have an intermittent fish-like body odor, depending on diet and the severity of their FM03 mutation. In a 2011 study by Wise and colleagues of 115 positively identified TMAU subjects,[5] after a choline challenge load test (intentionally ingesting a TMA precursor), only 10% expressed a smell at a social distance. In a fasted state (12 hours), 0% had a smell detectable at a social distance, and only 5% had some minor malodour at an intimate distance. These findings suggested that those who produced an odour had a more severe form of FMO3 impairment. [citation needed]\nSmell events are often sporadic and episodic in nature (based on diet over the previous 24 hours), making it often difficult to diagnose by smell alone. Some people with trimethylaminuria report having a strong odor all the time, but there has not been any evidence apart from self-reported symptoms that this is the case.[citation needed]\nIndividuals with this condition do not have any physical symptoms, and they typically appear healthy.[6]\nFor unknown reasons, the condition seems more common in women than in men. Scientists suspect that such female sex hormones as progesterone and estrogen aggravate the condition. According to several reports, the condition worsens around puberty. In women, symptoms may worsen just before and during menstrual periods, after taking oral contraceptives, and around menopause.[6]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "Measurement of urine for the ratio of trimethylamine to trimethylamine N-oxide is the standard screening test. A blood test is available to provide genetic analysis. The prominent enzyme responsible for TMA N-oxygenation is coded by the FMO3 gene.[citation needed]\nFalse positives can occur in the following conditions, where elevated TMA can be present in the urine without any underlying TMAU:\n• Urinary tract infection[19]\n• Bacterial vaginosis[19]\n• Cervical cancer[19]\n• Advanced liver or kidney disease[19]\nA similar foul-smelling odor of the urine has also been associated with colonization of the urinary tract with a bacterium called Aerococcus urinae, especially in children.[20][21]\nConsumption of certain Brassica vegetables, in particular brussels sprouts, due to dietary indoles reducing FMO3 activity - research found that a diet including 300g of brussels sprouts per day for 3 weeks temporarily reduced FMO3 capability from 90%+ to ~70%. No odour was reported on any of the participants.[22] This may result in minor secondary TMAU result.\nOlfactory reference syndrome is a condition where there is a persistent false belief and preoccupation with the idea of emitting an abnormal body odor. According to McNiven[23] at a Canadian genetics clinic, 83% of referrals for genetic testing for TMAU were deemed likely to instead have ORS. Findings found that the use of \"fecal/sewage\" as a description, and the use of multiple descriptors of the smell, and 'incorrect' locations of smell origin effectively differentiated ORS from TMAU. In the literature on body odour identification, emphasis is frequently placed on multiple consultations to reduce the risk of misdiagnosis, and also asking the individual to have a reliable confidant accompany them to the consultation who can confirm the reality of the reported symptom. ORS patients are unable to provide such confidants as they have no objective odor.[24][25]\nUnrelated fecal smells are an often misinterpreted self reported symptom associated with TMAU,[23] Cashman JR[26] found that 53% of TMAU and 59% of non-TMAU subjects suffered from regular halitosis, caused by dental plaque on the back of the tongue, which produced on average \"200-600 ppb of sulfurous/fecal smelling volatile sulfur compounds (i.e., VSC: hydrogen sulfide; methylmercaptan; dimethylsulfide) with each exhalation, creating a 'malodorous cloud' in their vicinity\". It is possible that other causes such as halitosis, haemorrhoids, regular bromhidrosis, ORS or in severe cases, a bowel obstruction leading to fecal vomiting may be the cause of fecal smells.[citation needed]\nThere is the possibility that someone may suffer from both Trimethylaminuria and ORS-like paranoia, due to the potential lack of ability to smell the odour oneself and the worry that it generates. It is recommended to organise reliable confidants, colleagues, friends or relatives (\"odor buddies\"[27]) to work with the sufferer to discreetly inform them if they are presenting an odour.\nAffected individuals experience shame and embarrassment, fail to maintain relationships, avoid contact with people who comment on their condition, and are obsessive about masking the odour with hygiene products and even smoking. The malodorous aspect can have serious and destructive effects on schooling, personal life, career and relationships, resulting in social isolation, low self-esteem, depression, paranoid behaviour, and suicide. Delayed diagnosis, body odour and the lack of cure may lead to psychosocial issues. When the condition is suspected or known to occur in a family, genetic testing can be helpful in identifying the specific individuals who have or carry the disorder.[28]\nThe metabolic and clinical manifestations of TMAU are generally regarded as benign, as there is no associated organ dysfunction. This designation, and the fact that the condition is often unrecognised by doctors, misdiagnosed and can have important ramifications including missed or delayed diagnosis.[28]",
    "Treatment": "There is no known permanent cure for primary trimethylaminuria, but symptoms can in most cases be managed via diet,[29] and sometimes by certain supplements (as below).[medical citation needed]\nDiet and supplement use should be overseen by medical professionals and nutritionists, as dietary restrictions can have other serious adverse health effects. Choline in particular is an essential nutrient required for proper neural formation in foetal and childhood development, if pregnant or breast-feeding a low choline diet should be avoided.[citation needed]\nWays of reducing the fishy odor may include:\n• Avoiding all seafood, including fish, shellfish, kelp, and seaweed. Sea life contains TMAO, which is used as an osmolyte to counter hydrostatic pressure underwater.[30]\n• Reducing the consumption of foods and supplements that contain carnitine,[31] such as red meat (beef, lamb and pork), liver, and offal. A study performed by Wang Z[32] found that when comparing diets where the main protein source was red meat, white meat and non-meat protein sources, consumption of red meat increased the production of TMAO, whereas white meat and non-meat protein diets generated only low to negligible amounts TMAO. This study indicates that red meat is a major driver of TMA production by altering the balance of microbiota in the stomach due to the carnitine found in red meat. A further study by Crimarco A[16] found that a 8 week plant based diet significantly reduced TMAO production, and further, that after switching the diet to include animal based protein, TMAO production was less than the participants who had only been given an animal protein based diet. The findings suggest that the microbiome in the gut is modified by a plant based diet, and for a time a person will lack the bacteria required to convert choline and carnitine into TMA at the same rate of an animal protein based diet.\n• If not pregnant or breastfeeding, reducing the consumption of foods and supplements containing choline[33] - fish, red meat, white meat, offal, egg yolks, legumes, beans, whey products, milk, and other foods that contain high levels of choline. Choline is an essential nutrient so complete elimination of choline is unadvised. As above, white meat (chicken, turkey) and plant based products may be fine to consume if red meat is predominantly avoided. Note, while raw ingredients like soybeans have a relatively high choline content, some processed products like soy sauce, soy milk and tofu have low choline content, due to dilution of ingredients, small serving size, or removal as a byproduct during the manufacturing process. It's best to check the choline content[33] of food and the portion size for a better understanding of how much choline is being consumed.\n• Vitamin B2 at 50 mg per day in combination with diet resolved smell issues for 2 children with TMAU.[34] B2 was found to increase residual FMO3 performance in the liver, meaning more TMA is neutralised.\n• Taking low doses of antibiotics such as neomycin and metronidazole[35] in order to reduce the amount of bacteria in the gut, although this is not recommended as a long term solution due to antibiotic resistance and other side effects.\n• Using slightly acidic detergent and body washes with a pH between 5.5 and 6.5\nAdditionally, at least one study[36] has suggested that daily intake of the supplements activated charcoal and copper chlorophyllin may temporarily improve the quality of life of individuals afflicted with TMAU by helping their bodies to oxidize and convert TMA to the odorless N-oxide (TMAO) metabolite. Study participants experienced subjective reduction in odor as well as objective reduction in TMA and increase in TMAO concentration measured in their urine. The study found that:[citation needed]\n• 85% of test participants experienced complete loss of detectable \"fishy\" odor\n• 10% experienced some reduction in detectable odor\n• 5% did not experience any detectable odor reduction",

    "Signs and symptoms": "The classic presentation is gelastic or laughing epilepsy, a disorder characterized by spells of involuntary laughter with interval irritability and depressed mood. The tumor can be associated with other seizure types as well as precocious puberty and behavioral disorders. Gelastic epilepsy has been more classically associated with sessile lesions and precocious puberty reported with pedunculated morphology. More recent epidemiologic studies have found these associations to be less consistent, with gelastic epilepsy predominant in the majority of patients regardless of morphology.[citation needed]\nHypothalamic hamartomas are found in 33% of patients with true precocious puberty.[2] The etiology of this relationship is unclear, but it is suspected in some cases to be due to a nonphysiological secretion of GnRH.[3][4] A case of hamartoma has also been reported to secrete CRH, causing excessive ACTH production.[5]\nSeizures often begin when patients are young, although studies have shown adult onset as well. Many causes of the epilepsy have been theorized, with EEG often finding the hamartoma itself as the source of electrical activity, or epileptogenic focus. With chronic seizures, cognitive decline can develop, which can manifest as poor school performance, decreased nervous stimulus IQ, or limited socialization. Other symptoms of this tumor type include visual disturbances, such as the appearance of motion from a stationary object, or inappropriate color perception of the entire visual field.[6]",

Surgical response is typically better when the seizure focus has been found by EEG to originate in or near the mass. The specific location of the lesion relative to the pituitary and infundibulum and the amount of hormonal disturbance at presentation can help predict risk of hypopituitarism following surgery.[8]",

    "Disease": "Tuberous sclerosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The physical manifestations of TSC are due to the formation of hamartia (malformed tissue such as the cortical tubers), hamartomas (benign growths such as facial angiofibroma and subependymal nodules), and very rarely, cancerous hamartoblastomas. The effect of these on the brain leads to neurological symptoms such as seizures, intellectual disability, developmental delay, and behavioral problems.[citation needed]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "Tuberous sclerosis complex is diagnosed with clinical and genetic tests. There are many different mutations in the TSC1 and TSC2 genes that have been identified in individuals with TSC. A pathogenic mutation in the gene prevents the proteins from being made or inactivates the proteins. If such a pathogenic mutation is found then this alone is sufficient to diagnose TSC. However, some mutations are less clear in their effect, and so not sufficient alone for diagnosis. Between 1 in 10 and 1 in 4 of individuals with TSC have no mutation that can be identified. Once a particular mutation is identified in someone with TSC, this mutation can be used to make confident diagnoses in other family members.[11]\nFor clinical diagnosis, there isn't one sign that is unique (pathognomonic) to TSC, nor are all signs seen in all individuals. Therefore, several signs are considered together, classed as either major or minor features. An individual with two major features, or one major feature and at least two minor features can be given a definite diagnosis of TSC. If only one major feature or at least two minor features are present, the diagnosis is only regarded as possibly TSC.[11]\nTSC can be first diagnosed at any stage of life. Prenatal diagnosis is possible by chance if heart tumours are discovered during routine ultrasound. In infancy, epilepsy, particularly infantile spasms, or developmental delay may lead to neurological tests. The white patches on the skin may also first become noticed. In childhood, behavioural problems and autism spectrum disorder may provoke a diagnosis. During adolescence, the skin problems appear. In adulthood, kidney and lung problems may develop. An individual may also be diagnosed at any time as a result of genetic testing of family members of another affected person.[24]",
    "Treatment": "N/A",
    "Management": "Tuberous sclerosis complex affects multiple organ systems so a multidisciplinary team of medical professionals is required.[citation needed]\nIn suspected or newly diagnosed TSC, the following tests and procedures are recommended by 2012 International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus Conference.[25]\n• Take a personal and family history covering three generations. Genetic counselling and tests determine if other individuals are at risk.\n• A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to identify tubers, subependymal nodules (SEN) and sub-ependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGA).\n• Children undergo a baseline electroencephalograph (EEG) and family educated to identify seizures if/when they occur.\n• Assess children for behavioural issues, autism spectrum disorder, psychiatric disorders, developmental delay, and neuropsychological problems.\n• Scan the abdomen for tumours in various organs, but most importantly angiomyolipomata in the kidneys. MRI is superior to CT or ultrasound. Take blood pressure and test renal function.\n• In adult women, test pulmonary function and perform a high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest.\n• Examine the skin under a Wood's lamp (hypomelanotic macules), the fingers and toes (ungual fibroma), the face (angiofibromas), and the mouth (dental pits and gingival fibromas).\n• In infants under three, perform an echocardiogram to spot rhabdomyomas, and electrocardiogram (ECG) for any arrhythmia.\n• Use a fundoscope to spot retinal hamartomas or achromic patches.\nThe various symptoms and complications from TSC may appear throughout life, requiring continued surveillance and adjustment to treatments. The following ongoing tests and procedures are recommended by 2012 International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus Conference.[25]\n• In children and adults younger than 25 years, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is performed every one to three years to monitor for subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA). If a SEGA is large, growing or interfering with ventricles, the MRI is performed more frequently. After 25 years, if there are no SEGAs then periodic scans may no longer be required. A SEGA causing acute symptoms are removed with surgery, otherwise either surgery or drug treatment with an mTOR inhibitor may be indicated.\n• Repeat screening for TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (TAND) at least annually. Sudden behavioural changes may indicate a new physical problem (for example with the kidneys, epilepsy or a SEGA).\n• Routine EEG determined by clinical need.\n• Infantile spasms are best treated with vigabatrin and adrenocorticotropic hormone used as a second-line therapy. Other seizure types have no TSC-specific recommendation, though epilepsy in TSC is typically difficult to treat (medically refractory).\n• Repeat MRI of abdomen every one to three years throughout life. Check renal (kidney) function annually. Should angiomyolipoma bleed, this is best treated with embolisation and then corticosteroids. Removal of the kidney (nephrectomy) is strongly to be avoided. An asymptomatic angiomyolipoma that is growing larger than 3 cm is best treated with an mTOR inhibitor drug. Other renal complications spotted by imaging include polycystic kidney disease and renal cell carcinoma.\n• Repeat chest HRCT in adult women every five to 10 years. Evidence of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) indicates more frequent testing. An mTOR inhibitor drug can help, though a lung transplant may be required.\n• A 12-lead ECG should be performed every three to five years.\nThe mTOR inhibitor everolimus was approved in the US for treatment of TSC-related tumors in the brain (subependymal giant cell astrocytoma) in 2010 and in the kidneys (renal angiomyolipoma) in 2012.[26][27]  Oral everolimus (rapalog) reduces tumour size, is effective in terms of response to skin lesions and does not increase the risk of adverse events.[28] Everolimus also showed evidence of effectiveness at treating epilepsy in some people with TSC.[29][30] In 2017, the European Commission approved everolimus for treatment of refractory partial-onset seizures associated with TSC.[31]\nNeurosurgical intervention may reduce the severity and frequency of seizures in TSC patients.[32][33] Embolization and other surgical interventions can be used to treat renal angiomyolipoma with acute hemorrhage. Surgical treatments for symptoms of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) in adult TSC patients include pleurodesis to prevent pneumothorax and lung transplantation in the case of irreversible lung failure.[25]\nOther treatments that have been used to treat TSC manifestations and symptoms include a ketogenic diet for intractable epilepsy and pulmonary rehabilitation for LAM.[34] Facial angiofibromas can be reduced with laser treatment and the effectiveness of mTOR inhibitor topical treatment is being investigated. Laser therapy is painful, requires anaesthesia, and has risks of scarring and dyspigmentation.[35]"

    "Disease": "Tyrosinemia type I",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Type 1 tyrosinemia typically presents in infancy as failure to thrive and hepatomegaly.  The primary effects are progressive liver and kidney dysfunction.  The liver disease causes cirrhosis, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, elevated AFP, hypoglycemia and coagulation abnormalities.  This can lead to jaundice, ascites and hemorrhage.  There is also an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.[citation needed]The kidney dysfunction presents as Fanconi syndrome: Renal tubular acidosis, hypophosphatemia and aminoaciduria.  Cardiomyopathy, neurologic and dermatologic manifestations are also possible. The urine has an odor of cabbage or rancid butter.[4]\nThe presentation of symptoms of tyrosinemia type 1 in terms of timing is broken into three categories: acute, sub-acute, and chronic.[citation needed]\nThe acute classification typically is presented clinically between birth and 6 months of age. The common presentation in an acute case is synthetic liver failure, marked by the lack of formation of coagulation factors in blood. Patients are prone to infections at this stage accompanied by fever, vomiting, increased tendency to bleed, and diarrhea along with bloody feces as manifestations of sepsis. Other symptoms include enlarged liver, jaundice, and excess abdominal fluid.[1][2]\nSub-acute cases present between 6 months and the first year of life and the severity of liver disease is lessened to an extent. Again, synthetic function of the liver in terms of blood coagulation factors is impaired in addition to enlargement of the liver and spleen. The infant may also display a failure to thrive as their growth is limited by the disease. This growth impairment can manifest itself in rickets, which is the softening of bones.[1][2]\nThe final classification, chronic HT1, is detected with presentations occurring after one year of life. The course of the disease up to this point can lead to different ailments affecting the liver. Cirrhosis, liver failure, or cancer of the liver may present as a result of chronic liver disease. Additional symptoms common in this classification include cardiomyopathy, renal disease, and acute neurological crises.[1][2]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "Beyond the identification of physical clinical symptoms outlined above, the definitive criterion for diagnostic assessment of Tyrosinemia Type I is elevated succinylacetone (SA) in blood and urine. Elevated SA levels are not associated with any other known medical condition, so there is minimal risk of misdiagnosis.[5] Quantitation of tyrosine levels is also used as a diagnostic but is less reliable due to high false positive and false negative rates.[9] Newborns are not generally screened for HT1 due to rarity of the condition and lack of apparent symptoms at time of birth.[1] However, prompt assessment upon the manifestation of physical symptoms such as fever, vomiting, increased tendency to bleed, diarrhea along with bloody feces, and jaundice is critical for improving long term prognosis.[1][2]",
    "Treatment": "N/A",
    "Management": "The primary treatment for type 1 tyrosinemia is nitisinone and restriction of tyrosine in the diet.[6] Nitisinone inhibits the conversion of 4-OH phenylpyruvate to homogentisic acid by 4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, the second step in tyrosine degradation.  By inhibiting this enzyme, the accumulation of the fumarylacetoacetate is prevented.[10] Previously, liver transplantation was the primary treatment option and is still used in patients in whom nitisinone fails.[citation needed]\nClinical treatment of HT1 relies on medications and strict regulation of diet. Nitisinone and dietary restrictions that decrease the amount of tyrosine and phenylalaine absorbed from the GI tract during protein digestion are used in combination as therapeutic measures that control the disease state if they are continued indefinitely. If not, there is a lack of control over the disease, resulting in continued liver and kidney damage, contributing to organ failure and death. In this case, a liver transplant may be required.[2] Levels of SA are monitored throughout treatment in order to assess treatment effectiveness.[9]"

    "Cause": "Although the precise cause of Uhl's anomaly is unknown, there have been reports of primary nondevelopment of myocytes, selective apoptosis, and cardiomyocyte overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor.[7][8] A sporadic mutation could indicate that genetics is the underlying cause.[9]",
    "Diagnosis": "Myocardial biopsies can confirm the diagnosis, which is often established by imaging tests like cardiac magnetic resonance imaging or echocardiogram.[10]\nRight atrial and right ventricular dilatation is the cause of the cardiomegaly seen on the chest radiograph. The lung fields of newborns with functional pulmonary atresia and high pulmonary vascular resistance appear oligaemic.[6]\nRight ventricular and right atrial dilatation is evident on the electrocardiogram. One can observe an epsilon (ε) wave in the right praecordial leads.[6]\nAn echocardiographic evaluation reveals a thin free wall of the right ventricle without any myocardium, reduced contractility and restricted ventricle filling, dilation of the right atrium, and normal tricuspid valve attachment to the right atrioventricular junction.[6]\nGlobal dyskinesia of a thin-walled right ventricle, absence of myocardium at the right ventricular free wall, lack of fibrofatty infiltration, normal tricuspid valve attachment to the right atrioventricular junction, and normal left ventricular myocardium are all indicative of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging findings.[6]\nHistopathologically, nonfunctioning fibroelastic tissue replaces the myocardial layer, giving the right ventricular free wall a parchment-like appearance.[11]\nOther anomalies that can result in RV dilatation, such as Ebstein anomaly, RV arrhythmogenic dysplasia, pulmonary atresia, and anomalous pulmonary venous return, are included in the differential diagnosis of Uhl anomaly.[12]",
    "Treatment": "When the pulmonary vascular resistance has become high and the newborn has severe cyanosis soon after birth, a brief intravenous prostaglandin E infusion is recommended.

    "Signs and symptoms": "Patients with Unverricht–Lundborg disease exhibit myoclonic jerks and tonic-clonic seizures at a young age, between ages 6–16. The myoclonic jerks occur in the muscles of the arms and legs closest to the torso, and are triggered due to a variety of common external stimuli.[7] Seizures begin at an average age of 10.8 years, with myoclonus beginning around 12.1 years.[8] It is not currently possible to diagnose without a genetic test, and since early symptoms are general, it is often mistaken for another more common epilepsy, in many cases juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME).[7] These episodes of myoclonus may be caused by physical exertion, stress, light, or other stimuli. Within 5-10 years, these episodes may increase in severity to the point that they interfere with everyday activities such as walking. Individuals with Unverricht-Lundborg disease also often experience seizures involving muscle rigidity, convulsions, and loss of consciousness; these may also increase in frequency as the disease progresses but may be controlled with treatment. After several years, these seizures may stabilize or decrease in frequency. Eventually, people with Unverricht-Lundborg disease may develop ataxia, intention tremor, dysarthria, depression, and a slow, mild decline in intellectual functioning.[9]",
    "Cause": "The genetic cause of ULD is known, but research has led to new areas of study that may lead to an increase in knowledge of what causes ULD.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "The only currently available method to diagnose Unverricht–Lundborg disease is a genetic test to check for the presence of the mutated cystatin B gene. If this gene is present in an individual suspected of having the disease, it can be confirmed. However, genetic tests of this type are prohibitively expensive to perform, especially due to the rarity of ULD.[13] The early symptoms of ULD are general and in many cases similar to other more common epilepsies, such as juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.[7] For these reasons, ULD is generally one of the last options doctors explore when looking to diagnose patients exhibiting its symptoms. In most cases, a misdiagnosis is not detrimental to the patient, because many of the same medications are used to treat both ULD and whatever type of epilepsy the patient has been misdiagnosed with. However, there are a few epilepsy medications that increase the incidence of seizures and myoclonic jerks in patients with ULD, which can lead to an increase in the speed of progression, including phenytoin, fosphenytoin, sodium channel blockers, GABAergic drugs, gabapentin and pregabalin.[7]\nOther methods to diagnose Unverricht–Lundborg disease are currently being explored. While electroencephalogram (EEG) is useful in identifying or diagnosing other forms of epilepsy, the location of seizures in ULD is currently known to be generalized across the entire brain. Without a specific region to pinpoint, it is difficult to accurately distinguish an EEG reading from an individual with ULD from an individual with another type of epilepsy characterized by generalized brain seizures. However, with recent research linking ULD brain damage to the hippocampus,[12] the usefulness of EEG as a diagnostic tool may increase.\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is also often used during diagnosis of patients with epilepsy. While MRIs taken during the onset of the disease are generally similar to those of individuals without ULD, MRIs taken once the disease has progressed show characteristic damage[7]\nWhile ULD is a rare disease, the lack of well defined cases to study and the difficulty in confirming diagnosis provide strong evidence that this disease is likely under diagnosed.[2]",
    "Treatment": "While there is no current cure to repair the mutated CSTB gene, several antiepileptic drugs are effective in reducing seizures and helping patients with ULD to manage the symptoms. In addition, new research is being performed to examine the effectiveness of other types of treatments.[citation needed]",

    "Disease": "Upshaw–Schulman syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The presentation of TTP is variable. The initial symptoms, which force the patient to medical care, are often the consequence of lower platelet counts like purpura (present in 90% of patients), ecchymosis and hematoma.[4] Patients may also report signs and symptoms as a result of (microangiopathic) hemolytic anemia, such as (dark) beer-brown urine, (mild) jaundice, fatigue and pallor. Cerebral symptoms of various degree are present in many patients, including headache, paresis, speech disorder, visual problems, seizures and disturbance of consciousness up to coma. The symptoms can fluctuate so that they may only be temporarily present but may reappear again later in the TTP episode. Other unspecific symptoms are general malaise, abdominal, joint and muscle pain. Severe manifestations of heart or lung involvements are rare, although affections are not seldom measurable (such as ECG changes).[5]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "A diagnosis of TTP is based on the clinical symptoms with the concomitant presence of thrombocytopenia (platelet count below 100×109/L) and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with schistocytes on the blood smear, a negative direct antiglobulin test (Coombs test), elevated levels of hemolysis markers (such as total bilirubin, LDH, free hemoglobin, and an unmeasurable haptoglobin), after exclusion of any other apparent cause.[1][2]\nUSS can present similar to the following diseases, which have to be excluded: fulminant infections, disseminated intravascular coagulation, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, Evans syndrome, the typical and atypical form of hemolytic uremic syndrome, HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome, pre-eclampsia, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, cancer that is often accompanied with metastasis, kidney injury, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and side effects from hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.[1][2]\nOf note is that pregnancy associated affections like pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, and HELLP syndrome can overlap in their presentation as pregnancy can trigger TTP episodes.[19]\nPatients with fulminant infections, disseminated intravascular coagulation, HELLP syndrome, pancreatitis, liver disease, and other active inflammatory conditions may have reduced ADAMTS13 activity, but almost never a relevant severe ADAMTS13 deficiency <10% of the normal.[2][20]\nA severe ADAMTS13 deficiency below 5% or <10% of the normal (depending on the definitions)[1][21] is highly specific for the diagnosis of TTP.[16][22] ADAMTS13 activity assays are based on the direct or indirect measurement of vWF-cleavage products. Its activity should be measured in blood samples taken before therapy has started, to prevent false high ADAMTS13 activity.[2] If a severe ADAMTS13 deficiency is present an ADAMTS13 inhibitor assay is needed to distinguish between the acquired, autoantibody-mediated and the congenital form of TTP (USS).[1] The presence of antibodies can be tested by ELISA or functional inhibitor assays. The level of ADAMTS13 inhibitor may be fluctuating over the course of disease and depends on free circulatory antibodies, therefore a onetime negative test result does not always exclude the presence of ADAMTS13 inhibitors and thereby an autoimmune origin of TTP.[2] A severe ADAMTS13 deficiency in the absence of an inhibitor, confirmed on a second time point in a healthy episode of a possible USS patient, usually sets the trigger to perform a molecular analysis of the ADAMTS13 gene to confirm a mutation. In unclear cases a plasma infusion trial can be done, showing a USS in the absence of anti-ADAMTS13-antibodies a full recovery of infused plasma-ADAMTS13 activity as well as a plasma half-life of infused ADAMTS13 activity of 2–4 days. A deficiency of ADAMTS13 activity in first-degree relatives is also a very strong indicator for an Upshaw–Schulman syndrome.[1][2][9]",
    "Treatment": "The therapy of an acute TTP episode has to be started as early as possible.[1][2] The standard treatment is the daily replacement of the missing ADAMTS13 protease in form of plasma infusions or in more severe episodes by plasma exchange. In the latter the patients plasma is replaced by donated plasma.[23] The most common sources of ADAMTS13 is platelet-poor fresh frozen plasma (FFP)[3] or solvent-detergent plasma.\nThe benefit of plasma exchange compared to plasma infusions alone may result from the additional removal of ULvWF.[1][23] In general both plasma therapies are well tolerated, several mostly minor complications may be observed.[2][23] The number of infusion/exchange sessions needed to overcome a TTP episode are variable but usually take less than a week in USS.[1][9] The intensive plasma-therapy is generally stopped when platelet count increases to normal levels and is stable over several days.[1][2]",

    "Disease": "Urbach–Wiethe disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Urbach–Wiethe disease is characterized by both neurological and dermatological symptoms.[14][15]",
    "Cause": "Researchers have mapped Urbach–Wiethe disease to chromosome 1 at 1q21 and specifically identified the extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1) gene as the gene containing mutations that can lead to the development of the condition.[12] At this point, 41 different mutations within ECM1 have been reported to lead to Urbach–Wiethe disease.[13] These were all homozygous loss-of-function mutations (i.e. nonsense, frameshift or internal deletions).[9] It is an autosomal recessive condition,[2][13] requiring two mutated copies of the ECM1 gene to cause the disease.[20]\nECM1 codes for a glycoprotein of previously unknown origin.  The discovery that the loss of ECM1 expression leads to the symptoms associated with Urbach–Wiethe disease suggests that ECM1 may contribute to skin adhesion, epidermal differentiation, and wound healing and scarring.[12]  It is also thought to play a role in endochondral bone formation, tumor biology, endothelial cell proliferation and blood vessel formation.[9]\nThe dermatological symptoms are caused by a buildup of a hyaline material in the dermis and the thickening of the basement membranes in the skin.[9] The nature of this material is unknown, but researchers have suggested that it may be a glycoprotein, a glycolipid, an acid mucopolysaccharide, altered collagen or elastic tissue.[6]",
    "Diagnosis": "Urbach–Wiethe disease is typically diagnosed by its clinical dermatological manifestations, particularly the beaded papules on the eyelids.  Doctors can also test the hyaline material with a periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining, as the material colors strongly for this stain.[6]\nImmunohistochemical skin labeling for antibodies for the ECM1 protein as labeling has been shown to be reduced in the skin of those affected by Urbach–Wiethe disease.[13]  Staining with anti-type IV collagen antibodies or anti-type VII collagen antibodies reveals bright, thick bands at the dermoepidermal junction.[9]\nNon-contrast CT scans can image calcifications, but this is not typically used as a means of diagnosing the disease.  This is partly due to the fact that not all Urbach-Wiethe patients exhibit calcifications, but also because similar lesions can be formed from other diseases such as herpes simplex and encephalitis.  The discovery of mutations within the ECM1 gene has allowed the use of genetic testing to confirm initial clinical diagnoses of Urbach–Wiethe disease.  It also allows doctors to better distinguish between Urbach–Wiethe disease and other similar diseases not caused by mutations in ECM1.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Currently, there is no cure for Urbach–Wiethe disease although there are some ways to individually treat many of its symptoms.  There has been some success with oral dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and intralesional heparin, but this is not true in all cases.[9][19] D-penicillamine has also shown promise, but has yet to have been used extensively.[13]  There are also some reports of patients being treated with etretinate, a drug typically prescribed to treat psoriasis.[17] In some cases, calcifications in the brain can lead to abnormal electrical activity among neurons.  Some patients are given anti-seizure medication to help deal with these abnormalities.  Tracheostomy is often used to relieve upper respiratory tract infections. Carbon dioxide laser surgery of thickened vocal cords and beaded eyelid papules have improved these symptoms for patients.[9]  The discovery of the mutations of the ECM1 gene has opened the possibility of gene therapy or a recombinant EMC1 protein for Urbach–Wiethe disease treatment, but neither of these two options are currently available.[citation needed]",

    "Disease": "Urofacial syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Infants with the disorder exhibit an inverted smile; they appear to be crying when they are actually smiling, in conjunction with uropathy. They also may be affected by hydronephrosis. Symptoms of this disease can start at very young ages. Many people with this syndrome will die in their teens to early 20s because of the renal failure (uropathy) if not diagnosed and treated. Children with the syndrome have abnormal facial development that cause an inverted smile; nerve connections are however normal. When attempting to smile, the child will appear to cry. Urinary problems arise as a result of a neurogenic bladder. Most patients older than the age of toilet training, present with enuresis, urinary-tract infection, hydronephrosis, and a spectrum of radiological abnormalities typical of obstructive or neurogenic bladders. Radiological abnormalities include things such as: trabeculated bladder, vesicoureteral reflex, external sphincter spasm, pyelonephritis, hyperreflexic bladder, noninhibited detrusor contraction, etc. Urinary abnormalities might result in renal deterioration and failure. This can be prevented by taking proper measures to restore normal micturition and by taking antibiotics to prevent infections. In some cases, the affected patients become hypertensive and progress to end-stage renal disease, while others become uremic. Additionally, most patients suffer from constipation.[3]\nEarly detection of this syndrome is possible through the peculiar faces that children present.[citation needed]",
    "Cause": "Urofacial syndrome occurs due to either disruption or mutation of a gene on chromosome 10q23q24.[4] The gene is located on a 1 centimorgan interval between D10S1433 and D10S603.[3] Alteration of this gene leads to alteration of facial and urinary developmental fields. This gene is believed to be the HPSE2 gene. The HPSE2 gene is expressed in both the central nervous system as well as the bladder. Heparanase 2 is protein coded by exons 8 and 9 on the HPSE2 gene. This protein is believed to be altered in the case of this syndrome.[2] Studies performed on mice indicate that HPSE2 has no enzymatic activity.[5]\nMutations in the HPSE2 gene on chromosome 10q23q24 have been observed to cause Ochoa Syndrome. This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome (chromosome 10 is an autosome), and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder.[citation needed]\nThe relationship between a defective HPSE2 gene and Ochoa syndrome is unclear. Early on, there was speculation that the genetic changes may lead to an abnormality in the brain stem. Evidence for this postulation was that the areas of the brain that control facial expression (VII nerve nuclei) and urination (the pontine micturition centre) were believed to be in close proximity of each other. Other hypotheses posit that the defective heparanase 2 protein may lead to problems with development of the urinary tract autonomic nervous system, or with muscle function in the face and bladder.[6]",
    "Diagnosis": "N/A",
    "Treatment": "The treatment varies based on the condition and extent of the uropathy. \nTo empty the bladder regularly, clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) can be used. If the urodynamic study shows non-inhibited detrusor contractions, an anticholinergic drug should be given additionally. To prevent recurrent infections, especially in the case of vesicoureteral reflux, the treatment can also include an antibiotic prophylaxis.[citation needed]",

    "Disease": "Urticaria pigmentosa",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Urticaria pigmentosa is characterized by excessive amounts of mast cells in the skin.  Red or brown spots are often seen on the skin, typically around the chest, forehead, and back.  These mast cells, when irritated (e.g. by rubbing the skin, heat exposure), produce too much histamine, triggering an allergic reaction that leads to hives localized to the area of irritation, sometimes referred to as Darier's sign.  Severe itching usually follows, and scratching the area only serves to further symptoms.  Symptoms can be mild (flushing and hives that require no treatment), moderate (diarrhea, tachycardia, nausea/vomiting, headache, and fainting), or life-threatening (vascular collapse requiring emergency treatment and hospitalization).[citation needed]",
    "Cause": "The majority of urticaria pigmentosa cases are caused by a point mutation at amino acid 816 of the proto-oncogene c-kit.[2]  c-kit is a transmembrane protein which, when bound to Mast Cell Growth Factor (MCGF), signals the cell to divide.  Mutations in position 816 of c-kit can result in a constant division signal being sent to the mast cells, resulting in abnormal proliferation.  Different mutations have been linked to different onset times of the disease.  \nFor example, the Asp816Phe and Asp816Val mutations (the aspartate normally at position 816 in the c-kit protein has been replaced with phenylalanine or valine respectively) have been associated with early manifestation of the disease (mean age of onset: 1.3 and 5.9 months respectively).[3][4] \nThe c-kit gene is encoded on the q12 locus of chromosome 4.[5]",
    "Diagnosis": "The disease is most often diagnosed as an infant, when parents take their baby in for what appears to be bug bites.  The bug bites are actually the clumps of mast cells.  Doctors can confirm the presence of mast cells by rubbing the baby's skin.  If hives appear, it most likely signifies the presence of urticaria pigmentosa.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "There are no permanent cures for urticaria pigmentosa.  However, treatments are possible.  Most treatments for mastocytosis can be used to treat urticaria pigmentosa.  Many common anti-allergy medications are useful because they reduce the mast cell's ability to react to histamine.[7]\nAt least one clinical study suggested that nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker used to treat high blood pressure, may reduce mast cell degranulation in patients with urticaria pigmentosa.  A 1984 study by Fairly et al. included a patient with symptomatic urticaria pigmentosa who responded to nifedipine taken three times daily.[8] However, nifedipine has never been approved by the FDA for treatment of urticaria pigmentosa.\nAnother mast cell stabilizer, Gastrocrom, a form of cromoglicic acid, has also been used to reduce mast cell degranulation.[citation needed]",

    "Disease": "Uterus didelphys",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Those with the condition may be asymptomatic and unaware of having a double uterus. However, a study by Heinonen showed that certain conditions are more common. In his study of 26 women with a double uterus gynecological complaints included dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia. All patients displayed a double vagina. The fetal survival rate in 18 patients who delivered was 67.5%. Premature delivery occurred in 21% of the pregnancies. Breech presentation occurred in 43% of women and cesarean section was performed in 82% of the cases.[1]",
    "Cause": "The uterus is formed during embryogenesis by the fusion of the two paramesonephric ducts (also called Müllerian ducts). This process usually fuses the two Müllerian ducts into a single uterine body but fails to take place in these affected patients who maintain their double Müllerian systems. A  didelphic uterus will have a double cervix and is usually associated with a double vagina. The cause of the fusion failure is not known. Associated defects may affect the vagina, the renal system and, less commonly, the skeleton.[citation needed]\nThe condition is less common than these other uterine malformations: arcuate uterus, septate uterus, and bicornuate uterus. It has been estimated to occur in 1/3,000 women.[2] In contrast, a unicornuate uterus (in which the Müllerian ducts may or may not fuse but one does not develop properly into uterine tissue) appears to be even rarer still.",
    "Diagnosis": "A pelvic examination will typically reveal a double vagina and a double cervix. Investigations are usually prompted on the basis of such findings as well as when reproductive problems are encountered. Not all cases of uterus didelphys involve duplication of the cervix and vagina.[citation needed]\nHelpful techniques to investigate the uterine structure are transvaginal ultrasonography and sonohysterography, hysterosalpingography, MRI, and hysteroscopy. More recently 3-D ultrasonography has been advocated as an excellent non-invasive method to evaluate uterine malformations.[4]\nUterus didelphys is often confused with a complete uterine septum. Often more than one method of investigation is necessary to accurately diagnose the condition. Correct diagnosis is crucial as treatment for these two conditions are very different.[5] Whereas most doctors recommend removal of a uterine septum, they generally concur that it is better not to operate on a uterus didelphys. In either case, a highly qualified reproductive endocrinologist should be consulted.",

    "Management": "Patients with a double uterus may need special attention during pregnancy as premature birth and malpresentation are common. Cesarean section was performed in 82% of patients reported by Heinonen.[1]\nUterus didelphys, in certain studies, has also been found associated with higher rate of infertility, miscarriage, intrauterine growth restriction, and postpartum bleed.[5]"

    "Disease": "Vaginal hypoplasia",

Diagnostically, it may look similar to a vaginal obstruction such as can be caused by an imperforate hymen or, less commonly, a transverse vaginal septum.[citation needed]\nIt is frequently associated with Mayer-Rokitansky-Küstner-Hauser syndrome, in which the most common result is an absent uterus in conjunction with a deformed or missing vagina, despite the presence of normal ovaries and normal external genitalia. It is also associated with cervical agenesis, in which the uterus is present but the uterine cervix is absent. The situation is most urgent where there is a menstruating uterus with an obstructed uterovaginal outflow, leading to hematometra. In this case prompt medical action is required.[citation needed]",
    "Cause": "The main causes are Müllerian agenesis and complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.[1]",
    "Diagnosis": "N/A",
    "Treatment": "In order to facilitate sexual intercourse, the main treatments are self-dilation methods (using intra-vaginal cylinders or inflatable expanders (vaginal stents) of increasing size) and surgical vaginoplasty to lengthen the vagina.[1] Self-dilation has a high success rate, estimated at 75%, and is usually the first-line treatment due to low surgical invasiveness.[1] Overall, the complication rates are significantly lower with dilation  than with vaginoplasty.[1]\nSurgery is indicated when there is inability or reluctance to perform self-dilation, or where it is performed but with failed result. The vaginoplasty is performed around the inflatable expander which maintains the neovagina against the pelvic wall after the surgery and favors the process of microscopic neovascularization while reducing the risks for hematoma.[2][3] One appropriate surgical variant is the Vecchietti technique. In this procedure, an olive-shaped pressure device is pressed towards the potential vaginal space by a thread that goes through the skin, behind the urinary bladder and pubic bone and exits the skin in the hypogastrium, where it is attached to a plate that provides counter-traction.[1] Vaginoplasty can also be performed using a skin graft or an intestinal graft. Traction vaginoplasty such as the Vecchietti technique seems to have the highest success rates both anatomically (99%) and functionally (96%), whereas skin graft procedures and intestinal procedures have the lowest successful outcomes (83–95%).[1]\nAfter vaginoplasty, available evidence suggests that continued self-dilation is needed to maintain the patency in periods of coital inactivity.[1] A vaginal expander can be used regularly to prevent post-operative vaginal retraction.[4]",

All of which cause the enzyme to function differently in the mitochondria, or in some cases not at all.[4] Due to this mutation, effective levels of very long-chain-acyl-CoA-dehydrogenase are low or absent in the body, giving rise to the array of symptoms listed above.[4][7]",

Some of the first symptoms of a metabolic crisis are: extreme sleepiness, behavior changes, irritable mood, poor appetite.\nSome of these other symptoms of VLCAD in infants may also follow: fever, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, hypoglycemia. Evaluation of symptom combinations can aid in a positive diagnosis of VLCAD.[9] Since symptoms vary depending on age and onset of the patient, consultation with a metabolic specialist should be considered. Diagnosis is further confirmed through genetic analysis of the VLCAD gene.[9]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment and management of VLCAD deficiency involve dietary restrictions as well as implementation of proper hydration to avoid further complications.  Hospitalization due to VLCAD deficiency can be treated with intravenous (IV) glucose for hydration and alkalization of urine and prevention of renal malfunction or failure.[10]  Avoidance of fasting periods, high-fat diets, and dehydration is recommended for those who are affected.  A diet consisting of low-fat intake and supplemental calories is common for management of VLCAD deficiency.  If a metabolic crisis is not treated, a child with VLCAD can develop: breathing problems, seizures, coma, sometimes leading to death.[citation needed]",

    "Disease": "Vestibular schwannoma",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Sporadic VSs originate within the confining bony walls of the small (ca. 2 cm long) internal auditory canal. The most common early symptoms of these intracanalicular (IAC) VSs are gradual hearing loss and a feeling of fullness in the affected ear, some imbalance or dizziness, and tinnitus (ringing or other noise in the ear).[13] Gradual single-sided hearing loss in the high frequencies is the first most obvious symptom for the great majority of patients. Headache as a presenting symptom of VS specifically is rare; facial symptoms (facial numbness, weakness) usually occur only as the tumor grows out of the canal and/or after therapeutic treatment. Delayed diagnosis and misdiagnosis are not unusual. Initial hearing loss is usually subtle and may be attributed mistakenly to aging, earwax buildup, or perhaps exposure to some loud environmental noise. A sudden hearing loss, which is uncommon, might be misdiagnosed as Ménière's disease, an abnormality of the inner ear that also has tinnitus as a symptom. The brain's vestibular system usually compensates for early balance problems.\nThere have been cases of tumors that were actually asymptomatic until very large and at a critical stage. Tumor growth rates are highly variable: some small VSs (perhaps 50%) do not grow at all; some few grow for a time and then shrink; some appear dormant but suddenly grow rapidly. In general, although studies differ, VSs that grow are slow-growing at an average rate of 1.2 to 1.9 mm per year. IAC tumors that grow beyond 1.5 cm in diameter expand into the relatively empty space of the cerebellopontine angle, taking on the characteristic 'ice-cream-cone' appearance seen on MRIs. As 'space-occupying-lesions,' the tumors can reach 3 to 4 cm or more in size and infringe on the facial nerve (facial expression) and trigeminal nerve (facial sensation). Advanced hearing loss and spells of true vertigo may occur. Very large tumors are life-threatening when they press on the cerebellum or cause brainstem compression. Late symptoms of very large VS include headache, nausea, vomiting, sleepiness, mental confusion and eventually coma.[3][4]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "Preliminary diagnostic procedures include ear examination, hearing and vestibular testing. Typical symptoms include unilateral tinnitus, progressive hearing loss and vertigo. Usually diagnostic sensitivity is increased with one or more otological symptom. The rate of VS pick up with unilateral tinnitus alone using MRI has been shown to be <0.1%.[18] The auditory brainstem response test (ABR) is a cost-effective test to see if a VS has perhaps compromised the cochlear nerve.[citation needed]\nComputed tomography (CT scan) of the head will detect moderate to large sized VS but can miss small sized VS. VS appears as isodense to surrounding brain parenchyma on CT. VS does not have calcifications in it. A large VS may expand the size of internal acoustic meatus (IAC) and may compromise hearing function because the nerves within the IAC are compressed, particularly the cochlear nerve. However, the facial nerve is less commonly affected. The main advantage of a CT scan is to assess the extent of bony involvement by VS. VS enhances when iodinated contrast is given. A contrasted CT scan of the temporal bone can be done if the patient is unable to undergo MRI scan.[19]\nMRI scan is the imaging of choice because it can more accurately differentiate the mass from other tumors such as meningioma, facial nerve schwannoma, epidermoid cyst, arachnoid cyst, aneurysm, and brain metastasis. MRI scan also helps in surgical planning and follow-up of the tumor after surgery.[19] VS is usually isointense on T1 weighted images, hyperintense on T2 weighted images, and enhances after given gadolinium contrast.[20]",

    "Disease": "Vestigial twin",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Woman who are pregnant do not experience any different symptoms when carrying vestigial twins compared to a normal pregnancy.\nOnce the fetus is born, the presentation will typically consist of an extra extremity attached to the dominant twins body. Only the dominant fetus will be viable. The limbs attached will contain nerve endings, bones, and tissue. In some cases, the fetus can be born with a attached limb as a \"tail.\" This tail is the extension of the coccygeal vertebra.[2] The parasitic twins limbs can be attached to the dominant twin at more than one location, for example the head, torso, pelvis, buttocks, back, etc. [3]",
    "Cause": "This phenomenon occurs when a fertilized ovum or partially formed embryo splits incompletely. The result is one dominant twin with extra body parts belonging to the vestigial twin. It is also possible for tail-like tissue to form around the sacrum.[2] One theory proposes that the usage of teratogenic drugs by the mother may be a factor in the development of vestigial parasitic twins. The cause for vestigial twins is still unclear.[4]\nThere is no way to prevent this from occurring. This disease is not contagious and occurs rarely in pregnancies. There are currently no Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations on this, as this is a rare occurrence.[3]",
    "Diagnosis": "Early diagnosis can be found during a prenatal ultrasound. A prenatal ultrasound uses sound waves to show the fetus in the womb.[5] However, there have been cases that it was not possible to diagnose the vestigial twin before birth using an ultrasound. There is no way to prevent vestigial twins or diagnose vestigial twins through pregnancy symptoms.Vestigial twins can be diagnosed before birth through an ultrasound or other imaging such as MRI or Ct scan. An MRI or CT scan can show how the twins are connected, After birth the diagnoses can be made by looking at the parasitic twin attached to the vestigial twin. An obstetric and gynecology physician can be treat and diagnose this patient, however a pregnant women would be referred to a maternal and fetal medicine specialist. It is possible to have different surgeons assigned to the case to assist with removing the parasitic twin. There have been cases where it is difficult to visualize the parasitic twins on an ultrasound, which would cause a delay in diagnoses until birth. If the expecting mother does not receive prenatal visits a delay in diagnosis would occur. However, once the vestigial twins are born it would be easily diagnosed during a physical exam.[6]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment for vestigial twins typically includes having surgery to remove the parasitic twin. If the parasitic twin is not removed the risk for further complications increases significantly. The twin supporting the parasitic twin can have complications. Therefore, the best course of treatment would be to remove the attached parasitic twin. A healthcare provider would schedule additional tests to check to see if the fetus has any complications and treat them. Treatment for other complications would be different based on each case. [1]\nAfter the fetus undergoes the procedure to remove the parasitic twin there is a risk to developing infection, hernia, and typical surgical complications. There are no holistic treatment options other than leaving the parasitic twin attached, however leaving the parasitic twin attached to the dominant twin can lead to further complications for the dominant twin. The dominant twins body can be put under a lot of stress if still attached to the parasitic twin. Surgery to remove the parasitic twin is the only treatment to remove the parasitic twin from the dominant twin.[1]",

As a result, loss of vision is very common. However, other organs can be affected: strokes, heart attacks, and cardiovascular disease are common additional symptoms.[6] Approximately 40% of VHL disease presents with CNS hemangioblastomas and they are present in around 60–80%. Spinal hemangioblastomas are found in 13–59% of VHL disease and are specific because 80% are found in VHL disease.[10][11] Although all of these tumors are common in VHL disease, around half of cases present with only one tumor type.[11] Most people with VHL develop symptoms in their mid-twenties.[12]",

    "Diagnosis": "The detection of tumours specific to VHL disease is important in the disease's diagnosis. In individuals with a family history of VHL disease, one hemangioblastoma, pheochromocytoma or renal cell carcinoma may be sufficient to make a diagnosis. As all the tumours associated with VHL disease can be found sporadically, at least two tumours must be identified to diagnose VHL disease in a person without a family history.[10][11][19]\nGenetic diagnosis is also useful in VHL disease diagnosis. In hereditary VHL disease, techniques such as the Southern blot and gene sequencing can be used to analyse DNA and identify mutations. These tests can be used to screen family members of those afflicted with VHL disease; de novo cases that produce genetic mosaicism are more difficult to detect because mutations are not found in the white blood cells that are used for genetic analysis.[10][20]",
    "Treatment": "Early recognition and treatment of specific manifestations of VHL can substantially decrease complications and improve quality of life. For this reason, individuals with VHL disease are usually screened routinely for retinal angiomas, CNS hemangioblastomas, clear-cell renal carcinomas and pheochromocytomas.[26] CNS hemangioblastomas are usually surgically removed if they are symptomatic. Photocoagulation and cryotherapy are usually used for the treatment of symptomatic retinal angiomas, although anti-angiogenic treatments may also be an option. Renal tumours may be removed by a partial nephrectomy or other techniques such as radiofrequency ablation.[10]\nBelzutifan is a drug approved for the treatment of von Hippel–Lindau disease-associated renal cell carcinoma and sold by Merck under the name Welireg.[27][28]",

This ability to move to other locations is commonly attributed to the spleen's pedicle being abnormally long.[3]\nPhysical factors may cause ischuria, constipation, as well as numerous spleen-related diseases such as hypersplenism, thrombocytopenia, and lymphoma.[4] Blocking of the arteries and torsion (twisting that interrupts the blood supply to that organ) in the spleen can also result in abdominal pain or swelling.[5] However, lack of visible symptoms — except in incidents of abdominal pain — makes the disease difficult for doctors to diagnose,[6] though medical imaging techniques such as medical ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, or computed tomography can be used to confirm its occurrence. Characteristics of the disorder include the loss, weakening, or malformation of the ligaments[2] that help to keep the spleen located in the upper left part of the abdomen.[citation needed]",

    "Cause": "The cause for Weaver syndrome was identified in 2011 as autosomal dominant mutations in the EZH2 gene on chromosome 7q36.[2] EZH2 (Enhancer of Zeste, Drosophila, homolog 2) is the second histone methyltransferase associated with human overgrowth. It encodes the catalytic component of the PRC2 protein complex (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2), which regulates chromatin structure and gene expression, and has been found to repress transcription. EZH2 also has critical roles in stem cell maintenance and cell lineage determination, such as osteogenesis, myogenesis, lymphopoiesis and hematopoiesis.\nIt can also be associated with mutations in the histone methyltransferase NSD1 gene on chromosome 5q35. The functions of NSD1 are not clearly known, but it is thought to act as a factor in influencing transcription, which contains domains involved in chromatin-mediated regulation during development.[8]\nMost cases are found to be sporadic, with no family history of the syndrome, although there have been a few cases in families where autosomal dominant inheritance has been reported.[9]",

    "Disease": "Werner syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The mutation in the WRN gene that causes Werner syndrome is autosomal and recessive, meaning that affected people must inherit a copy of the gene from each parent. Patients display rapid premature aging beginning in young adulthood, usually in their early twenties.[16] Diagnosis is based on six cardinal symptoms: premature graying of the hair or hair loss, presence of bilateral cataracts, atrophied or tight skin, soft tissue calcification, sharp facial features, and an abnormal, high-pitched voice.[17] Patients are generally short-statured due to absence of the adolescent growth spurt. Patients also display decreased fertility.[18] The most common symptom of the six is premature graying and loss of hair. This is also generally the earliest observed symptom, with hair loss occurring first on the scalp and the eyebrows.[18]\nWerner syndrome patients often have skin that appears shiny and tight, and may also be thin or hardened.[16][18] This is due to atrophy of the subcutaneous tissue and dermal fibrosis.[18] Over time, the characteristic facial features may be more apparent due to these skin conditions. Other associated skin conditions include ulcers,[18] which are very difficult to treat in Werner syndrome patients, and are caused in part by decreased potential of skin cells for replication.[19]\nWS cataracts are distinctly different from those of normal aging. They are associated with problems in the lens posterior cortex and subcapsular regions. These cataracts are generally treatable with cataract surgery, which should restore normal vision.[18]\nSymptoms become apparent in the late teens and early twenties and continue to progress. Most patients live to about fifty years of age. The most common causes of death for people are associated diseases and complications, especially atherosclerosis and cancer.[16]",
    "Cause": "Approximately 90% of individuals presenting Werner syndrome have any of a range of mutations in the gene, WRN, the only gene currently attributed to cause Werner syndrome.[11][12] WRN, which lies on chromosome 8 in humans,[22] encodes the WRNp protein, a 1432 amino acid protein with a central domain resembling members of the RecQ helicases. RecQ helicases are a special type of helicase that function at unique times during DNA repair of doubled stranded breaks, which are a form of DNA damage that results in a break of both strands of DNA. Thus, RecQ helicases are important for maintaining DNA stability, and loss of function of these helicases has important implications in the development of Werner syndrome.[23] In addition to the central domain, there are three exonuclease domains at the N-terminus and a Helicase and Ribonuclease D C-terminal (HRDC) domain at the C-terminus.[24]\nWhen functioning normally, the WRN gene and its associated protein (WRNp) are important for maintaining genome stability.[20] WRNp is active in unwinding DNA, a step necessary in DNA repair and DNA replication.[3][7] Specifically, it has an important role in responding to replication malfunctions, particularly double-stranded breaks, and stalled replication machinery.[20] WRNp may reactivate replication by preventing unwanted recombination processes from occurring or by promoting recombination, depending on the type of DNA damage. In addition, WRNp physically interacts with or binds to several other proteins that are involved in processing DNA.[25] For example, when WRNp binds to RPA, its helicase activity is stimulated. WRNp also physically interacts with p53, a tumor suppressor gene that stops the formation of tumors and the progression of cancers,[26] which inhibits the exonuclease activity of the WRNp.[27] Since WRNp's function depends on DNA, it is only functional when localized to the nucleus.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "N/A",
    "Treatment": "A cure for Werner syndrome has not yet been discovered. It is often treated by managing the associated diseases and relieving symptoms to improve quality of life. The skin ulcers that accompany WS can be treated in several ways, depending on the severity. Topical treatments can be used for minor ulcers, but are not effective in preventing new ulcers from occurring. In the most severe cases, surgery may be required to implant a skin graft or amputate a limb if necessary. Diseases commonly associated with WS such as diabetes and cancer are treated in generally the same ways as they would be for a non-Werner syndrome individual. A change in diet and exercise can help prevent and control arteriosclerosis, and regular cancer screenings can allow for early detection of cancer.[41]\nThere is evidence that suggests that the cytokine-suppressive anti-inflammatory drug SB203580 may be a possible therapeutic option for patients with WS. This drug targets the p38 signaling pathway, which may become activated as a result of genomic instability and stalled replication forks that are characteristic mutations in WS. This activation of p38 may play a role in the onset of premature cell aging, skin aging, cataracts, and graying of the hair. The p38 pathway has also been implicated in the inflammatory response that causes atherosclerosis, diabetes, and osteoporosis, all of which are associated with WS. This drug has shown to revert the aged characteristics of young WS cells to those seen in normal, young cells and improve the lifespan of WS cells in vitro. SB203580 is in the clinical trial stages, and the same results have not yet been seen in vivo.[42]\nIn 2010, vitamin C supplementation was found to reverse the premature aging and several tissue dysfunctions in a genetically modified mouse model of the disease. Vitamin C supplementation also appeared to normalize several age-related molecular markers such as the increased levels of the transcription factor NF-κB. In addition, it decreases activity of genes activated in human WS and increases gene activity involved in tissue repair. Supplementation of vitamin C is suspected to be beneficial in the treatment of human WS, although there was no evidence of anti-aging activity in nonmutant mice.[43] In general, treatments are available for only the symptoms or complications and not for the disease itself.[44]",

    "Treatment": "Infusions of immune globulin can reduce the frequency of bacterial infections, and G-CSF or GM-CSF therapy improves blood neutrophil counts.[5]\nAs WHIM syndrome is a molecular disease arising from gain-of-function mutations in CXCR4, preclinical studies identified plerixafor, a specific CXCR4 antagonist, as a potential mechanism-based therapeutic for the disease.[6] Two subsequent clinical trials involving a handful of patients with WHIM syndrome demonstrated that plerixafor could increase white blood cell counts and continues to be a promising targeted therapy.[7][8]\nA woman with spontaneous remission of her WHIM syndrome due  to chromothripsis in one of her blood stem cells has been identified.[9][10]\nIn support of these studies, a 2014 phase I clinical trial treated three patients diagnosed with WHIM syndrome with plerixafor twice a day for six months. All three patients presented with multiple reoccurring infections before treatment and all had an increase in their white blood cell count post treatment. One patient (P3) had a decrease in his infections by 40% while the remaining two patients (P1 and P2) had no infections throughout the entirety of the treatment. Plerixafor may also prove to have anti-human papillomavirus (HPV) properties as all patients experienced a shrinkage or complete disappearance of their warts. While this treatment shows promise in treating neutropenia (decreased white blood cells), this trial showed no increase of immune globulins in the body.[11] A phase III clinical trial has been approved to compare the infection prevention ability of plerixafor versus the current treatment of G-CSF in patients with WHIM.[12]\nMavorixafor (Xolremdi) is a small-molecule drug that targets CXCR4 mutations, it was approved for medical use in the United States in April of 2024.[13]",

The extreme rarity of the condition (estimated at 1 in 200,000 people) means that clinical evaluation of treatment options is based on very small sample sizes, often a single patient.

Most have slightly abnormal liver function tests such as raised aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and bilirubin levels. Alkaline phosphatase levels are relatively low in those with Wilson's-related acute liver failure.[20] If the liver damage is significant, albumin may be decreased due to an inability of damaged liver cells to produce this protein; likewise, the prothrombin time (a test of coagulation) may be prolonged as the liver is unable to produce proteins known as clotting factors.[5] If neurological symptoms are seen, magnetic resonance imaging  of the brain is usually performed; this shows hyperintensities in the part of the brain called the basal ganglia in the T2 setting.[14] MRI may also demonstrate the characteristic \"face of the giant panda\" pattern.[21]\nNo totally reliable test for Wilson's disease is known, but levels of ceruloplasmin and copper in the blood, as well of the amount of copper excreted in urine during a 24-hour period, are together used to form an impression of the amount of copper in the body.

    "Disease": "Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "WAS occurs most often in males due to its X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance, affecting between 1 and 10 males per million.[1] The first signs are usually petechiae and bruising, resulting from a low platelet count (i.e. thrombocytopenia). Spontaneous nose bleeds and bloody diarrhea are also common and eczema typically develops within the first month of life. Recurrent bacterial infections typically develop by three months of age. The majority of children with WAS develop at least one autoimmune disorder, and cancers (mainly lymphoma and leukemia) develop in up to a third of patients.[3] Immunoglobulin M (IgM) levels are reduced, IgA and IgE are elevated, and IgG levels can be normal, reduced, or elevated.[4] In addition to thrombocytopenia, WAS patients have abnormally small platelets (i.e. microthrombocytes) and ~30% also have elevated eosinophil  counts (i.e. eosinophilia).[5]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis can be made on the basis of clinical findings, the peripheral blood smear, and low immunoglobulin levels. Typically, IgM levels are low, IgA levels are elevated, and IgE levels may be elevated; paraproteins are occasionally observed.[15] Skin immunologic testing (allergy testing) may reveal hyposensitivity. Individuals with Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome however are at higher risk for severe food allergies.[16] Not all patients have a positive family history of the disorder; new mutations do occur. Often, leukemia may be suspected on the basis of low platelets and infections, and bone marrow biopsy may be performed. Decreased levels of WASp are typically observed. The current gold standard for diagnosis is DNA sequence analysis, which can detect WAS and the related disorders XLT and XLN in 95% of patients and carriers.[17]",
    "Treatment": "Hematopoietic stem cell transplant\nTreatment of Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome depends on the severity of the disease. WAS is primarily a disorder of the blood-forming tissues, so in cases of severe disease (WAS score 3–5) the only widely available curative treatment currently available is a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT). In this procedure stem cells are harvested from umbilical cord blood, bone marrow, or peripheral blood following treatment with medications that cause stem cells to leave the bone marrow and circulate systemically. The best outcomes are with HLA-identical or similar donors (often siblings). In cases of milder disease the potential benefits of HCT (>90% probability of cure if transplant occurs before age two) must be considered in the context of non-trivial risks presented by the procedure itself and the potential need for lifelong immunosuppression to prevent graft-versus-host disease.[22][23] Generally outcomes are better if HCT occurs prior to the development of autoimmune disease or malignancy, however there are risks associated with chemotherapy (needed to make room for the new stem cells) especially in young infants (risk of a second cancer, or infertility).[citation needed]\nBleeding complications\nOtherwise WAS treatment is focused on managing symptoms and preventing complications. The greatest mortality risk in WAS before age 30 is from bleeding so aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that may interfere with already compromised platelet function should generally be avoided.[13] Circumcision, as well as elective surgeries, should generally be deferred in males with thrombocytopenia until after HCT if possible. Protective helmets can help protect children from life-threatening intracranial hemorrhage (brain bleed) which could result from head injuries.  Patients may require platelet transfusions when there is extreme bloodloss (such as during surgery) or for very low platelets splenectomy (removal of the spleen) may also be lifesaving.[24] However, splenectomy is generally considered palliative and is not universally recommended in WAS because it can increase the risk of life-threatening infections.[25][13] Post-splenectomy patients will require lifelong antibiotic prophyllaxis to prevent infections. Study of eltrombopag, a thrombopoietic agent used to increase platelets in immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), in WAS concluded that although it increased platelet numbers it failed to increase platelet activation in most patients.[26] It has since been proposed the eltrombopag may be used to bridge to HCT in patients with severe thrombocytopenia to normalize platelet numbers without transfusions and decrease bleeding events.[27] Anemia from bleeding may require iron supplementation or blood transfusion. Regular surveillance of blood counts is recommended.\nInfections and autoimmune disease\nFor patients with frequent infections, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) or subcutaneous immunoglobulins can be regularly scheduled to boost the immune system. Adequacy of IVIG replacement can be assessed via periodic lab draws. WAS patients with immune system compromise may benefit from antibiotic prophylaxis, for example by taking trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent Pneumocystis jirovecii-related pneumonia. Similarly, prophylactic antibiotic use may also be considered in patients with recurrent bacterial sinus or lung infections. When there are signs or symptoms of an infection, prompt and thorough evaluation is important including blood cultures to guide therapy (often IV antibiotics). Live vaccines (such as MMR or rotavirus) should be avoided during routine childhood vaccination. Inactivated vaccines may be given safely but may not provide protective levels of immunity. Eczema is generally treated with topical steroids, and if chronic skin infections exacerbate eczema an antibiotic may also be given. Autoimmune disease is managed with judicious use of appropriate immunosuppressants.[citation needed]\nGene therapy\nFor severely affected males without an HLA-matched donor, studies of correcting Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome with gene therapy using a lentivirus are underway.[28][29] Proof-of-principle for successful hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy has been provided for patients with Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome.[30] In July 2013 the Italian San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (HSR-TIGET) reported that three children with Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome showed significant improvement (improved platelet counts, immune functiona, and clinical symptoms) 20–30 months after being treated with a genetically modified lentivirus.[31] In April 2015 results from a follow-up British and French trial six out of seven individuals showed improvement of immune function and clinical symptoms an average of 27 months after treatment with gene therapy.[32][33][34] Importantly, neither study showed evidence of leukemic proliferation following treatment, a complication of early attempts at gene therapy using a retroviral vector.[35] It is unknown why these gene therapies did not restore normal platelet numbers, but gene therapy treatment was still associated with transfusion-independence and a significant reduction in bleeding events.[31][32] A version of this treatment, OTL-103, is being developed by Orchard Therapeutics and (as of 28 June 2021[update]) is undergoing Phase I/II clinical trials.",

The key way to test for this disease is through genetic testing for EIKF2AK3 mutations.[7] Molecular genetic analysis can be done for the patient and the parents to test for inherited or de novo mutations. It can also show whether the patient's parents are heterozygotes or homozygotes for the normal genotype.[4] X-rays can show bone age in relation to actual age. In typical WRS patients the bone age is a few years less than the chronological age.[4][5][8][9] Hypothyroidism is rare in WRS patients but can occur.[4]",

    "Disease": "Wolfram syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "N/A",
    "Cause": "Wolfram syndrome was initially thought to be caused by mitochondrial dysfunction due to several reports of mitochondrial DNA mutations. However, it has now been established that Wolfram syndrome is caused by a congenital endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dysfunction.[2]\nTwo forms have been described: Wolfram syndrome 1 (WFS1), and Wolfram syndrome 2 (WFS2).[2]",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of Wolfram syndrome is multifaceted, involving clinical evaluation, genetic testing, laboratory investigations, and imaging studies. Clinical evaluation typically begins with a detailed medical history and physical examination, where patients often present with juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus followed by progressive optic atrophy, a condition where the optic nerves, which connect the eyes to the brain, deteriorate over time, leading to vision loss.[18] There is an increased suspicion when diabetes is diagnosed in kids under 16. More evidence shows that Wolfram syndrome varies in how it appears.\nThe syndrome can present with various symptoms. In addition to diabetes and optic atrophy, patient may exhibit diabetes insipidus, a condition where the kidneys cannot retain water, leading to frequent urination and excessive thirst. They might also have sensorineural hearing loss, which is a type of hearing loss caused by damage to the inner ear or the nerves that connect the ear to the brain. Neurological abnormalities such as ataxia (lack of muscle coordination) or myoclonus (sudden, involuntary muscle jerks) may also be observed.[22] The progression of symptoms, starting with type 1 diabetes and subsequent vision loss within the first decade of life, is a critical diagnostic clue.[23]\nImaging studies are essential for understanding the extent of brain and optic nerve damage in Wolfram syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can show significant shrinkage of the brain stem and cerebellum, region of the brain in motor control and coordination. These change can resemble changes seen in other neurodegenerative disorders, which are diseases that involve the progressive loss of structure or function of neurons, including death of neurons.[24] Additionally, areas of the pons, part of the brainstem, may show increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images, indicating potential damage or changes in tissue composition. The connections between the cerebellum and the brainstem (middle cerebellar peduncles) can also exhibit atrophy, consistent with Wolfram syndrome. Changes in the optic radiations, which are the pathways transmitting visual information from the eyes to the brain, can be detected, aligning with the optic atrophy characteristic of Wolfram syndrome. Furthermore, the absence of the typical T1 hyperintensity in the posterior pituitary lobe suggests a lack of vasopressin-containing neurons, often linked with diabetes insipidus, another symptom of Wolfram syndrome. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is used to measure retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, aiding in the assessment of optic atrophy and monitoring disease progression .\nNowadays, genetic testing are used commonly to confirm the diagnosis of Wolfram syndrome. Initially, patient with hereditary optic neuropathy who tested negative for mutation in the common optic neuropathy genes OPA1, OPA3 and LHON were selected for further genetic testing for WS. The primary genetic lotus associated with this syndrome is WFS1, and Sanger sequencing ( a method of reading the genetic code) of this gene typically confirms the diagnosis.[25] Most patient exhibit recessive mutation in WFS1, meaning they inherited two copies of the mutated genes, one from each parents. However, some dominant mutation, such as H313Y, have been identified, where one copy of the mutated gene can cause the disorder.[26] These dominant mutation are often linked to low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, which affects the ability to hear low-pitched sounds. Additionally, there have been recent discoveries of autosomal dominant diabetes, where diabetes is inherited in a dominant manner, in patients with WFS1 mutations. Interpreting genetic testing results requires specialized knowledge due to the complexity of the mutation.[27]\nDetailed family history is important as WS2 inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, and genetic counseling is recommended for affected individuals and their families to understand the inheritance pattern, risks to other family members, and reproductive options.[28] A minority of patients have recessive mutation in the CISD2 (WFS2) gene, and for those without WFS1 mutations, Sanger sequencing of WFS2 is conducted.[29] Efforts are underway to develop diagnosis methods based on exome (sequencing all the protein-coding regions of the genes) and genome sequencing (sequencing the entire genetic code) for Wolfram syndrome and related disorder.[30]\nOther diagnostic tools include audiological tests to identify sensorineural hearing loss, a common feature of Wolfram syndrome, and psychiatric evaluations to address cognitive or behavioral issues arising from neurodegenerative nature of the disease. Audiological tests help assess the extent of hearing loss and guide interventions like hearing aids or other assistive devices. Psychiatric evaluations are important because the neurological aspects of Wolfram syndrome can lead to cognitive decline or behavioral changes, which require appropriate management and support. Combining these diagnostic approaches ensures a comprehensive understanding and management of Wolfram syndrome.[31]",
    "Treatment": "There is no known direct treatment. Current treatment efforts focus on managing the complications of Wolfram syndrome. Intranasal or oral desmopressin has been shown to improve symptoms for the treatment of diabetes insipidus caused by Wolfram syndrome.[10] Patients with Wolfram syndrome experiencing hearing loss have benefited from the use of cochlear implants and hearing aids.[32] While there are no therapies currently available to slow the progression of neurological manifestations, swallowing therapy and esophagomyotomy have been shown to be useful in alleviating some of the neurological symptoms.[33] Anticholinergic medications, clean intermittent catheterizations, electrical stimulation, and physiotherapy have been shown to be effective at managing urological abnormalities due to Wolfram syndrome such as neurogenic bladder and upper urinary tract dilation.[34]\nWhile there are no direct treatments, many therapies are currently being investigated for their efficacy at treating Wolfram syndrome. Gene and regenerative therapies are currently being studied for their efficacy in replacing damaged tissues due to Wolfram syndrome, such as pancreatic β-cells, neuronal, and retinal cells.[35]\nWFS1 mutations cause proteins in the ER to fold improperly, leading to ER stress. ER stress stimulates the unfolded protein response (UPR), which causes cell apoptosis for pancreatic β-cells.[36] Chemical chaperones are being investigated for their effect on reducing the UPR response and thus delaying disease progression by preventing cell death.[10]  The FDA has approved 4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA) and tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) as chemical chaperones to reduce ER stress to delay neurodegeneration in patients with Wolfram syndrome.[37] As of 2023, sodium valproate—an anti-epileptic drug—is being investigated as a therapy for Wolfram syndrome due to studies showing its ability to inhibit ER stress-induced apoptosis, reducing neurodegeneration.[38] Liraglutide—a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP 1-R) agonist—has been hypothesized to be an effective therapy, as it has been shown to improve diabetes mellitus, reduce cell death due to ER stress, reduce neuroinflammation, protect retinal ganglion cell death, and prevent optic nerve degeneration.[39]  Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors have also been hypothesized to be efficacious in the treatment of Wolfram syndrome due to their ability to activate GLP 1-R, similar to liraglutide.[40]  However, the efficacy and safety of using liraglutide and DPP-4 inhibitors for the treatment of Wolfram syndrome has not been well studied yet.\nER calcium levels have also been identified as a target for Wolfram syndrome therapy. WFS1 mutations increase cytosolic calcium, leading to the activation of cysteine proteases known as calpains. Increased calpains activation is associated which cell death.[41] As of 2021, dantrolene sodium—a medication indicated for the treatment of malignant hyperthermia and muscle spasms—was being investigated in patients with Wolfram syndrome in a phase 2 clinical trial.[42]\nOverall, there is currently no treatment guideline for treating or slowing down the progression of Wolfram Syndrome. Treatment is more so focused on treating and managing the symptoms. Research is still being conducted in finding more effective treatment strategies, including studies on drugs that can reduce dell damage, gene therapies, and regenerative therapies.[43]",

    "Diagnosis": "The clinical laboratory evaluation of rickets begins with assessing serum calcium, phosphate, and alkaline phosphatase levels. In hypophosphatemic rickets, calcium levels may be within or slightly below the reference range; alkaline phosphatase levels will be significantly above the reference range.Biochemically, XLH is recognized by hypophosphatemia.[36]\nCarefully evaluate serum phosphate levels in the first year of life, because the concentration reference range for infants (5.0–7.5 mg/dL) is high compared with that for adults (2.7–4.5 mg/dL).[citation needed]\nSerum parathyroid hormone levels are within the reference range or slightly elevated. calcitriol (1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3) levels are low or within the lower reference range. Most importantly, urinary loss of phosphate is above the reference range.[citation needed]\nThe renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate (TRP) in X-linked hypophosphatemia is 60%; normal TRP exceeds 90% at the same reduced plasma phosphate concentration. The TRP is calculated with the following formula:[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Conventional therapy consisted of medications including human growth hormone, calcitriol, and oral phosphate,[37][38] and calcitriol;[37][38] Unwanted effects of this therapy have included secondary hyperparathyroidism, nephrocalcinosis, kidney stones, and cardiovascular abnormalities.[citation needed]\nIn February 2018 the European Medicines Agency first licensed a monoclonal antibody directed against FGF23, the first drug targeting the underlying cause for this condition,[39] called burosumab.[40] It was then licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration in June 2018[41] Burosumab is shown to target the major symptoms of XLH by decreasing elevated alkaline phosphatase and normalizing severe hypophosphatemia, leading to substantial improvement of rickets in child and adolescent patients.[42]\nThe leg deformity can be treated with Ilizarov frames and CAOS.[43]\nIn the event of severe bowing, an osteotomy can be performed to correct the leg shape.[43]",

The extensor surfaces are typically the most severely affected areas.  The >4 mm diameter scales adhere to the underlying skin and can be dark brown or gray in color.  Symptoms may subside during the summer.[2]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "XLI can be suspected based on clinical findings, although symptoms can take varying amounts of time to become evident, from a few hours after birth, up to a year in milder cases.  The diagnosis is usually made by a dermatologist, who also typically formulates the treatment plan (see below).  STS enzyme deficiency is confirmed using a clinically available biochemical assay.  Carrier detection can be performed in mothers of affected sons using this test (see Genetics, below).[23]  Molecular testing for DNA deletions or mutations is also offered, and can be particularly useful in the evaluation of individuals with associated medical conditions (see below).  Prenatal diagnosis is possible using either biochemical or molecular tests.  However, the use of prenatal diagnosis for genetic conditions that are considered to be generally benign raises serious ethical considerations and requires detailed genetic counseling.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Because XLI is caused by a gene mutation or deletion, there is no \"cure.\"  One of the aims of treatment is to reduce scaling by removing the excess, flaky scales, and keep the skin hydrated.  This can be achieved using a variety of topical creams.[2][7] Other treatments involve\n• Keratolytic agents such as Ammonium lactate (Lac-Hydrin) are used to facilitate the release of retained corneocytes.[citation needed]\n• oral isotretinoin[citation needed]\n• acitretin[28]\n• The topical receptor-selective retinoid tazarotene [29]\nResearch is ongoing with regard to the use of gene therapy to treat XLI.[30] Timber Pharmaceuticals is planning on conducting a phase 3 trial of its investigational topical isotretinoin product in the second quarter of 2022 for the treatment of congenital ichthyosis.[31]",

They might have a large spleen or liver, as well as heart defects. Including holes in the heart, and high blood pressure. Due to the lack of muscle tone, infants can face respiratory problems as the disease progresses.[citation needed]",
    "Cause": "Zellweger spectrum disorders are a group of autosomal recessive genetic disorders. They are caused due to pathogenic mutations in at least 13 different PEX genes that encode peroxins.[5] It affects the peroxisomes, which are organelles in the body that are meant to breakdown items like acids and toxic compounds. Both parents will have to have the recessive gene for the child to show symptoms. If one parent has the gene and the other one does not, the child will be a carrier and will not show symptoms. Any mutation involving the genes that create or work the peroxisomes can lead to the development of any of the Zellweger Spectrum Disorders.

About one-half to two-thirds of single gastrinomas are malignant tumors that most commonly spread to the liver and to lymph nodes near the pancreas and small bowel.[8]\nNearly 25 percent of patients with gastrinomas have multiple tumors as part of a condition called multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1). MEN I patients have tumors in their pituitary gland and parathyroid glands, in addition to tumors of the pancreas.[9]",
    "Cause": "N/A",
    "Diagnosis": "Zollinger–Ellison syndrome may be suspected when the above symptoms prove resistant to treatment when the symptoms are especially suggestive of the syndrome, or when endoscopy is suggestive. The diagnosis is made through several laboratory tests and imaging studies:[13]\n• Secretin stimulation test, which measures evoked gastrin levels. Note that the mechanism underlying this test is in contrast to the normal physiologic mechanism whereby secretin inhibits gastrin release from G cells. Gastrinoma cells release gastrin in response to secretin stimulation,[14][15] thereby providing a sensitive means of differentiation.\n• Fasting gastrin levels on at least three occasions[16]\n• Gastric acid secretion and pH (normal basal gastric acid secretion is less than 10 mEq/hour; in Zollinger–Ellison patients, it is usually more than 15 mEq/hour)[17]\n• An increased level of chromogranin A is a common marker of neuroendocrine tumors.\nIn addition, the source of the increased gastrin production must be determined using MRI or somatostatin receptor scintigraphy.[18]\nDiagnosis can sometimes be very difficult, especially considering patients who take a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) medication for gastric reflux, which constitute a large and increasing proportion of people who develop Zollinger–Ellison syndrome. PPIs inadvertently increase gastrin production, which may cause a false positive for elevated gastrin levels. This can occur even in patients who have been off their medication for weeks, due to the long duration of effects of these medications.[6]",
    "Treatment": "Proton pump inhibitors (such as omeprazole and lansoprazole) and histamine H2-receptor antagonists (such as famotidine and ranitidine) are used to slow acid secretion. Once gastric acid is suppressed, symptoms normally improve. Surgery to remove peptic ulcers or tumors might also be considered.[19]",
