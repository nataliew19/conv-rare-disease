    "Disease": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency",
    "Signs and symptoms": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency can appear in a variety of ways in terms of clinical presentation, from a severe neonatal onset with potentially fatal consequences to an adult presentation.[1] Clinical signs of 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency appear either early in the neonatal stage or later in the first year of life.[3] Typically, nonspecific symptoms such as frequent vomiting, convulsions, and decreased alertness are displayed by patients. Typical laboratory results include higher plasma/serum transaminase activity, hyperammonemia, acidosis, hypoglycemia, and an increased anion gap.[1]",
    "Causes": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency is the result of HMGCL gene mutations.[1] HMGCL is found on chromosome 1p36.11's short arm and codes for the enzyme 3-hydroxymethyl-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A lyase (HMG-CoA lyase).[4][5] This mitochondrial enzyme contributes to the metabolism of dietary proteins by converting HMG-CoA into acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate, which is the last stage of the breakdown of leucine and fat for energy.[6] As a result, the body is unable to produce ketone bodies, which are necessary for generating energy during fasting.[7] 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency is passed down as an autosomal recessive trait.[2]",
    "Diagnosis": "Since 3-hydroxy isovaleryl carnitine (C5-OH) is typically elevated in this condition, 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency can be identified during newborn screening by testing it using tandem mass spectrometry methodology.[3] Enzyme activity testing in lymphocytes, immortalized lymphoblastoid cells, or fibroblasts, as well as HMGCL gene mutation studies, may confirm the diagnosis of 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency.[1]",
    "Treatment": "As with other uncommon inherited metabolic illnesses, there are no controlled treatment studies for 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency. Consequently, it is impossible to make any judgments about whether a particular diet or carnitine supplements are required. Clinical reports and pathobiochemical considerations suggest that the mainstay of therapy is avoiding fasting. L-carnitine supplementation may have detoxifying properties, prevent intracellular loss of free coenzyme A, and prevent secondary L-carnitine insufficiency.[14]",
    "Epidemiology": "The incidence of 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency is fewer than 1/100,000 live births.[15]"

    "Disease": "AA amyloidosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of amyloidosis can vary depending on the affected organ. AA amyloidosis commonly affects kidneys, liver, and stomach.[13]",
    "Causes": "AA amyloidosis is a complication of a number of inflammatory diseases and infections,[2] although only a small portion of patients with these conditions will go on to develop AA amyloidosis. The most common presentation of AA amyloidosis is renal in nature, including proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome  and progressive development of chronic kidney disease leading to end stage kidney disease (ESKD) and need for renal replacement therapy (e.g. dialysis or kidney transplantation).[3] A natural history study of AA amyloidosis patients reported a number of conditions associated with AA amyloidosis:[1]",
    "Diagnosis": "Tissue biopsy using subcutaneous abdominal fat tissue aspiration is typically used as it is safe and sensitive. It is also possible to biopsy the rectal mucosa or minor salivary glands. Amyloidosis is confirmed by histological identification of amyloid deposits. At this point, amyloid typing with immunochemical staining is necessary, as the differential diagnosis includes AA amyloidosis, AL amyloidosis, hereditary amyloidosis, dialysis-related amyloidosis and age-related systemic amyloidosis. Testing of serum and urine for monoclonal immunoglobulins and of serum for free light chains may help rule out immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis, while genetic testing may be used if hereditary amyloidosis is suspected.[16]",
    "Treatment": "There are currently no approved treatments for systemic AA amyloidosis.[17] The current standard of care includes treatments for the underlying inflammatory disease with anti-inflammatory drugs, immunosuppressive agents or biologics. AA amyloidosis patients are also receiving treatments to slow down the decline of their renal function, such as angiotensin II receptor blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.[20]"

    "Disease": "Abdominal epilepsy",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Abdominal epilepsy is marked by GI symptoms such as abdominal pain followed by uncontrollable vomiting, usually preceded by lethargy. Lethargy and confusion are the most common neurological symptoms associated with abdominal epilepsy. Other symptoms include generalized tonic-clonic seizures followed by sleep, and unresponsiveness.[10][11] Abdominal aura characterized by abdominal sensations precedes the abdominal seizure. This is associated with pain, nausea, hunger, gassiness, especially in temporal lobe epilepsy.[12]",
    "Causes": "It is unknown as to what causes abdominal epilepsy. While a causal relationship between seizure activity and the GI symptoms has not been proven, the GI symptoms cannot be explained by other pathophysiological mechanisms, and are seen to improve upon anticonvulsant treatment. Because the condition is so rare, no high-quality studies exist. There have been too few reported cases to identify risk factors, genetic factors, or other potential causes.[10]",
    "Diagnosis": "Criteria for diagnosis of abdominal epilepsy includes frequent periodic abdominal symptoms, an abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) and significant improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms after taking anti-seizure medication. Medical testing for diagnosis can be completed using MRI scans of the brain, CT scans and ultrasounds of the abdomen, endoscopy of the gastrointestinal tract, and blood tests.[10]\nTypically, the diagnostic process begins with gathering information regarding the presence of common symptoms like paroxysmal abdominal pain and other gastrointestinal issues. Symptoms that persist continuously or for prolonged periods are less likely to indicate abdominal epilepsy. It's important to consider convulsions, alterations in consciousness, and other neurological symptoms alongside gastrointestinal symptoms when diagnosing abdominal epilepsy. Though, every episode of it may not be accompanied by a neurological symptom. This often makes these neurological symptoms unnoticeable for the patient.[11]\nThis is followed by the necessary evaluation that comprises neurological and physical examination, laboratory test, abdominal imaging using CT and ultrasound, endoscopy. Next if the above are normal but the history still suggests for this syndrome an EEG must be performed. EEG findings alone cannot distinguish between the kinds of epilepsy. Moreover, an EEG report could be normal if an event is not accompanied by neurological symptoms. If it is doubtable, a neurologist should be consulted.[11]",
    "Treatment": "Like other forms of epilepsy, abdominal epilepsy is treated with anticonvulsant drugs, such as phenytoin. Based on the clinical response additional medication may be used for complementing it or it could be used instead of phenytoin. Since no controlled studies exist, however, other drugs may be equally effective.[10] Anticonvulsants target non-epileptic causes of abdominal pain via sedative mechanisms. It may also act just as a placebo. The prognosis is generally good and most patients are benefitted from medicines alone.[13]"

    "Disease": "Abetalipoproteinemia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Initial symptoms usually appear in infancy,[5][6] including:\nThe rate of occurrence of additional symptoms later in life varies and increases with age.[6] These may include:",
    "Diagnosis": "The initial workup of Abetalipoproteinemia typically consists of stool sampling, a peripheral blood smear, and a fasting lipid panel, though these tests are not confirmatory.[19] As the disease is rare, though a genetics test is necessary for diagnosis, it is generally not done initially. However, prenatal testing may be available for pregnancies identified to be at an increased risk (if both parents are unaffected carrier or one parent is affected and the other in a carrier).{[20]}\nAcanthocytes are seen on blood smear.[21] Since there is no or little assimilation of chylomicrons, their levels in plasma remains low.[citation needed]\nThe inability to absorb fat in the ileum will result in steatorrhea, or fat in the stool.  As a result, this can be clinically diagnosed when foul-smelling stool is encountered.  Low levels of plasma chylomicron are also characteristic.[citation needed]\nThere is an absence of apolipoprotein B. On intestinal biopsy, vacuoles containing lipids are seen in enterocytes. This disorder may also result in fat accumulation in the liver (hepatic steatosis). Because the epithelial cells of the bowel lack the ability to place fats into chylomicrons, lipids accumulate at the surface of the cell, crowding the functions that are necessary for proper absorption.[citation needed]\nMultiple related disorders present with similar symptoms as abetalipoproteinemia that can provide a useful diagnosis through comparisons. Some of those disorders are:[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment normally consists of rigorous dieting, involving massive amounts of vitamin E.[12] High-dose Vitamin E therapy helps the body restore and produce lipoproteins, which people with abetalipoproteinemia usually lack. Vitamin E also helps keep skin and eyes healthy; studies show that many affected males will have vision problems later on in life. Common additional supplementation includes medium chain fatty acids and linoleic acid. Treatments also aim to slow the progression of nervous system abnormalities. Developmental coordination disorder and muscle weakness are usually treated with physiotherapy or occupational therapy. Dietary restriction of triglycerides has also been useful. Nutritionists often work with medical professionals to design appropriate dietary treatments for their patients.[2]",
    "Prognosis": "Prognosis can vary heavily based on the severity of the neurological dysfunction. If treatment is initiated early in disease the neurologic sequelae may be reversed and further deterioration can be prevented.[22] Long-term outlook is reasonably good for most people when diagnosed and treated early. A case study presented a female patient diagnosed at the age of 11. Despite the relatively late diagnosis, the patient married and at the age of 34, gave birth to a full-term healthy infant. Her medication included vitamin K 10 mg twice a week, beta-carotene 40,000 IU daily, vitamin A 10,000 IU daily, vitamin E 400 IU daily, vitamins B6 and B12, calcium, magnesium and eye drops.[23]\nProlonged vitamin deficiencies can further compromise health. Specifically, a prolonged vitamin E deficiency can lead to the development of limiting ataxia and gait disturbances. Some individuals may develop retinal degeneration and blindness. If left untreated, the condition may lead to death.'[2]"

    "Disease": "Achondroplasia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Children with achondroplasia often have less muscle tone; because of this it is common for them to have delayed walking and motor skills. It is also common for children to have bowed legs, scoliosis, lordosis, arthritis, issues with joint flexibility, breathing problems, ear infections, and crowded teeth.[12] These issues can be treated with surgery, braces, or physical therapy.[13]\nHydrocephalus is a severe effect associated with achondroplasia in children. This condition occurs when cerebrospinal fluid is not able to flow in and out of the skull because of how the spine narrows.[14] This fluid build up is associated with an enlarged head, vomiting, lethargy, headaches, and irritability.[15] A shunt surgery is commonly performed to treat this condition, but an endoscopic third ventriculostomy can also be done.[16]\nAdults with achondroplasia often face issues with obesity and sleep apnea. It is also typical for adults to experience numbness or tingling in their legs because of nerve compression.[citation needed]\nSome research has found that adults with achondroplasia may also experience psychosocial complications, usually associated with short stature.[7][17]\nPregnancy in women with achondroplasia is considered higher risk. Women with achondroplasia generally have their babies delivered through C-sections to prevent complications that could occur with a natural birth.[18] Intelligence and life span are usually near normal, although craniocervical junction compression increases the risk of death in infancy.[19]",
    "Causes": "Achondroplasia is caused by a mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene.[20] This gene encodes a protein called fibroblast growth factor receptor 3, which contributes to the production of collagen and other structural components in tissues and bones.[21] When the FGFR3 gene is mutated it interferes with how this protein interacts with growth factors leading to complications with bone production. Cartilage is not able to fully develop into bone, causing the individual to be disproportionately shorter in height.[22]\nIn normal development, FGFR3 has a negative regulatory effect on bone growth. In achondroplasia, the mutated form of the receptor is constitutively active, and this leads to severely shortened bones. This is an example of a gain of function mutation. The effect is genetically dominant, with one variant of the FGFR3 gene being sufficient to cause achondroplasia, while two copies of the mutant gene are invariably fatal (recessive lethal) before or shortly after birth. This occurs due to respiratory failure from an underdeveloped ribcage.[3] People with achondroplasia are often born to parents that do not have the condition due to spontaneous mutation.[23]\nWhere achondroplasia is inherited, its pattern is autosomal dominant. In couples where one partner has achondroplasia there is a 50% chance of passing the disorder on to their child every pregnancy. In situations where both parents have achondroplasia there is a 50% chance the child will have achondroplasia, 25% chance the child will not, and a 25% chance that the child will inherit the gene from both parents resulting in double dominance and leading to lethal bone dysplasia.[24]\nStudies have demonstrated that new gene mutations for achondroplasia are exclusively inherited from the father and occur during spermatogenesis; it has been theorized that sperm carrying the mutation in FGFR3 have a selective advantage over sperm with normal FGFR3.[4] The frequency of mutations in sperm leading to achondroplasia increases in proportion to paternal age, as well as in proportion to exposure to ionizing radiation.[25] The occurrence rate of achondroplasia in the children of fathers over 50 years of age is 1 in 1,875, compared to 1 in 15,000 in the general population.[26] Research by urologist Harry Fisch of the Male Reproductive Center at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in 2013 indicated that in humans this defect may be exclusively inherited from the father and becomes increasingly probable with paternal age, specifically males reproducing after 35.[27]\nThere are two other syndromes with a genetic basis similar to achondroplasia: hypochondroplasia and thanatophoric dysplasia.",
    "Diagnosis": "Achondroplasia can be detected before birth by prenatal ultrasound, although signs are often subtle and not apparent before the 24th week of pregnancy.[28] A DNA test can be performed before birth to detect homozygosity, wherein two copies of the mutant gene are inherited, a lethal condition leading to stillbirths. Postnatal diagnosis of achondroplasia is typically uncomplicated, involving an assessment of physical and radiographic features.[29]  Clinical features include megalocephaly, short limbs, prominent forehead, thoracolumbar kyphosis and mid-face hypoplasia.[30] Complications like dental malocclusion, hydrocephalus and repeated otitis media can be observed.[30] The risk of death in infancy is increased due to the likelihood of compression of the spinal cord with or without upper airway obstruction.[citation needed]\nA skeletal survey is useful to confirm the diagnosis of achondroplasia. The skull is large, with a narrow foramen magnum, and relatively small skull base. The vertebral bodies are short and flattened with relatively large intervertebral disk height, and there is congenitally narrowed spinal canal. The iliac wings are small and squared, with a narrow sciatic notch and horizontal acetabular roof.[31][32] The tubular bones are short and thick with metaphyseal cupping and flaring and irregular growth plates.[31] Fibular overgrowth is present. The hand is broad with short metacarpals and phalanges, and a trident configuration. The ribs are short with cupped anterior ends.[31] If the radiographic features are not classic, a search for a different diagnosis should be entertained. Because of the extremely deformed bone structure, people with achondroplasia are often \"double jointed\". The diagnosis can be made by fetal ultrasound by progressive discordance between the short femur length and biparietal diameter by age. The trident hand configuration can be seen if the fingers are fully extended.[citation needed]\nAnother common characteristic of the syndrome is thoracolumbar gibbus in infancy.[33]",
    "Treatment": "There is no known cure for achondroplasia even though the cause of the mutation in the growth factor receptor has been found. Although used by those without achondroplasia to aid in growth, human growth hormone does not help people with achondroplasia, which involves a different hormonal pathway. Usually, the best results appear within the first and second year of therapy.[34] After the second year of growth hormone therapy, beneficial bone growth decreases,[35] so the therapy is not a satisfactory long-term treatment.[34] As of December 2020, the treatment of achondroplasia with human growth hormone was approved only in Japan.[36]\nA small-molecule drug vosoritide is used to improve growth velocity in children with achondroplasia,[10] although its long-term effects are unknown. Vosoritide inhibits the activity of FGFR3.[37] It has been gradually made available in different countries starting from 2021.\nLimb-lengthening will increase the length of the legs and arms of someone with achondroplasia,[38]  but little medical consensus exists regarding this practice. The age of surgery can vary from early childhood to adulthood.[39]\nResearch has also shown that introducing parents of children with achondroplasia to support and advocacy groups at the time of diagnosis can improve outcomes.[40] Several patient advocacy groups exist to support people with achondroplasia and their families.[41] Resources are available to support patients and their caregivers with information that they can distribute to their physicians, who may not be familiar with the unique medical requirements of managing achondroplasia. Physician-oriented best practice guidelines are also available to guide physicians managing the spinal disorders,[42] foramen magnum stenosis,[6] craniofacial implications,[43] pregnancy,[44] and peri-operative[45] needs of people with achondroplasia.\nHomozygous achondroplasia is invariably considered terminal even with aggressive treatment.",
    "Epidemiology": "Achondroplasia is one of several congenital conditions with similar presentations, such as osteogenesis imperfecta, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia tarda, achondrogenesis, osteopetrosis, and thanatophoric dysplasia. This makes estimates of prevalence difficult, with changing and subjective diagnostic criteria over time. One detailed and long-running study in the Netherlands found that the prevalence determined at birth was only 1.3 per 100,000 live births.[46] Another study at the same time found a rate of 1 per 10,000.[46] A 2020 review and meta-analysis estimated a worldwide prevalence of 4.6 per 100,000.[47]"

    "Disease": "Achromatopsia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The five symptoms associated with achromatopsia are:[citation needed]\nThe syndrome is typically first noticed in children around six months of age due to their photophobia or their nystagmus. The nystagmus becomes less noticeable with age but the other symptoms of the syndrome become more relevant as school age approaches. Visual acuity and stability of the eye motions generally improve during the first six to seven years of life – but remain near 20/200. Otherwise the syndrome is considered stationary and does not worsen with age.[citation needed]\nIf the light level during testing is optimized, achromats may achieve corrected visual acuity of 20/100 to 20/150 at lower light levels, regardless of the absence of color.[citation needed] The fundus of the eye appears completely normal.[citation needed]\nAchromatopsia can be classified as complete or incomplete. In general, symptoms of incomplete achromatopsia are attenuated versions of those of complete achromatopsia. Individuals with incomplete achromatopsia have reduced visual acuity with or without nystagmus or photophobia. Incomplete achromats show only partial impairment of cone cell function.[citation needed]",
    "Causes": "Achromatopsia is sometimes called rod monochromacy (as opposed to blue cone monochromacy), as achromats exhibit a complete absence of cone cell activity via electroretinography in photopic lighting. There are multiple genetic causes of achromatopsia, including mutations in:",
    "Treatment": "As achromatopsia is linked to only a few single-gene mutations, it is a good candidate for gene therapy. Gene therapy is a technique for injecting functional genes into the cells that need them, replacing or overruling the original alleles linked to achromatopsia, thereby curing it – at least in part. Achromatopsia has been a focus of gene therapy since 2010, when achromatopsia in dogs was partially cured. Several clinical trials on humans are ongoing with mixed results.[11] In July 2023, a study found positive but limited improvements on congenital CNGA3 achromatopsia.[12][13]",
    "Epidemiology": "Achromatopsia is a relatively uncommon disorder, with a prevalence of 1 in 30,000 people.[18]\nHowever, on the small Micronesian atoll of Pingelap, approximately five percent of the atoll's 3,000 inhabitants are affected.[19][20] This is the result of a population bottleneck caused by a typhoon and ensuing famine in the 1770s, which killed all but about twenty islanders, including one who was heterozygous for achromatopsia.[21]\nThe people of this region have termed achromatopsia \"maskun\", which literally means \"not see\" in Pingelapese.[22] This unusual population drew neurologist Oliver Sacks to the island for which he wrote his 1997 book, The Island of the Colorblind.[23]"

    "Disease": "Acrocephalosyndactyly",
    "Causes": "Most forms of acrocephalosyndactyly or acrocephalopolysyndactyly are inherited in autosomal dominant pattern,[15][20][1] with the exclusion of Carpenter Syndrome which is inherited in autosomal recessive manner. De-novo variants, or genetic alterations not inherited from one's parents, in different genes were reported to cause several types of acrocephalosyndactyly. Among known genetic changes, there are variations in genes such as Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR),[16][17][21][22] TWIST1,[23]  and RAB23.[24]  Constitutive activation in these categories of genes, particularly FGFR, which is heavily involved during the development stage of embryos such as organ development or organogenesis and the maintenance of tissue forming cells, known as progenitor cells, can be very detrimental.[25]\nGenetically inherited acrocephalosyndactyly conditions all show high to complete penetrance with a variable expression, meaning that all individuals who inherit the condition present atypical characteristic craniofacial, hand, and foot structures, but the severity of disabilities is variable.[1] Increased paternal age is considered a risk factor in some cases.[1]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis prior to birth is possible for some forms of acrocephalosyndactyly. Prenatal genetic diagnosis is only possible if the gene variation responsible for the syndrome is known and the variation causing the disease has been identified within the genome of a family member. Collection of samples for genetic testing can be done using amniocentesis,  which samples embryonic stem cells contained in amniotic fluid, or chorionic villus sampling, which samples placental cells.[15] There has been a case of a prenatal diagnosis of Apert syndrome using fetoscopy, where the fetus is observed using an endoscope inserted into the uterus from the abdomen.[22]  Alternatively, there has been interest in using non-invasive techniques like ultrasound to detect atypical fetal skull features.[28]\nMost diagnoses of acrocephalosyndactyly occur after birth by assessing the physical symptoms of the infant. This can be supported with radiographic imaging, such as X-ray imaging, and molecular genetic testing, which looks for DNA variations known to cause the disease.[29][30] Molecular genetic testing typically occurs in the FGFR, TWIST1, and RAB23 genes.\nThere is no consistent nomenclature or classification across the different syndromes under the umbrella of acrocephalosyndactyly and acrocephalopolysyndactyly. Although acrocephalosyndactyly has been reported as early as the 18th century,[9] the ACS and ACPS classifications only came in the latter 20th century. However, this classification may be outdated as it has been suggested that the distinction between acrocephalosyndactyly and acrocephalopolysyndactyly should be erased.[5]\nCurrently, Noack syndrome (ACPS type I) is now classified as Pfeiffer syndrome (ACS type V);[31] Goodman syndrome (ACPS type IV) is classified as a variation of Carpenter syndrome (ACPS type II);[19] and different researchers have combined Apert (ASC type I), Crouzon (ASC type II), and Pfeiffer (ASC type V) syndrome into Apert-Crouzon[32] and Crouzon-Pfeiffer[33] syndrome.\nAcrocephalosyndactyly type IV was formerly called Mohr Syndrome, however, it was later classified under Orofaciodigital syndrome type II.[34] Pfeiffer syndrome was formerly type VI and Waardenburg type V, but this was changed sometime after 1966.[35]\nAcrocephalosyndactyly (ACS):",
    "Treatment": "For subtypes with craniosynostosis, surgery is required to prevent premature fusion of cranial sutures, such as the coronal suture (brachycephaly).[7] The cranial suture located between the two frontal and two parietal skull bones is called the coronal suture.[2] Cranioplasty should be performed in the first year of life to prevent disruptions in brain growth due to increased intracranial pressure. Midface surgery may also be required in childhood to detach the midface from the rest of the skull to correct respiratory and orthodontic problems.[43][44]\nSyndactyly in certain subtypes is rarely severe enough to affect hand function, so treatment may not be needed.[43]\nIn more severe subtypes, as seen in Apert syndrome, surgical correction of syndactyly may be needed. Surgery is recommended to be performed as soon as possible, generally at 4 months of age. Treatment is dependent on the severity of syndactyly. The surgical treatment generally involves interdigital webspace release and thumb lengthening.[8]\nTreatment for those diagnosed with acrocephalosyndactyly extends beyond surgery. There are many steps that can aid in long-term management of the syndrome. Individuals afflicted with acrocephalosyndactyly and their caregivers can build a health care support system by building strong relationships with a team of medical specialists. Preformed teams of medical specialists can often be found at universities or research institutions. Caregivers can prevent future challenges by exploring options for financial aid, health insurance, and accommodating educational institutions. Primary caregivers are encouraged to prioritize their emotional health by reserving time for themselves and by sourcing a reliable support system.[29]",
    "Epidemiology": "Considering all types of acrocephalosyndactyly, one newborn baby is born with acrocephalosyndactyly for every 65,000 - 102,500 babies born. There is no difference in the amount of males and females affected by acrocephalosyndactyly.[12][13][14][15]"

    "Disease": "Acromesomelic dysplasia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Acromesomelic dysplasia (AMD) is characterized by the inhibition of growth of certain long bones such as the forearms and lower legs.[3] This disease typically becomes apparent during the first years of life.[3] Forearms, lower legs, hands and feet do not grow proportionally with the rest of the body.[4] Over time, individuals can have a hard time fully extending their arms, rotating the arms inwards towards the body with palms facing down and rotating the arms outward with the palms facing upward.[4] Abnormalities of cartilage and bone development may also cause the bones within the fingers, toes, hands and feet to become sufficiently shorter and broader.[4] During early childhood, individuals may experience progressive, abnormal curvature of the spine.[4] Common symptoms include:\nInfants with AMD typically have a normal birth weight, but can have other characteristic facial abnormalities.[3]",
    "Causes": "AMD is extremely rare and is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic trait.[3] Autosomal recessive means that two copies of an abnormal gene must be present in order for the disease to develop.[5] This can be inherited from the parents or the gene can mutate in the person who has AMD.[3]\nGenetic studies indicate that the mutation at chromosome 9p13-12, for AMD Maroteaux, is a gene that codes for a protein that affects bone development, natriuretic peptide receptor B (Npr2).[3][6] This is a receptor for the hormone C-type natriuretic peptide which is a hormone that is essential for bone growth.[3][6] AMD Grebe dysplasia has a gene located at chromosome 20q11.2[3][7] This chromosome codes for a protein known as growth and development factor-5 (GDF5).[3][6] AMD with genital anomalies has a gene located at chromosome 4q23-24; this codes for a protein known as a bone morphogenetic protein receptor, type 1B.[3][8]Genetic diseases are determined by the combination of genes for a certain trait that is on the chromosomes received from the mother and father.[3]\nDominant genetic disorders happen when a single copy of an abnormal gene is needed to cause a certain disease.[3] The abnormal gene can be inherited from either parent or result from a gene mutation.[3]",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is based on a clinical presentation, molecular analysis, electropherogram and radiograph.[9][3] This disease is diagnosed within the first few years of life.[3] Identification of the main characteristics is the key factor in diagnosis. Molecular analysis is used to examine the DNA of the affected person and their parents.[9] For this, a blood sample is needed and the DNA will be extracted with an automatic DNA extractor.[9] The results will show the mutated chromosome and identify if this chromosome was passed on from a parent.[9] A radiograph will show abnormal growth plates and misshapen bones in the limbs.[6][3][9] This can confirm the abnormal development and premature fusion of the regions where the diaphyses, of certain long bones, meet their epiphyses.[3] Electropherogram is used to identify genotyping.[citation needed] These results can be used to compare to a normal sequence and relatives sequences.[10]\nIt is important to have a detailed patient history, including the parents or other relatives.[3] Typically, the parent that carries the chromosome for AMD, seems to be shorter than average.[6][11] Monitoring the weight and height of the person affected with AMD is important.[10] Based on the person's age, they should be meeting a certain percentile to identify any issues that may be causing a stunt in growth.[3]\nThere are five types of AMD:[3]\nOsebold-Remondini causes shortness of limbs and hypoplasia of the second phalanges with fusion to the remaining phalanges, carpal and tarsal coalitions.[12] Maroteaux type causes severe dwarfism with a height below 120 cm.[6] This type also causes shortening of the middle and distal segments of the limbs.[6] Grebe dysplasia causes extreme abnormalities of the limb joints and limbs.[7] In this type of AMD, the hands and feet are affected the most.[7] This type primarily affects the joints in the hands and feet causing a lack of articulation.[7] Grebe dysplasia does not have any major effects on the stature.[7] Du Pan syndrome causes underdevelopment of the tissues in the fibulae, feet and hands.[13] Acromesomelic dysplasia with genital anomalies causes shortness of limbs and stature with congenital malformations of the female genital tract and male reproductive system.[8]\nAll five types of AMD are caused by a gene mutation or receiving it from their parents.[3] The differences between the types are the different genes that are affected. The mutated gene for each type is listed in the pathophysiology section.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "There are a few treatment plans for AMD and each person's results vary. Depending on the type of AMD and the symptoms the person has, their therapy may differ.[3] Physical therapy is aimed to help specific symptoms.[3] For example, abnormal curvature of the spine may be treated by exercises, braces, casts and in severe cases, corrective surgery.[3] It is important to start physical therapy as early as possible to ensure that people with AMD can reach their full potential.[3]\nOne treatment that can help a person who is affected with AMD is recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH).[3][14][15][10] Recombinant human growth hormones are produced in the pituitary gland and can help spur growth in children and adolescents.[16] It is used in AMD patients to help muscle and bone growth.[14][15][10][16] This treatment is long-term and will not cure this disease, it will only help the patient grow a couple of centimeters.[15][14][10] A case study showed a growth velocity of 3.6-4.2 cm/year during this first year of treatment.[14] As well as height improving from 1.2 to 1.8 SD over 5 years of treatment.[14] Another case study was conducted that showed within a year, a patient had an increase of 7.0 cm/year.[15] With this treatment, it is important to start it during the puberty stage.[15][10] Some patients that have received this treatment, have seen no difference or increase in height.[10] There is no prevention with AMD and not many options for managing the symptoms.[citation needed]\nKyphosis is an excessive outward curvature of the spine resulting in a hunch back.[17] Treatment for this disease includes taking pain relievers and osteoporosis medications.[17] Medication for osteoporosis helps strengthen the bones to help prevent any spinal fractures.[17] Lumbar hyperlordosis is a condition that occurs when the lower back region experiences stress or extra weight.[citation needed] This causes the lower back to become arched and creates muscle spasms or pain.[citation needed] Treatment focuses on stretching the lower back, quads, hip flexors and strengthening the hamstrings, glutes and abdominal muscles.[citation needed] Braces may be used to help relieve some stress or pressure on the lower back.[citation needed]\nRisk factors from taking rhGH include:[16]\nOther risk factors that increase the risk of having AMD include a family history of having this condition or a child born from parents who are close blood relatives.[18]",
    "Prognosis": "A person diagnosed with AMD will have a normal life expectancy.[19] With this disease, there are no chances of full recovery; it is something that the person will have for their entire life.[4] Abnormal cartilage and bone development can affect many bones in the body.[4] Long term effects include joint pain, arthritis, abnormal curvature of the spine and short stature of limbs and height.[3][4]",
    "Epidemiology": "The prevalence of AMD is <1/1000000.[20] Nearly ten million people in the world carry the NPR2 mutated gene (Maroteaux type); only 3500 people in the entire world are affected with AMD.[19] AMD is rare and there are less than 100 reported cases.[18] AMD can be classified as skeletal dysplasia, which approximately occurs in 1 out of 5000 births.[21] This disease affects both males and females as well as any racial or ethnic group.[18] The majority of the case studies involve patients that live in Pakistan, Morocco, or Karnataka.[10][9][22][23] AMD does primarily begin in the first few years of life or as early as the neonatal phase, but it can affect anyone at any age.[3][18]\nThe earliest known case of AMD occurred in the late Upper Paleolithic.[24][25] While AMD would have significantly interfered with the ability to live a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, the individual in question lived until late adolescence, suggesting that they were cared for by the group.[24]"

    "Disease": "Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "ADEM has an abrupt onset and a monophasic course. Symptoms usually begin 1–3 weeks after infection. Major symptoms include fever, headache, nausea and vomiting, confusion, vision impairment, drowsiness, seizures and coma. Although initially the symptoms are usually mild, they worsen rapidly over the course of hours to days, with the average time to maximum severity being about four and a half days.[20] Additional symptoms include hemiparesis, paraparesis, and cranial nerve palsies.[21]\nNeurological symptoms were the main presentation of COVID-19, which did not correlate with the severity of respiratory symptoms. The high incidence of ADEM with hemorrhage is striking. Brain inflammation is likely caused by an immune response to the disease rather than neurotropism. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was not indicative of an infectious process, neurological impairment was not present in the acute phase of the infection, and neuroimaging findings were not typical of classical toxic and metabolic disorders. The finding of bilateral periventricular relatively asymmetrical lesions allied with deep white matter involvement, that may also be present in cortical gray-white matter junction, thalami, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and brainstem suggests an acute demyelination process.[22] Additionally, hemorrhagic white matter lesions, clusters of macrophages related to axonal injury and ADEM-like appearance were also found in subcortical white matter.[23]",
    "Causes": "Since the discovery of the anti-MOG specificity against multiple sclerosis diagnosis[24] it is considered that ADEM is one of the possible clinical causes of anti-MOG associated encephalomyelitis.[25]\nThere are several theories about how the anti-MOG antibodies appear in the patient's serum:",
    "Diagnosis": "The term ADEM has been inconsistently used at different times.[45] Currently, the commonly accepted international standard for the clinical case definition is the one published by the International Pediatric MS Study Group, revision 2007.[46]\nGiven that the definition is clinical, it is currently unknown if all the cases of ADEM are positive for anti-MOG autoantibody; in any case, it appears to be strongly related to ADEM diagnosis.[25]\nWhile ADEM and MS both involve autoimmune demyelination, they differ in many clinical, genetic, imaging, and histopathological aspects.[14][47] Some authors consider MS and its borderline forms to constitute a spectrum, differing only in chronicity, severity, and clinical course,[48][49] while others consider them discretely different diseases.[6]\nTypically, ADEM appears in children following an antigenic challenge and remains monophasic. Nevertheless, ADEM does occur in adults,[8][12] and can also be clinically multiphasic.[50]\nProblems for differential diagnosis increase due to the lack of agreement for a definition of multiple sclerosis.[51] If MS were defined only by the separation in time and space of the demyelinating lesions as McDonald did,[52] it would not be enough to make a difference, as some cases of ADEM satisfy these conditions. Therefore, some authors propose to establish the dividing line as the shape of the lesions around the veins, being therefore \"perivenous vs. confluent demyelination\".[51][53]\nThe pathology of ADEM is very similar to that of MS with some differences. The pathological hallmark of ADEM is perivenous inflammation with limited \"sleeves of demyelination\".[54][14] Nevertheless, MS-like plaques (confluent demyelination) can appear[55]\nPlaques in the white matter in MS are sharply delineated, while the glial scar in ADEM is smooth. Axons are better preserved in ADEM lesions. Inflammation in ADEM is widely disseminated and ill-defined, and finally, lesions are strictly perivenous, while in MS they are disposed around veins, but not so sharply.[56]\nNevertheless, the co-occurrence of perivenous and confluent demyelination in some individuals suggests pathogenic overlap between acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis and misclassification even with biopsy[53] or even postmortem[55]  ADEM in adults can progress to MS[12]\nWhen the person has more than one demyelinating episode of ADEM, the disease is then called recurrent disseminated encephalomyelitis or multiphasic disseminated encephalomyelitis[18] (MDEM).\nIt has been found that anti-MOG auto-antibodies are related to this kind of ADEM[57]\nAnother variant of ADEM in adults has been described, also related to anti-MOG auto-antibodies, has been named fulminant disseminated encephalomyelitis, and it has been reported to be clinically ADEM, but showing MS-like lesions on autopsy.[19] It has been classified inside the anti-MOG associated inflammatory demyelinating diseases.[58]\nAcute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (AHL, or AHLE), acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis (AHEM), acute necrotizing hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (ANHLE), Weston-Hurst syndrome, or Hurst's disease, is a hyperacute and frequently fatal form of ADEM. AHL is relatively rare (less than 100 cases have been reported in the medical literature as of 2006[update]),[59] it is seen in about 2% of ADEM cases,[20] and is characterized by necrotizing vasculitis of venules and hemorrhage, and edema.[60] Death is common in the first week[61] and overall mortality is about 70%,[59] but increasing evidence points to favorable outcomes after aggressive treatment with corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, cyclophosphamide, and plasma exchange.[29] About 70% of survivors show residual neurological deficits,[60] but some survivors have shown surprisingly little deficit considering the extent of the white matter affected.[61]\nThis disease has been occasionally associated with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, malaria,[62] sepsis associated with immune complex deposition, methanol poisoning, and other underlying conditions. Also anecdotal association with MS has been reported[63]\nLaboratory studies that support diagnosis of AHL are: peripheral leukocytosis, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis associated with normal glucose and increased protein. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), lesions of AHL typically show extensive T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) white matter hyperintensities with areas of hemorrhages, significant edema, and mass effect.[64]",
    "Treatment": "No controlled clinical trials have been conducted on ADEM treatment, but aggressive treatment aimed at rapidly reducing inflammation of the CNS is standard. The widely accepted first-line treatment is high doses of intravenous corticosteroids,[65] such as methylprednisolone or dexamethasone, followed by 3–6 weeks of gradually lower oral doses of prednisolone. Patients treated with methylprednisolone have shown better outcomes than those treated with dexamethasone.[20] Oral tapers of less than three weeks duration show a higher chance of relapsing,[11][18] and tend to show poorer outcomes.[citation needed] Other anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapies have been reported to show beneficial effect, such as plasmapheresis, high doses of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg),[65][66] mitoxantrone and cyclophosphamide. These are considered alternative therapies, used when corticosteroids cannot be used or fail to show an effect.[citation needed]\nThere is some evidence to suggest that patients may respond to a combination of methylprednisolone and immunoglobulins if they fail to respond to either separately[67]\nIn a study of 16 children with ADEM, 10 recovered completely after high-dose methylprednisolone, one severe case that failed to respond to steroids recovered completely after IV Ig; the five most severe cases – with ADAM and severe peripheral neuropathy – were treated with combined high-dose methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin, two remained paraplegic, one had motor and cognitive handicaps, and two recovered.[65] A recent review of IVIg treatment of ADEM (of which the previous study formed the bulk of the cases) found that 70% of children showed complete recovery after treatment with IVIg, or IVIg plus corticosteroids.[68] A study of IVIg treatment in adults with ADEM showed that IVIg seems more effective in treating sensory and motor disturbances, while steroids seem more effective in treating impairments of cognition, consciousness and rigor.[66] This same study found one subject, a 71-year-old man who had not responded to steroids, that responded to an IVIg treatment 58 days after disease onset.[citation needed]",
    "Prognosis": "Full recovery is seen in 50 to 70% of cases, ranging to 70 to 90% recovery with some minor residual disability (typically assessed using measures such as mRS or EDSS), average time to recover is one to six months.[15] The mortality rate may be as high as 5–10%.[15][69] Poorer outcomes are associated with unresponsiveness to steroid therapy, unusually severe neurological symptoms, or sudden onset. Children tend to have more favorable outcomes than adults, and cases presenting without fevers tend to have poorer outcomes. The latter effect may be due to either protective effects of fever, or that diagnosis and treatment is sought more rapidly when fever is present.[70]\nADEM can progress to MS. It will be considered MS if some lesions appear in different times and brain areas[71]\nResidual motor deficits are estimated to remain in about 8 to 30% of cases, the range in severity from mild clumsiness to ataxia and hemiparesis.[29]\nPatients with demyelinating illnesses, such as MS, have shown cognitive deficits even when there is minimal physical disability.[72] Research suggests that similar effects are seen after ADEM, but that the deficits are less severe than those seen in MS. A study of six children with ADEM (mean age at presentation 7.7 years) were tested for a range of neurocognitive tests after an average of 3.5 years of recovery.[73] All six children performed in the normal range on most tests, including verbal IQ and performance IQ, but performed at least one standard deviation below age norms in at least one cognitive domain, such as complex attention (one child), short-term memory (one child) and internalizing behaviour/affect (two children). Group means for each cognitive domain were all within one standard deviation of age norms, demonstrating that, as a group, they were normal. These deficits were less severe than those seen in similar aged children with a diagnosis of MS.[74]\nAnother study compared nineteen children with a history of ADEM, of which 10 were five years of age or younger at the time (average age 3.8 years old, tested an average of 3.9 years later) and nine were older (mean age 7.7y at time of ADEM, tested an average of 2.2 years later) to nineteen matched controls.[75] Scores on IQ tests and educational achievement were lower for the young onset ADEM group (average IQ 90) compared to the late onset (average IQ 100) and control groups (average IQ 106), while the late onset ADEM children scored lower on verbal processing speed. Again, all groups means were within one standard deviation of the controls, meaning that while effects were statistically reliable, the children were as a whole, still within the normal range. There were also more behavioural problems in the early onset group, although there is some suggestion that this may be due, at least in part, to the stress of hospitalization at a young age.[76][77]"

    "Causes": "Though exact etiology of AIBSE syndrome is unknown, studies shows that viral illness like influenza and vaccinations like MMR may trigger the condition.[3]",

    "Disease": "Adenosine monophosphate deaminase deficiency type 1",
    "Signs and symptoms": "For reasons that are not understood, many people with defective variants of the AMPD genes are asymptomatic, while others have symptoms including exercise intolerance, and/or muscle pain and cramping.[1]\nThere is an increased risk that statin (cholesterol-reducing drugs) will cause myopathy (muscle weakness) in individuals with MADD.[10]\nAnesthesia has the potential to cause malignant hyperthermia, an uncontrolled increase in body temperature, and permanent muscle damage in patients with MADD. Individuals with MADD are advised to notify their anesthesiologist about their condition prior to surgery.[6]\nIn most cases where myopathy is present with MADD, a second muscle disease is present and symptoms are worse than either disease in isolation.[11][12]",
    "Causes": "AMP deaminase is an enzyme that converts adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to inosine monophosphate (IMP), freeing an ammonia molecule in the process. It is a part of the metabolic process that converts sugar, fat, and protein into cellular energy. In order to use energy, a cell converts one of the above fuels into adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via the mitochondria. Cellular processes, especially muscles, then convert the ATP into adenosine diphosphate (ADP), freeing the energy to do work.[citation needed]\nDuring heavy or prolonged mild to moderate activity, other enzymes convert two molecules of ADP into one ATP molecule and one AMP molecule, making more ATP available to supply energy. AMP is normally converted into IMP by myoadenylate deaminase—so myoadenylate deaminase deficiency reduces energy that would be available to the cell through the purine nucleotide cycle. Instead of being converted to IMP, the AMP builds up in the cells of affected individuals, spills into the blood, and is eventually metabolized in the liver[citation needed]. In persons with a defective enzyme, 5'-nucleotidase removes the ribose and phosphorus from AMP, increasing levels of adenosine measured in muscle cells by ~16–25×, after exercise.[13][14]",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of MADD needs to be considered in patients who have exercise induced myalgia, cramps and sometimes weakness. A mildly elevated creatine kinase may also occur. Exclusion of other muscular diseases such as McArdle's Disease and carnitine cycle abnormalities should occur. MADD may be identified if there is a lack of ammonia rise after forearm exercise testing. The diagnosis may then be confirmed with genetic testing.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "It is important for MADD patients to maintain strength and fitness without exercising or working to exhaustion. Learning this balance may be more difficult than normally, as muscle pain and fatigue may be perceived differently from normal individuals.[19]\nSymptomatic relief from the effects of MADD may sometimes be achieved by administering ribose orally at a dose of approximately 10 grams per 100 pounds (0.2 g/kg) of body weight per day, and exercise modulation as appropriate. Taken hourly, ribose provides a direct but limited source of energy for the cells. Patients with myoadenylate deaminase deficiency do not retain ribose during heavy exercise, so supplementation may be required to rebuild levels of ATP.[20][21]\nCreatine monohydrate could also be helpful for AMPD patients, as it provides an alternative source of energy for anaerobic muscle tissue and was found to be helpful in the treatment of other, unrelated muscular myopathies.[22]"

    "Disease": "Adipsia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Diagnosing adipsia can be difficult as there is no set of concrete physical signs that are adipsia specific.  Changes in the brain that are indicative of adipsia include those of hyperpnea, muscle weakness, insomnia, lethargy, and convulsions (although uncommon except in extreme cases of incredibly rapid rehydration).  Patients with a history of brain tumors, or congenital malformations, may have hypothalamic lesions, which could be indicative of adipsia.[4] Some adults with Type A adipsia are anorexic in addition to the other symptoms.[11]",
    "Causes": "Dopamine, a neurotransmitter, has been linked with feeding behaviors. In an experiment, scientists measured how much food and water mice consumed when they were born without dopamine in their systems. They found that without dopamine, the mice would starve and be dehydrated to the point of death. The scientists then injected the mice without dopamine with its precursor, L-DOPA, and the mice started eating again. But, even though the mice were born without dopamine in their systems, they still had the capacity to control their feeding and drinking behaviors, suggesting that dopamine does not play a role in developing those neural circuits. Instead, dopamine is more closely related to the drive for hunger and thirst. Although the lack of dopamine resulted in adipsia in these rats, low levels of dopamine do not necessarily cause adipsia.\n[9]\nOther findings in support of the role of dopamine in thirst regulation involved the nigrostriatal pathway. After completely degenerating the pathway, the animal becomes adipsic, aphagic, and loses its interest in exploring. Although dopamine plays a role in adipsia, there is no research involving exclusively the relationship between adipsia and dopamine, as changes in dopamine simultaneously mediate changes in eating and curiosity, in addition to thirst.[10]\nAdipsia can tend to result from lesions to hypothalamic regions involved in thirst regulation.  These lesions can be congenital, acquired, trauma, or even surgery.  Lesions or injuries to those hypothalamic regions cause adipsia because the lesions cause defects in the thirst regulating center which can lead to adipsia. Lesions in that region can also cause adipsia because of the extremely close anatomical proximity of the hypothalamus to ADH-related osmoreceptors.[8]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosing adipsia can be difficult as there is no set of concrete physical signs that are adipsia specific.  Changes in the brain that are indicative of adipsia include those of hyperpnea, muscle weakness, insomnia, lethargy, and convulsions (although uncommon except in extreme cases of incredibly rapid rehydration).  Patients with a history of brain tumors, or congenital malformations, may have hypothalamic lesions, which could be indicative of adipsia.[4] Some adults with Type A adipsia are anorexic in addition to the other symptoms.[11]\nInitial testing for adipsia involves electrolyte, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, serum and urine osmolality, blood hormone levels, like vasopressin (AVP). In patients who have defects in thirst regulation and vasopressin secretion, serum vasopressin levels are low or absent.[12] Measurements of urine electrolytes and osmolality are critical in determining the central, rather than renal, nature of the defect in water homeostasis. In adipsia, the fractional excretion of sodium is less than 1%, unless a coexisting defect in AVP secretion is present. In salt intoxication, the urine sodium concentrations are very high and fractional excretion of sodium is greater than 1%. Initial test results may be suggestive of diabetes insipidus. The circulating AVP levels tend to be high, which indicate an appropriate response of the pituitary to hyperosmolality.  Patients may have mild stable elevations of serum sodium concentrations, along with elevations in both  BUN and creatinine levels and in the BUN/creatinine ratio.[4]\nType A (essential hypernatremia syndrome) involves an increase of the level in which solvent molecules can pass through cell membranes (osmotic threshold) for vasopressin release and the activation of the feeling of thirst. This is the most characterized sub-type of adipsia, however there is no known cause for Type A adipsia. There is debate over whether osmoreceptor resetting could lead to the increase in threshold. Other studies have shown that it is the loss of osmoreceptors, not resetting, that cause the change in threshold.[13] Patients with Type A adipsia can be at risk of seizures if they rapidly re-hydrate or quickly add a significant amount of sodium into their bodies. If not treated, Type A adipsia could result in both a decrease in the size of the brain and bleeding in the brain.[11]\nType B adipsia occurs when vasopressin responses are at decreased levels in the presence of osmotic stimuli. Although minimal, there is still some secretion of AVP. This type may be due to some elimination of osmoreceptors.[13]\nType C adipsia (type C osmoreceptor dysfunction) involves complete elimination of osmoreceptors, and as a result have no vasopressin release when there normally would be. Type C is generally the adipsia type found in patients with adipsic diabetes insipidus.[13]\nType D is the least commonly diagnosed and researched type of adipsia. The AVP release in this subtype occurs with normally functioning levels of osmoregulation.[13]",
    "Treatment": "People affected by adipsia lack the ability to feel thirst; thus, they often must be directed to drink. Adipsic persons may undergo training to learn when it is necessary that they drink water. Currently, there is no medicine available to treat adipsia. For people with adipsia because of hypothalamic damage, there is no surgical or medicinal option to fix the damage. In some cases where adipsia was caused by growths on thirst centers in the brain, surgical removal of the growths was successful in treating adipsia. Although adipsic persons must maintain a strict water intake schedule, their diets and participation in physical activities are not limited.\nPeople affected by diabetes insipidus have the option of using the intranasal or oral hormone desmopressin acetate (DDAVP), which is molecularly similar enough to vasopressin to perform its function. In this case, desmopressin helps the kidneys to promote reabsorption of water.[4] Some doctors have reported success in treating psychogenic adipsic patients with electroconvulsive therapy, although the results are mixed and the reason for its success is still unknown.[8] Additionally, some patients who do not successfully complete behavioral therapy may require a nasogastric tube in order to maintain healthy levels of fluids.[8]"

    "Disease": "Adrenoleukodystrophy",
    "Signs and symptoms": "ALD can present in different ways. The different presentations are complicated by the pattern of X-linked recessive inheritance. There have been seven phenotypes described in males with ABCD1 mutations and five in females.[4]  Initial symptoms in boys affected with the childhood cerebral form of ALD include emotional instability, hyperactivity and disruptive behavior at school. Older patients affected with the cerebral form will present with similar symptoms.  Untreated, cerebral ALD is characterized by progressive demyelination leading to a vegetative state and death.[5]  Adult males with an adrenomyeloneuropathy presentation typically present initially with muscle stiffness, paraparesis and sexual dysfunction.[6]  All patients with clinically recognized ALD phenotypes are at risk for adrenal insufficiency.[5]  There is no reliable way to predict which form of the disease an affected individual will develop, with multiple phenotypes being demonstrated within families.[7]  Onset of adrenal insufficiency is often the first symptom, appearing as early as two years of age.[6]",
    "Diagnosis": "The clinical presentation of ALD can vary greatly, making diagnosis difficult.  With the variety of phenotypes, clinical suspicion of ALD can result from a variety of different presentations.  Symptoms vary based on the disease phenotype, and even within families or between twins.[7]  When ALD is suspected based on clinical symptoms, the initial testing usually includes plasma very long chain fatty acid (VLCFA) determination using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.  The concentration of unsaturated VLCFA, particularly 26 carbon chains is significantly elevated in males with ALD, even prior to the development of other symptoms.[15] Confirmation of ALD after positive plasma VLCFA determination usually involves molecular genetic analysis of ABCD1.  In females, where plasma VLCFA measurement is not always conclusive (some female carriers will have normal VLCFA in plasma),[15] molecular analysis is preferred, particularly in cases where the mutation in the family is known.[4][6]  Although the clinical phenotype is highly variable among affected males, the elevations of VLCFA are present in all males with an ABCD1 mutation.[6]\nBecause the characteristic elevations associated with ALD are present at birth, well before any symptoms are apparent, there have been methods developed[16][17] in the interests of including it in newborn screening programs.[18]  One of the difficulties with ALD as a disease included in universal newborn screening is the difficulty in predicting the eventual phenotype that an individual will express.  The accepted treatment for affected boys presenting with the cerebral childhood form of the disease is a bone marrow transplant, a procedure which carries significant risks.[5][10]  However, because most affected males will demonstrate adrenal insufficiency, early discovery and treatment of this symptom could potentially prevent complications and allow these patients to be monitored for other treatment in the future, depending on the progression of their disease.[18]\nThe Loes score is a rating of the severity of abnormalities in the brain found on MRI. It ranges from 0 to 34, based on a point system derived from the location and extent of disease and the presence of atrophy in the brain, either localized to specific points or generally throughout the brain. A Loes score of 0.5 or less is classified as normal, while a Loes score of 14 or greater is considered severe. It was developed by neuroradiologist Daniel J. Loes MD and is an important tool in assessing disease progression and the effectiveness of therapy.[19]",
    "Treatment": "Initial attempts at dietary therapy in ALD involved restricting the intake of very-long chain fatty acids (VLCFA).  Dietary intake is not the only source for VLCFA in the body, as they are also synthesized endogenously.  This dietary restriction did not impact the levels of VLCFA in plasma and other body tissues.[5]  After the realization that endogenous synthesis was an important contribution to VLCFA in the body, efforts at dietary therapy shifted to inhibiting these synthetic pathways in the body.  The parents of Lorenzo Odone, a boy with ALD, spearheaded efforts to develop a dietary treatment to slow the progression of the disease.  They developed a mixture of unsaturated fatty acids (glycerol trioleate and glyceryl trierucate in a 4:1 ratio), known as Lorenzo's oil that inhibits elongation of saturated fatty acids in the body.[5][10] Supplementation with Lorenzo's oil has been found to normalize the VLCFA concentrations in the body, although its effectiveness at treating the cerebral manifestations of the disease is still controversial and unproven.[20]  Trials with Lorenzo's oil have shown that it does not stop the neurological degradation in symptomatic patients, nor does it improve adrenal function,[5] but asymptomatic patients, and speculatively AMN variants without cerebral involvement, as well as female carriers may benefit from early intake of oleic and erucic acids in addition to VLCFA restriction.[21]\nAdrenomix®:\nIn 2009, a second-generation mixture was created, adding to the glycerol trioleate (GTO) and trierucate glycerol (GTE), conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) a group of linoleic acid isomers capable of overcoming the blood-brain barrier. CLA, through the activation of peroxisome beta oxidation, increases the catabolism of pro-inflammatory molecules and ROS, acting as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant. The use of CLA was initially considered in relation to the ability to inhibit fatty acid synthase together with a hypolipidic diet. A group of Italian researchers of the Bambino Gesù Pediatric Hospital in Rome showed that the administration of Adrenomix (GTO, GTE and CLA), in addition to decreasing levels of VLCFA throughout the body, reduces neuro inflammation and improves somatosensory evoked potential, found unchanged or worsened with only administration of GTO and GTE.[22]\nAldixyl®:\nIn 2016, based on studies developed in recent years in the field of adrenoleukodystrophy and adrenomyelouropathy, a mixture was developed that adds to GTO, GTE and CLA, a mixture of\npowerful antioxidants at high dosages containing alpha lipoic acid (ALA), reduced L- glutathione and Vitamin E (α- tocopherol). Researchers at the IDIBELL- Hospital Duran i Reynals in Barcelona have shown that the early administration of a cocktail of powerful antioxidants, able to overcome the blood-brain barrier and thus carry out its activity at the CNS level, prevents the oxidative stress typical of the disease, intervenes on the initial axonal dysfunctions and therefore on locomotor damage.[23] This new mixture, unlike what happened with the administration of GTO and GTE alone, poorly accumulated at the level of the nervous system, enhances the anti-inflammatory activity and reduces the levels of VLCFA in the CNS by combining synergistically the activity of its components. In particular, CLA, in addition to overcoming the blood-brain barrier and regulating at the CNS level the metabolism of VLCFA is able to influence the catabolism of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids and lipid peroxidation products.[24][25][26][27][28] In this sense, the anti-inflammatory activity of ALA, reduced L-glutathione and Vitamin E is enhanced at the level of the whole body, and not only at the peripheral level as was the case in the past.[29]\nWhile dietary therapy has been shown to be effective to normalize the very-long chain fatty acid concentrations in the plasma of individuals with ALD, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants is the only treatment that can stop demyelination that is the hallmark of the cerebral forms of the disease.[10]  In order to be effective, the transplant must be done at an early stage of the disease; if the demyelination has progressed, transplant can worsen the outcome, and increase the rate of decline.  While transplants have been shown to be effective at halting the demyelination process in those presenting with the childhood cerebral form of ALD, follow-up of these patients has shown that it does not improve adrenal function.[30]\nFor patients where an appropriate match for a transplant cannot be found, there have been investigations into the use of gene therapy.  Appropriate vectors are selected and modified to express wild type ABCD1, which is then transplanted into the patients using a similar procedure as for a bone marrow or stem cell transplant.[10]  Gene therapy has only been tried on a small number of patients, mainly in France.  These patients were only considered for gene therapy after there was no HLA match for a traditional transplant.  In two reported cases, the gene therapy was successful, with a resolution of the demyelination process up to two years after the procedure.  Although the gene therapy was successful in resolving the neurological symptoms, plasma VLCFA levels remained elevated.[10]\nElivaldogene autotemcel is pending authorization by the European Commission as of May 2021[update]. While this treatment is effective with 90% of patients being free of major functional disabilities after treatment, it costs $3.0 million per treatment and it comes with several adverse effects including mucositis and alopecia.[31][32][33][34] There are also reports of hematologic cancer development in patients receiving this gene therapy, including myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia.[35]\nThe anti-diabetic medication pioglitazone was shown in a mouse model of ALD to be effective at treating the metabolic effects of ALD, including metabolic failure and increased oxidative stress. Pioglitazone was also shown to prevent axonal degeneration and increase mitochondria levels, as well as stop the progression of locomotor decline in ALD model mice.[36] Subsequently, the drug leriglitazone has been developed by Minoryx Therapeutics as a more brain penetrant metabolite of pioglitazone.[37] Currently, leriglitazone is in phase 2/3 clinical trials for adult and childhood cALD in the USA and the EU, and has completed a clinical trial for AMN.[38]\nTreatment of the adrenal insufficiency that can accompany any of the common male phenotypes of ALD does not resolve any of the neurological symptoms.  Hormone replacement is standard for ALD patients demonstrating adrenal insufficiency.[39]  Adrenal insufficiency does not resolve with successful transplant; most patients still require hormone replacement.[30]",
    "Epidemiology": "ALD has not been shown to have an increased incidence in any specific country or ethnic group.  In the United States, the incidence of affected males is estimated at 1:21,000.  Overall incidence of hemizygous males and carrier females is estimated at 1:16,800.[6]  The reported incidence in France is estimated at 1:22,000.[4]"

    "Disease": "Adult polyglucosan body disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Adult polyglucosan body disease is a condition that affects the nervous system. People with this condition have problems walking due to reduced sensation in their legs (peripheral neuropathy) and progressive muscle weakness and stiffness (spasticity). Damage to the nerves that control bladder function (neurogenic bladder) causes progressive difficulty in controlling the flow of urine. About half of people with adult polyglucosan body disease experience dementia.[1]  Most people with the condition first complain of bladder issues.[2]\nPeople with adult polyglucosan body disease typically first experience signs and symptoms related to the condition between ages 30 and 60.[1]",
    "Causes": "APBD is an autosomal recessive disorder that is caused when a person inherits genes from both parents containing one or more loss-of-function mutations in the gene GBE1 which encodes for glycogen branching enzyme, also called 1,4-alpha-glucan-branching enzyme.[3]",
    "Diagnosis": "Along with evaluation of the symptoms and a neurological examination, a diagnosis can be made based on genetic testing.  Whether or not a person is making sufficient amounts of functional glycogen branching enzyme can be determined by taking a skin biopsy and testing for activity of the enzyme.  Examination of tissue biopsied from the sural nerve under a microscope can reveal the presence of polyglucosan bodies.  There will also be white matter changes visible in a magnetic resonance imaging scans.[4]\nAdult polyglucosan body disease is an orphan disease and a glycogen storage disorder that is caused by an inborn error of metabolism, that affects the central and peripheral nervous systems.[4][5]\nThe condition in newborns caused by the same mutations is called glycogen storage disease type IV.[3]",
    "Treatment": "As of 2024[update], there is no cure for APBD; instead symptoms are managed.[6]  There are various approaches to managing neurogenic bladder dysfunction, physical therapy and mobility aids to help with walking, and dementia can be managed with occupational therapy, counseling and drugs.[3]",
    "Prognosis": "The rate of progression varies significantly from person to person.[4][6]\nThere is not good data on outcomes; it appears that APBD likely leads to earlier death, but people with APBD can live many years after diagnosis with relatively good quality of life.[4]",
    "Epidemiology": "The prevalence is unknown; about 70 cases had been reported in the medical literature as of 2016.[1]  As of 2016, the largest set of case studies included 50 people; about 70% of them were of Ashkenazic Jewish descent.[3][7]",

    "Disease": "Adult-onset Still%27s disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The disease typically presents with joint pain, high fevers, a salmon-pink macular or maculopapular rash, enlargement of the liver and spleen, swollen lymph nodes, and a neutrophil-predominant increased white blood cell count in the blood.[1] Tests for rheumatoid factor and anti-nuclear antibodies are usually negative and serum ferritin is markedly elevated. Patients experiencing a flare-up from adult-onset Still's disease usually report extreme fatigue, swelling of the lymph nodes and, less commonly, fluid accumulation in the lungs and heart. In rare cases, AOSD can cause life-threatening complications, including hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, intervertebral disc calcification (IVDC), fulminant hepatitis, or disabling conditions such as aseptic meningitis and sensorineural hearing loss.[7][8][9][1] Although more frequently described as associated with rheumatoid arthritis, Still's disease can lead to hematological complications such as thrombotic microangiopathy.[10]",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is clinical, not based upon serology.[13] At least seven sets of diagnostic criteria have been devised; however, the Yamaguchi criteria have the highest sensitivity. Diagnosis requires at least five features, with at least two of these being major diagnostic criteria.[14]\nPeople with AOSD generally experience one of two patterns in the disease:\nOne set of 21 adult-onset Still's disease patients were divided into four types, according to clinical course patterns. These included monocyclic systemic disease, polycyclic systemic disease, chronic articular monocyclic systemic disease, and chronic articular polycyclic systemic disease. People with chronic articular and polyarticular disease were at higher risk to develop disabling arthritis.[15]",
    "Treatment": "Adult-onset Still's disease is treated with anti-inflammatory medications. Steroids such as prednisone are used to treat severe symptoms of Still's. Other infrequently used medications include hydroxychloroquine, penicillamine, azathioprine, methotrexate, etanercept, cyclophosphamide, adalimumab, rituximab, and infliximab.[16]\nNewer medications target interleukin-1 (IL-1), particularly IL-1β.[17] A randomized, multicenter trial reported better outcomes in a group of 12 patients treated with anakinra than in a group of 10 patients taking other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.[18] In June 2020 FDA approved Ilaris (canakinumab) for the treatment of AOSD, this is the first FDA approved treatment for AOSD.[19] Canakinumab is another anti-IL1 drug which selectively binds IL-1β and rilonacept which blocks both IL-1A and IL-1β.[20] The monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody tocilizumab is another treatment option as effective as anakinra.[21]\nThe condition \"juvenile-onset Still's disease\" is now usually grouped under juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. However, there are obvious similarities between the two conditions,[4] and there is some evidence that they may be closely related.[5][6]",
    "Epidemiology": "Adult-onset Still's disease is rare and has been described all over the world. The number of new cases per year is estimated to be 1.6 per 1,000,000 population.[1] The number of people currently affected is estimated at 1.5 cases per 100,000–1,000,000 population.[22] Onset is most common in two age ranges, between ages 16–25 and between ages of 36–46 years.[23]"

    "Disease": "Aggressive fibromatosis",
    "Causes": "Wnt signaling pathway alterations are the likely cause of desmoid tumor formation.[8] Mutations have been discovered in both the beta-catenin encoding CTNNB1 gene and the tumor-suppressing APC gene, which affect the Wnt pathway. A 2015 study on desmoid tumors lacking these mutations found that almost all, 95%, \"may have mutations that affect the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, suggesting a near universal relationship between desmoid tumors and Wnt signaling.\"[8]\nThe majority of cases are sporadic, most of which – 85% – involve a CTNNB1 mutation.[9] Of these, \"the three distinct mutations identified are 41A, 45F, and 45. Mutation 45F is associated with a high risk of recurrence.\"[1] APC mutations affect FAP patients and make up a smaller percentage, 10–15%, of sporadic cases.[9]\nThe disease has a tendency to occur during and after pregnancy and in exposure to higher estrogen levels, suggesting a hormonal link.[10] One study noted the formation of desmoid tumors in guinea pigs after prolonged estrogen exposure.[11] Other factors include trauma and surgery.[8]\nRisk factors for desmoid disease amongst FAP patients include female sex, a 3' APC mutation, a positive family history, and a history of previous abdominal surgery.[12]",
    "Diagnosis": "A biopsy is always indicated as the definitive method to determine the nature of the tumor.[1] Diagnosis may be difficult in part due to the use of core needle biopsy over open biopsy.[13]\nSimilarities among bland spindle-cell lesions lead to a large number of possibilities in diagnosis, including fibroblastic sarcomas, Gardner fibroma, scar tissue or keloids, superficial fibromatosis, nodular fasciitis, myofibroma, collagenous fibroma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, solitary fibrous tumor, phyllodes tumor, and other conditions. Such conditions may therefore also be incorrectly diagnosed as desmoid tumors (29% of cases in one review).[14][10][15][16] Some 30–40% of desmoid tumors may be misdiagnosed.[17]\nDesmoid tumors can occur almost anywhere in the body.[18] They are classified as extra-abdominal, abdominal wall, or intra-abdominal; the last is more common in patients with FAP.[19] Most cases occur in the mesentery, abdominal wall, and extremities.[20] One study has shown extra-abdominal tumors making up 43% of cases, abdominal tumors 49%, and mesenteric 8%, though statistics vary.[11] Pregnancy-related tumors typically arise in the abdominal wall.[21] Tumors located intra-abdominally or in the head and neck have the highest risk of mortality due to the proximity to vital structures.[22]\nOne analysis has shown a median tumor size of 7.5 cm (3.0 in).[18] Though metastasis cannot occur, the tumors may in some cases be multifocal, with several located in the same body part.[23]\nA 3' APC mutation is the most significant risk factor for intra-abdominal desmoid development amongst FAP patients.[24] FAP patients presenting with an abdominal wall desmoid pre-operatively are at an increased risk of developing an intra-abdominal desmoid post-operatively.[25]\nDesmoid tumors of the breast are rare, constituting 4% of extra-abdominal cases and 0.2–0.3% of breast tumors.[20][16] Although benign, they can mimic breast cancer on physical examination, mammography and breast ultrasound and can also be locally invasive. Even though they occur sporadically, they can also be seen as a part of Gardner's syndrome. Some cases – up to 44% – occur in patients who have previously had breast surgery.[26] A high index of suspicion and a thorough triple examination protocol is necessary to detect rare lesions like a desmoid tumor which can masquerade as breast carcinoma. Desmoid tumor of the breast may present a difficulty in the diagnosis especially where imaging studies are not conclusive and suggest a more ominous diagnosis.[27] They may arise in the chest wall or the breast itself.[11][16]\nDesmoid tumors may occur in the head and neck, more commonly among children, and tend to be more aggressive than in other extra-abdominal locations. These tumors constitute up to 23% of extra-abdominal cases.[11] Treatment is typically more aggressive due to the increased dangers of a tumor in the area.[23][28]\nThere is no standard staging system; desmoid tumors do not fall under cancer staging systems as they do not metastasize.[26]",
    "Treatment": "Nirogacestat, a selective gamma secretase inhibitor, was approved for medical use in the United States in November 2023.[29] It is the first medication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of desmoid tumors.[29][30]\nA Phase 2/3 trial on AL102, another selective gamma secretase inhibitor, is also ongoing as of 2023[update], having begun in 2021.[31] The drug was granted orphan drug status in 2023.[32]\nWnt pathway inhibitors are also being developed and studied as of 2024[update]. These include E7386, tegavivint and ipafricept.[33] Additionally, the tumor microenvironment in desmoid tumors is being investigated to find new targets for treatment.[34]\nSurgery was the standard treatment for desmoid tumors up to the early 2000s.[2][35] Due to the condition's unpredictability, more conservative management such as watchful waiting has since become common due to the potential impacts of surgical interventions. As of the 2010s, there is a \"clear consensus\"[2] from medical groups, including the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Soft Tissue and Bone Sarcoma Group and the European Society for Medical Oncology: immediate surgical resection is no longer the first-line treatment, particularly in asymptomatic patients.[8][20][2] Complete removal is not always possible due to the tumors' infiltrative nature and tendril-like growth.[10]\nIn more advanced, recurring, or rapidly progressing cases, treatment may consist of complete surgical removal, radiation therapy, antiestrogens (e.g. tamoxifen), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), chemotherapy (e.g. methotrexate and vinblastine or vinorelbine, doxorubicin), or ablation (cold, heat, ultrasound). Treatment with oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor drugs (e.g. imatinib, sorafenib, pazopanib, sunitinib) shows promising success rates.[36][23][37][33][38] Radiation therapy after surgery may improve outcomes.[10][38] Despite the condition's hormonal link, anti-hormonal therapies only appear to work in a small subset of patients.[10]\nIntestinal transplant is a treatment option for those patients with complicated desmoid tumor, such as those involving the mesenteric root, or those with intestinal failure resulting from the tumor or prior interventions.[39]\nMRI or CT imaging scans are commonly used for monitoring.[40][1]\nIn contrast with cancer, management of desmoid tumors considers additional outcomes beyond progression-free survival and overall survival, as desmoid tumor patients' \"survival is longer and ... age of onset is generally younger compared with cancer patient populations\".[41]",
    "Prognosis": "The condition is \"characterized by a variable and often unpredictable clinical course\",[2] often considered chronic,[8] and with the potential to be debilitating.[7] Death, however, is uncommon.[22][41] Tumors may grow, regress, or remain stable:[17]\nManagement of these lesions is complex, the main problem being the high rates of recurrence particularly in FAP-associated disease. Recurrence rates in general vary from 19 to 77 percent.[11] Conversely, for intra-abdominal fibromatosis without evidence of FAP, although extensive surgery may still be required for local symptoms, the risk of recurrence appears to be lower.[42]\nOne review summarizes the disease's impact on patients stating, \"the burden of [desmoid tumors] is disproportionately borne by women of childbearing and working age, and because it is associated with low mortality and a relatively young patient population, it typically continues for decades.\"[41]\nSymptoms vary significantly as they are dependent on the tumor's location and effects on the surrounding structures.[41] Though desmoid tumors do not metastasize, their invasiveness may lead to pain and loss of function or restricted movement. Chronic pain is an issue for as many as 63% of patients and may be debilitating and lead to reliance on pain medication.[17][41] Pressure on vital organs or deformity may occur.[17][10] Rarely, amputation may be necessary due to injury caused by the tumor or its treatments.[41]\nTumors may be misdiagnosed (30–40%)[17] due to their rarity and a lack of knowledge; patients may initially be given inappropriate treatment or poor prognoses due to misdiagnosis with conditions such as malignant sarcoma.[43][44] Patients may need to visit multiple healthcare providers to receive a diagnosis, causing delay in care. Patients may experience issues including anxiety, fatigue, or trouble sleeping; despite the increased survival rate, their level of emotional distress has been compared to that of cancer patients, including \"patients with sarcoma, also a malignant connective tissue disorder\".[17][44][41] A lack of knowledge by healthcare providers and of information available to patients and others have also been cited as issues.[43]\nThe economic burden of treatment may be significant, with surgery costs estimated at $50,000 in 2022 US dollars.[35]\nSpecific instruments to determine health-related quality of life impacts for desmoid patients, the Gounder/Desmoid Tumor Research Foundation (DTRF) Desmoid Symptom/Impact Scale (GODDESS) and the Desmoid-type fibromatosis Quality of Life Questionnaire (DTF-QOL) have been developed and validated.[17]",
    "Epidemiology": "The incidence of desmoid tumors is 5–6 per million per year;[2] they constitute 0.03% of tumors and less than 3% of soft-tissue tumors. The primary age range is 15–60, with a peak between 30 and 40 years old; it is 2–3 times more common in females than males.[1][45][41] A 2012 retrospective multi-institutional analysis of 211 patients found a median age of 36 and a 68% female prevalence.[18] Children do not have the same sex disparity and are most commonly affected around 15 or 16 years old.[22]"

    "Disease": "Alexander disease",
    "Causes": "Alexander disease is a genetic disorder primarily affecting the midbrain and cerebellum of the central nervous system. It is caused by mutations in the gene for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)[11][12][13] that maps to chromosome 17q21. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, such that the child of a parent with the disease has a 50% chance of inheriting the condition, if the parent is heterozygotic. However, most cases arise de novo as the result of sporadic mutations.[3]\nAlexander disease belongs to leukodystrophies, a group of diseases that affect the growth or development of the myelin sheath. The destruction of white matter in the brain is accompanied by the formation of fibrous, eosinophilic deposits known as Rosenthal fibers.[3][14][15]",
    "Diagnosis": "Detecting the signs of Alexander disease is possible with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which looks for specific changes in the brain that may be tell-tale signs for the disease.[22][23] It is even possible to detect adult-onset Alexander disease with MRI.[17] Alexander disease may also be revealed by genetic testing for its known cause.[24][25] A rough diagnosis may also be made through revealing of clinical symptoms, including enlarged head size, along with radiological studies, and negative tests for other leukodystrophies.[21] However, due to the similarity of symptoms to other diseases such as multiple sclerosis, many adults experience misdiagnosis until they receive an MRI scan confirming Alexander disease pathology.[10]",
    "Treatment": "There is no known cure for Alexander disease.[4] Treatment varies greatly between patients, and treatment plans consist of therapies for specific symptoms, such as shunts to relieve pressure caused by hydrocephalus[21], or antiepileptic medications to treat seizures.[4]\nRecent studies have tested experimental treatments, but none have been approved for clinical use. A University of Wisconsin study shows promise with gene editing of the astrocytes.[3][14][18] A phase III clinical trial of an antisense therapy, sponsored by Ionis Pharmaceuticals, began in 2021.[26] A bone marrow transplant has been attempted on a child, but it made no improvement.[27][4]",
    "Prognosis": "The prognosis is generally poor.  Individuals with the infantile form usually die before the age of seven.[28] The average duration of the infantile form is usually about three years. Duration of the juvenile form is about six years.[1] Usually, the later the disease occurs, the slower its course.[3][14]",
    "Epidemiology": "Its occurrence is very rare, with an estimated 1 in 2.7 million prevalence. More Type I cases have been reported than Type II cases, but researchers believe this may be due to high rates of misdiagnosis in adults. [1][10]"

    "Disease": "Alkaptonuria",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Patients with alkaptonuria are asymptomatic as children or young adults, but their urine may turn brown or even inky black if collected and left exposed to open air.[1] Pigmentation may be noted in the cartilage of the ear and other cartilage,[1][2] and the sclera and corneal limbus of the eye.[3]\nAfter the age of 30, people begin to develop pain in the weight-bearing joints of the spine, hips, and knees. The pain can be severe to the point that interferes with activities of daily living and may affect the ability to work. Joint-replacement surgery (hip and shoulder) is often necessary at a relatively young age.[1] In the longer term, the involvement of the spinal joints leads to reduced movement of the rib cage and can affect breathing.[1] Bone mineral density may be affected, increasing the risk of bone fractures, and rupture of tendons and muscles may occur.[1]\nValvular heart disease, mainly calcification and regurgitation of the aortic and mitral valves, may occur, and in severe and progressive cases, valve replacement may be necessary. Irregularities in the heart rhythm and heart failure affect a significant proportion of people with alkaptonuria (40% and 10%, respectively).[1] Hearing loss affects 40% of people. Also, a propensity to developing kidney stones exists, and eventually also gallstones and stones in the prostate and salivary glands (sialolithiasis) can occur.[1]",
    "Diagnosis": "If the diagnosis of alkaptonuria is suspected, it can be confirmed or excluded by collecting urine for 24 hours and determining the amount of homogentisic acid by means of chromatography. No assay of HGA in blood has been validated.[1] The Genetic Testing Registry  is used for maintaining information about the genetic test for alkaptonuria.[5]\nThe severity of the symptoms and response to treatment can be quantified through a validated questionnaire titled the AKU Severity Score Index. This  assigns scores to the presence of particular symptoms and features, such as the presence of eye and skin pigmentation, joint pain, heart problems, and organ stones.[1]",
    "Treatment": "In 2012 the  AKU Society formed a consortium called  DevelopAKUre to prove that nitisinone, a drug already approved for treating another rare disease,  hereditary tyrosinaemia type-1, could be repurposed to treat AKU.[citation needed]\nThe DevelopAKUre trials concluded in 2019 and successfully illustrated that nitisinone lowered levels of homogentisic acid (HGA), the acid that causes the damage in AKU, by 99% which effectively halts the progression of the disease. In 2020, the European Medicines Agency and the European Commission approved the use of nitisinone for treating AKU making the treatment available to patients across the Europe and the UK.[citation needed]\nNitisinone has revolutionised the treatment of AKU, however it can lead to a condition known as hypertyrosinaemia[6] caused by elevated levels of the amino acid tyrosine. Hypertyrosinaemia can lead to serious symptoms including corneal keratopathy,[7] dermal toxicity,[8]  neurodevelopment delay issues in children,[9] and alterations of wider metabolism.[10] There is currently no effective treatment for hypertyrosinaemia other than limiting protein intake. Due to the potential side-effects of nitisinone treatment it is currently only prescribed to children aged 16 and above in Europe and patients will then have to follow a protein restricted diet and closely manage their tyrosine levels through frequent monitoring.[citation needed]",
    "Prognosis": "Alkaptonuria does not appear to affect life expectancy, although the latest study on the topic is from 1985.[1] The main impact is on quality of life; many people with alkaptonuria have disabling symptoms such as pain, poor sleep, and breathing symptoms. These generally start in the fourth decade. The typical age at requiring joint replacement surgery is 50–55 years.[1]",
    "Epidemiology": "In most ethnic groups, the prevalence of alkaptonuria is between 1:100,000 and 1:250,000.[4] In Slovakia and the Dominican Republic, the disease is much more common, with prevalence estimated at 1:19,000 people.[4] As for Slovakia, this is not the result of a single mutation, but due to a group of 12 mutations in specific \"hot spots\" of the HGD gene.[4] The Slovakian clustering probably arose in a small area in the northwest of the country and spread after the 1950s due to migration.[4]",
    "Society and culture": "The AKU Society is a charity which support all people affected by AKU. Based in the UK, the charity can be contacted here. It has a number of international AKU sister societies who provide support across the world.[citation needed]\nThe AKU Society works to provide information, education, support, and helps people to access treatment for their condition. A number of support resources are available here and they have also been  translated into all major languages here[citation needed]\nAs part of the DevelopAKUre consortium, the AKU Society successfully proved the effectiveness of nitisinone to treat AKU, leading to the drug receiving approval from the European Medicines Agency in 2020.

Management focuses on symptomatic treatment and supportive care, including dietary modifications (e.g., a low-lysine diet) to reduce the accumulation of toxic metabolites.

    "Disease": "Alpha-mannosidosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Alpha-mannosidosis is a lifelong multi-systemic progressive disease, with neuromuscular and skeletal deterioration over decades.[2] The timing of the appearance of symptoms correlates with the severity of the disease. The onset of the most severe form of the disease occurs within the first months of life and involves skeletal abnormalities and intellectual disability, with rapid progression leading to death from primary central nervous system involvement or myopathy.[2] However, most neonates with lysosomal storage disorders are asymptomatic and only rarely severely affected.[1][6] This delays diagnosis, particularly as milder forms of the disease involve only mild to moderate intellectual disability, which progresses gradually during childhood or adolescence.[7]\nThe first decade of life is characterised by the development of hearing impairment, psychomotor delay, recurrent infections, especially upper airway infections, pulmonary infections and acute/serous otitis media infections.[8] Significant changes in a number of facial features may occur, such as protruding forehead, flattened nasal bridge, small nose, wide mouth, and widely spaced teeth.[2] Muscular weakness or spinal abnormalities can occur due to the build-up of storage materials in the muscle.[2]",
    "Diagnosis": "Alpha-mannosidosis is a progressive disorder, and its presence should be suspected in patients with cognitive disabilities, skeletal changes (e.g., swollen joints, curved spine), hearing loss and recurrent infections. Although children with the condition are often born seemingly normal, their condition deteriorates with age. Alpha-mannosidosis can impact a patient's quality of life in many ways, including their ability to live independently, socialise or find employment.[2][8]\nGenerally, phenotypes of alpha-mannosidosis patients are not clearly distinguishable, which makes a prediction of the clinical course for an individual patient challenging.[2] Patients may present to doctors, nurses or health visitors at different stages of progression, and with different ad hoc symptoms, making the link to suspect a diagnosis of alpha-mannosidosis difficult.[2] The main symptoms can also be shared with those of other lysosomal storage disorders, such as mucopolysaccharidosis.[2]\nGiven the progressive nature of the disease, the earlier a correct diagnosis is achieved the better.[2] The condition is often diagnosed and treated using a multi-disciplinary approach, involving paediatricians, orthopaedics, ophthalmologists, otologists, neurologists, immunologists, neurosurgeons and physiotherapists.[8]\nA diagnosis of alpha-mannosidosis is suspected based upon identification of characteristic findings of a multi-symptomatic presentation, a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and results from the diagnostic tests described below:",
    "Treatment": "There is no cure for congenital alpha-mannosidosis, and in general, the approach to management is proactive, with the aim of preventing emerging complications. After a full physical examination, physicians should focus on the known complications of alpha-mannosidosis, such as hydrocephalus, otitis media, hearing loss, dental caries, joint symptoms, kyphoscoliosis, and mental state.[2] Treatment is often limited to reducing or controlling the symptoms of the condition by, for example, medications to control seizures, hearing aids to ameliorate hearing loss, and routine physical therapy to assist with muscular pain and weakness.[2] In some cases, a wheelchair may be appropriate if muscle or spinal impairments immobilize the individual affected.[citation needed]\nHematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can be a treatment option for some patients, however the risk-benefit profile is more favourable in younger patients, therefore ensuring an early diagnosis is critical for this to be a viable option.[2] The rationale is that enzyme-producing donor cells repopulate the host tissue and transfer enzyme to nearby enzyme-deficient host cells.[2] Despite early reports to the contrary,[10][11][2] The possible benefits of HSCT must be weighed against the overall risk of procedure related morbidity and mortality. The benefits are greater in younger patients before complications have developed, and also transplant related complications are more frequent and severe in older patients.[citation needed]\nEnzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is a therapeutic alternative in a number of lysosomal storage diseases.[2][8] The overall principle of ERT is that a recombinantly produced version of the deficient enzyme is introduced into the blood stream, from where it is internalised by the cells and reaches the lysosomes by mannose-6-phosphate receptor mediated uptake, thus replacing the missing endogenous enzyme.[8] An ERT with velmanase alfa is approved for use in the European Union and the US.[12]",
    "Prognosis": "The long-term forecast for the condition is poor.[2] There is generally a slow progression of neuromuscular and bone changes over decades. Behavioural problems or psychiatric disorders may also be present.[2][8] The life expectancy in alpha-mannosidosis is highly variable. Individuals with early onset severe disease often do not survive beyond childhood, whereas those with milder disorders may survive well into adult life.[citation needed]\nIndependent living will be difficult, and patients with alpha-mannosidosis may become socially isolated, and during the late stages of the disease they may become wheelchair-using, as they can no longer walk unaided.[2] This is likely to have a negative impact upon the quality of life of caregivers and family members.[2][8]",
    "Epidemiology": "The worldwide incidence of alpha-mannosidosis is not known exactly. However, a number of reports from different countries estimate that it occurs in approximately one in every million babies born worldwide.[9] Mannosidosis is found in all ethnic groups in Europe, America, Africa, and Asia.[2]"

Sensory nerves and the autonomic nervous system are generally unaffected, meaning the majority of people with ALS maintain hearing, sight, touch, smell, and taste.[3]\nThe start of ALS may be so subtle that the symptoms are overlooked.[3] The earliest symptoms of ALS are muscle weakness or muscle atrophy, typically on one side of the body. Other presenting symptoms include trouble swallowing or breathing, cramping, or stiffness of affected muscles; muscle weakness affecting an arm or a leg; or slurred and nasal speech. The parts of the body affected by early symptoms of ALS depend on which motor neurons in the body are damaged first.[35]\nIn limb-onset ALS, the first symptoms are in the arms or the legs. If the legs are affected first, people may experience awkwardness, tripping, or stumbling when walking or running; this is often marked by walking with a \"dropped foot\" that drags gently on the ground. If the arms are affected first, they may experience difficulty with tasks requiring manual dexterity, such as buttoning a shirt, writing, or turning a key in a lock.[36]\nIn bulbar-onset ALS, the first symptoms are difficulty speaking or swallowing. Speech may become slurred, nasal in character, or quieter. There may be difficulty with swallowing and loss of tongue mobility. A smaller proportion of people experience \"respiratory-onset\" ALS, where the intercostal muscles that support breathing are affected first.[19]\nOver time, people experience increasing difficulty moving, swallowing (dysphagia), and speaking or forming words (dysarthria). Symptoms of upper motor neuron involvement include tight and stiff muscles (spasticity) and exaggerated reflexes (hyperreflexia), including an overactive gag reflex.[24] While the disease does not cause pain directly, pain is a symptom experienced by most people with ALS, caused by reduced mobility, and possibly also some sensory nerve dysfunction.[37] Symptoms of lower motor neuron degeneration include muscle weakness and atrophy, muscle cramps, and fleeting twitches of muscles that can be seen under the skin (fasciculations).[25]\nAlthough the initial site of symptoms and subsequent rate of disability progression vary from person to person, the initially affected body region is usually the most affected over time, and symptoms usually spread to a neighbouring body region. For example, symptoms starting in one arm usually spread to either the opposite arm or to the leg on the same side.[24] Bulbar-onset patients most typically experience their next symptoms in their arms rather than legs, arm-onset patients typically spread to the legs before the bulbar region, and leg-onset patients typically spread to the arms rather than the bulbar region.[38] Over time, regardless of where symptoms began, most people eventually lose the ability to walk or use their hands and arms independently. Less consistently, they may lose the ability to speak and to swallow food. It is the eventual development of weakness of the respiratory muscles, with the loss of ability to cough and to breathe without mechanical support, that is ultimately life-shortening in ALS.[5]\nThe rate of progression can be measured using the ALS Functional Rating Scale - Revised (ALSFRS-R), a 12-item instrument survey administered as a clinical interview or self-reported questionnaire that produces a score between 48 (normal function) and 0 (severe disability).[39] The ALSFRS-R is the most frequently used outcome measure in clinical trials[40] and is used by doctors to track disease progression.[41] Though the degree of variability is high and a small percentage of people have a much slower progression, on average people with ALS lose about 1 ALSFRS-R point per month.[42] Brief periods of stabilization (\"plateaus\") and even small reversals in ALSFRS-R score are not uncommon, due to the fact the tool is subjective, can be affected by medication, and different forms of compensation for changes in function.[43] However, it is rare (<1%) for these improvements to be large (i.e. greater than 4 ALSFRS-R points) or sustained (i.e. greater than 12 months).[43] A survey-based study among clinicians showed that they rated a 20% change in the slope of the ALSFRS-R as being clinically meaningful, which is the most common threshold used to determine whether a new treatment is working in clinical trials.[44]\nDifficulties with chewing and swallowing make eating very difficult (dysphagia) and increase the risk of choking or of aspirating food into the lungs.[45] In later stages of the disorder, aspiration pneumonia can develop, and maintaining a healthy weight can become a significant problem that may require the insertion of a feeding tube.[45] As the diaphragm and intercostal muscles of the rib cage that support breathing weaken, measures of lung function such as vital capacity and inspiratory pressure diminish. In respiratory-onset ALS, this may occur before significant limb weakness is apparent. Individuals affected by the disorder may ultimately lose the ability to initiate and control all voluntary movement,[5] known as locked-in syndrome. Bladder and bowel function are usually spared, meaning urinary and fecal incontinence are uncommon, although trouble getting to a toilet can lead to difficulties. The extraocular muscles responsible for eye movement are usually spared,[46] meaning the use of eye tracking technology to support augmentative communication is often feasible, albeit slow, and needs may change over time.[47] Despite these challenges, many people in an advanced state of disease report satisfactory well-being and quality of life.[48]\nAlthough respiratory support using non-invasive ventilation can ease problems with breathing and prolong survival,[49] it does not affect the progression rate of ALS. Most people with ALS die between two and four years after the diagnosis.[5] Around 50% of people with ALS die within 30 months of their symptoms beginning, about 20% live between five and ten years,[19] and about 10% survive for 10 years or longer.[20]\nThe most common cause of death among people with ALS is respiratory failure, often accelerated by pneumonia.[19] Most ALS patients die at home after a period of worsening difficulty breathing, a decline in their nutritional status, or a rapid worsening of symptoms.[50] Sudden death or acute respiratory distress are uncommon.[51] Access to palliative care is recommended from an early stage to explore options, ensure psychosocial support for the patient and caregivers, and to discuss advance healthcare directives.[50]\nAs with cancer staging, ALS has staging systems numbered between 1 and 4 that are used for research purposes in clinical trials.[6] Two very similar staging systems emerged around a similar time, the King's staging system and Milano-Torino (MiToS) functional staging.[52]\nProviding individual patients with a precise prognosis is not currently possible, though research is underway to provide statistical models on the basis of prognostic factors including age at onset, progression rate, site of onset, and presence of frontotemporal dementia.[6] Those with a bulbar onset have a worse prognosis than limb-onset ALS; a population-based study found that bulbar-onset ALS patients had a median survival of 2.0 years and a 10-year survival rate of 3%, while limb-onset ALS patients had a median survival of 2.6 years and a 10-year survival rate of 13%.[53] Those with respiratory-onset ALS had a shorter median survival of 1.4 years and 0% survival at 10 years.[53] While astrophysicist Stephen Hawking lived for 55 more years following his diagnosis, his was an unusual case.[54]\nCognitive impairment or behavioral dysfunction is present in 30–50% of individuals with ALS,[55] and can appear more frequently in later stages of the disease.[56] Language dysfunction, executive dysfunction, and troubles with social cognition and verbal memory are the most commonly reported cognitive symptoms in ALS.[56] Cognitive impairment is found more frequently in patients with C9orf72 gene repeat expansions, bulbar onset, bulbar symptoms, family history of ALS, and/or a predominantly upper motor neuron phenotype.[57]\nEmotional lability is a symptom in which patients cry, smile, yawn, or laugh, either in the absence of emotional stimuli, or when they are feeling the opposite emotion to that being expressed;[58] it is experienced by about half of ALS patients and is more common in those with bulbar-onset ALS.[5] While relatively benign relative to other symptoms, it can cause increased stigma and social isolation as people around the patient struggle to react appropriately to what can be frequent and inappropriate outbursts in public.[59]\nIn addition to mild changes in cognition that may only emerge during neuropsychological testing, around 10–15% of individuals have signs of frontotemporal dementia (FTD).[5] Repeating phrases or gestures, apathy, and loss of inhibition are the most frequently reported behavioral features of ALS.[60] ALS and FTD are now considered to be part of a common disease spectrum (ALS–FTD) because of genetic, clinical, and pathological similarities.[61] Genetically, repeat expansions in the C9orf72 gene account for about 40% of genetic ALS and 25% of genetic FTD.[62]\nCognitive and behavioral issues are associated with a poorer prognosis as they may reduce adherence to medical advice, and deficits in empathy and social cognition, which may increase caregiver burden.[63]",
    "Causes": "It is not known what causes sporadic ALS, hence it is described as an idiopathic disease.[19] Though its exact cause is unknown, genetic and environmental factors are thought to be of roughly equal importance.[13] The genetic factors are better understood than the environmental factors; no specific environmental factor has been definitively shown to cause ALS. A multi-step liability threshold model for ALS proposes that cellular damage accumulates over time due to genetic factors present at birth and exposure to environmental risks throughout life.[64] ALS can strike at any age, but its likelihood increases with age.[65] Most people who develop ALS are between the ages of 40 and 70, with an average age of 55 at the time of diagnosis.[66] ALS is 20% more common in men than women,[66] but this difference in sex distribution is no longer present in patients with onset after age 70.[65]",
    "Diagnosis": "No single test can provide a definite diagnosis of ALS.[3] Instead, the diagnosis of ALS is primarily made based on a physician's clinical assessment after ruling out other diseases.[3] Physicians often obtain the person's full medical history and conduct neurologic examinations at regular intervals to assess whether signs and symptoms such as muscle weakness, muscle atrophy, hyperreflexia, Babinski's sign, and spasticity are worsening.[3] Many biomarkers are being studied for the condition, but as of 2023 are not in general medical use.[92]\nBecause symptoms of ALS can be similar to those of a wide variety of other, more treatable diseases or disorders, appropriate tests must be conducted to exclude the possibility of other conditions. One of these tests is electromyography (EMG), a special recording technique that detects electrical activity in muscles. Certain EMG findings can support the diagnosis of ALS. Another common test measures nerve conduction velocity (NCV).[93] Specific abnormalities in the NCV results may suggest, for example, that the person has a form of peripheral neuropathy (damage to peripheral nerves) or myopathy (muscle disease) rather than ALS. While a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often normal in people with early-stage ALS, it can reveal evidence of other problems that may be causing the symptoms, such as a spinal cord tumor, multiple sclerosis, a herniated disc in the neck, syringomyelia, or cervical spondylosis.[3]\nBased on the person's symptoms and findings from the examination and from these tests, the physician may order tests on blood and urine samples to eliminate the possibility of other diseases, as well as routine laboratory tests. In some cases, for example, if a physician suspects the person may have a myopathy rather than ALS, a muscle biopsy may be performed.[3]\nSeveral infectious diseases can sometimes cause ALS-like symptoms,[3] including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV), Lyme disease, and syphilis.[10] Neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis, post-polio syndrome, multifocal motor neuropathy, CIDP, spinal muscular atrophy, and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy can also mimic certain aspects of the disease and should be considered.[3]\nALS must be differentiated from the \"ALS mimic syndromes\", which are unrelated disorders that may have a similar presentation and clinical features to ALS or its variants.[94] Because the prognosis of ALS and closely related subtypes of motor neuron disease is generally poor, neurologists may carry out investigations to evaluate and exclude other diagnostic possibilities. Disorders of the neuromuscular junction, such as myasthenia gravis (MG) and Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome, may also mimic ALS, although this rarely presents diagnostic difficulty over time.[95][96] Benign fasciculation syndrome and cramp fasciculation syndrome may also, occasionally, mimic some of the early symptoms of ALS. Nonetheless, the absence of other neurological features that develop inexorably with ALS means that, over time, the distinction will not present any difficulty to the experienced neurologist; where doubt remains, EMG may be helpful.[97]",
    "Treatment": "Difficulties with chewing and swallowing make eating very difficult (dysphagia) and increase the risk of choking or of aspirating food into the lungs.[45] In later stages of the disorder, aspiration pneumonia can develop, and maintaining a healthy weight can become a significant problem that may require the insertion of a feeding tube.[45] As the diaphragm and intercostal muscles of the rib cage that support breathing weaken, measures of lung function such as vital capacity and inspiratory pressure diminish.

    "Epidemiology": "ALS is the most common motor neuron disease in adults and the third most common neurodegenerative disease[62] after Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.[126] Worldwide the number of people who develop ALS yearly is estimated to be 1.9 people per 100,000 per year, while the number of people who have ALS at any given time is estimated to be about 4.5 people per 100,000.[127] In Europe, the number of new cases a year is about 2.6 people per 100,000, while the number affected is 7–9 people per 100,000.[128] The lifetime risk of developing ALS is 1:350 for European men and 1:400 for European women. Men have a higher risk mainly because spinal-onset ALS is more common in men than women.[64] The number of those with ALS in the United States in 2015 was 5.2 people per 100,000, and was higher in whites, males, and people over 60 years old.[129] The number of new cases is about 0.8 people per 100,000 per year in East Asia and about 0.7 people per 100,000 per year in South Asia. About 80% of ALS epidemiology studies have been conducted in Europe and the United States, mostly in people of northern European descent.[11] There is not enough information to determine the rates of ALS in much of the world, including Africa, parts of Asia, India, Russia, and South America.[64] There are several geographic clusters in the Western Pacific where the prevalence of ALS was reported to be 50–100 times higher than in the rest of the world, including Guam, the Kii Peninsula of Japan, and Western New Guinea. The incidence in these areas has decreased since the 1960s;[1] the cause remains unknown.[64]\nPeople of all races and ethnic backgrounds may be affected by ALS,[129] but it is more common in whites than in Africans, Asians, or Hispanics.[130] In the United States in 2015, the prevalence of ALS in whites was 5.4 people per 100,000, while the prevalence in blacks was 2.3 people per 100,000. The Midwest had the highest prevalence of the four US Census regions, with 5.5 people per 100,000, followed by the Northeast (5.1), the South (4.7), and the West (4.4). The Midwest and Northeast likely had a higher prevalence of ALS because they have a higher proportion of whites than the South and West.[129] Ethnically mixed populations may be at a lower risk of developing ALS; a study in Cuba found that people of mixed ancestry were less likely to die from ALS than whites or blacks.[131] There are also differences in the genetics of ALS between different ethnic groups; the most common ALS gene in Europe is C9orf72, followed by SOD1, TARDBP, and FUS, while the most common ALS gene in Asia is SOD1, followed by FUS, C9orf72, and TARDBP.[132]\nALS can affect people at any age,[55] but the peak incidence is between 50 and 75 years[10] and decreases dramatically after 80 years.[19] The reason for the decreased incidence in the elderly is unclear. One thought is that people who survive into their 80s may not be genetically susceptible to developing ALS; alternatively, ALS in the elderly might go undiagnosed because of comorbidities (other diseases they have), difficulty seeing a neurologist, or dying quickly from an aggressive form of ALS.[131] In the United States in 2015, the lowest prevalence was in the 18–39 age group, while the highest prevalence was in the 70–79 age group.[129] Sporadic ALS usually starts around the ages of 58 to 63 years, while genetic ALS starts earlier, usually around 47 to 52 years.[19] The number of ALS cases worldwide is projected to increase from 222,801 in 2015 to 376,674 in 2040, an increase of 69%. This will largely be due to the aging of the world's population, especially in developing countries.[130]"

    "Disease": "Alveolar capillary dysplasia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "ACD is a congenital disease whose symptoms appear within hours to days after birth. Babies with ACD usually have no symptoms at the time of birth, but soon after will begin to breathe rapidly, showing increased work of breathing, and may have blue discoloration around the lips, arms, or legs, especially when feeding or crying. If an echocardiogram is performed, marked thickening of the right ventricle will be seen, resulting from highly elevated pulmonary blood pressure. ACD is generally resistant to treatment. Babies who have persistent symptoms that are poorly relieved by standard therapies for neonatal pulmonary hypertension is commonly observed in ACD.[1]\nAtypical forms of ACD have been reported with only mildly rapid breathing shortly after birth. They may present with the above symptoms of ACD at several months of age. Their symptoms may improve with standard pulmonary hypertension therapies for weeks to months before symptoms return.[1]\nBabies born with ACD usually have other congenital abnormalities affecting the heart, the intestines, urinary system, or genitals.[1]",
    "Causes": "Most cases of ACD are caused by deletions or point mutations involving the gene FOXF1 on chromosome 16 or an area near the FOXF1 gene that regulates its expression. ACD is an autosomal dominant disorder, meaning only one disease-causing mutation affecting FOXF1 or its regulator region is needed to cause ACD. Evidence strongly suggests that the FOXF1 regulatory region is imprinted, which might affect disease severity and may permit some to carry the disease with few or no symptoms.[3]",
    "Diagnosis": "The gold standard for ACD diagnosis is by examination of lung tissue under a microscope. The diagnosis is made if the pathologist sees the characteristic findings of ACD: misplaced pulmonary veins adjacent to pulmonary arteries, abnormal alveoli with thickened interstitia and abnormal capillary development. Due to the rapidly progressive course of ACD, this diagnosis is frequently made during autopsy. If ACD is suspected early, examination of tissue from lung biopsy results in the quickest diagnosis.[1] Genetic testing for FOXF1 is now available and can allow for slower but non-invasive diagnosis. As not all disease-causing mutations are known, false negatives or results of uncertain significance are possible with genetic testing.[2]\nThere are no characteristic pattern of routine lab results or imaging findings that allow definitive diagnosis of ACD.[1]",
    "Treatment": "Initial treatments attempt to improve low blood oxygenation and high pulmonary blood pressures. Because blood oxygen content is usually very low, babies with ACD are often intubated, sedated, and mechanically ventilated with pure oxygen. Pulmonary vasodilators like sildenafil or inhaled nitric oxide can be used to reduce pulmonary blood pressures.[6] For those with severe ACD, these measures offer only momentary improvement. As symptoms worsen, ECMO can be used, but it also offers only brief improvement. There are no effective treatments for severe ACD.[1]\nFor infants with atypical ACD who initially had milder symptoms and present at months of life, there can be better response to therapy. There have been reports of infants with ACD surviving to 20 or 36 months without lung transplantation. Bilateral lung transplantation may be the definitive treatment.[citation needed]",
    "Epidemiology": "ACD is a rare disease. As of 2011, about 100 cases had been reported. It is likely an under-recognized cause of death shortly after birth because diagnosis requires microscopic examination of lung tissue or specialized genetic testing, or death can be attributed to severe heart or intestinal congenital abnormalities which frequently occur in ACD.[1]"

    "Disease": "Ameloblastic carcinoma",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Common symptoms of ameloblastic carcinomas are pain and swelling either localized in the jaw or throughout the entire face, dysphagia, and trismus. Less common symptoms include ulceration, loosening of the teeth, chronic epistaxis, facial pressure, and nasal dyspnea.[3][4]",
    "Causes": "It is speculated that some cases of ameloblastic carcinoma arise from remnants of epithelial tissue left behind after the development of the teeth and related structures. Other times, it may be caused by a benign odontogenic cyst becoming malignant, or a pre-existing ameloblastoma.[5][2]",
    "Treatment": "Chemotherapy has not proven effective in treating ameloblastic carcinoma, leaving surgical removal of the tumor one of the only options.[6] Surgical resection with wide margins is the main treatment.[7]",
    "Prognosis": "Followup after surgery is important, as over 50% of recurrences occur within 5 years.[6]"

  {
    "Disease": "Aponeurotic fibroma",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Aponeurotic fibroma occurs most frequently in the fingers, palms, and soles of the distal extremities.[3] Typically, the tumor is defined as a smaller than 3 cm diameter, firm, non-tender mass that grows slowly. It is prone to infiltrate the surrounding tissue and, following surgical resection, is more likely to recur locally.[4]",
    "Diagnosis": "A histological examination is necessary to make a diagnosis.[5] Histologically, the tumor is characterized by fibroblast growth and calcification.[3]\nImaging results include edematous alterations and subcutaneous neoplastic tumors with hazy margins that appear to be encroaching on the surrounding tissues. The fascia and tendon sheath are next to the tumor. While T2WI displays heterogeneous signals, T1WI displays signals that are hypointense to isointense. Additionally, there is heterogeneous contrast enhancement.[6][7][8]",
    "Treatment": "The treatment of choice for an aponeurotic fibroma is surgical excision.[5]",
    "Epidemiology": "Aponeurotic fibroma is a rare tumor. The tumor often manifests in the first or second decade of life, while examples have been documented at birth and 67 years of age. Patients who are male are impacted twice as frequently as those who are female.[4]"

  {
    "Disease": "Aquagenic urticaria",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The main symptom of aquagenic urticaria is the development of physical hives, which may or may not itch. Itching after contact with water, without the development of physical hives, is known as aquagenic pruritus. Aquadynia is a condition in which pain occurs after contact with water.[2]\nIn severe cases, drinking water can result in swelling of the oral cavity,[3] swelling of the throat,[4] and in extreme cases, anaphylaxis.[5][6][7]\nThe hives associated with aquagenic urticaria are typically small (approximately 1–3 mm), red- or skin-colored welts (called wheals) with clearly defined edges. It most commonly develops on the neck, upper trunk and arms, although it can occur anywhere on the body.  Once the water source is removed, the rash generally fades within 30 to 60 minutes.[8]\nWater in all forms, such as tap or sea water, swimming pool water, sweat, tears, and saliva can induce the lesions.[9][10][11]",
    "Causes": "The cause of aquagenic urticaria is not fully understood; however, several mechanisms have been proposed.[12] Interaction between water and a component in or on the skin or sebum has been suggested. This theory suggests that a substance is formed by this interaction, the absorption of which causes perifollicular mast cell degranulation with release of histamine.[13][14] Another proposed theory is of a water-soluble allergen in the epithelial tissues. Water dissolves the allergen, causing it to diffuse into the tissues, causing histamine release from sensitized mast cells.[15][16]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis of aquagenic urticaria begins with a clinical history and water challenge test.[17] The water challenge test consists of application of a 35°C water compress to the upper body for 30 minutes. Water of any temperature can provoke aquagenic urticaria; however, keeping the compress at a similar temperature to that of the human body (37 °C) avoids confusion with cold urticaria or cholinergic urticaria. In addition, a forearm or hand can be immersed in water of varying temperatures to determine whether temperature is a factor in the patient's condition. Aquagenic urticaria differs from aquagenic pruritus, in which contact with water evokes intense itching without visible hives or rash.[18][19][20]\nOnce known as a separate, rare disease, aquagenic urticaria is now considered a subtype of general urticaria.[21] The first case was reported by Walter B Shelley et al. in 1964.[22] The condition is more common in women than men, and typically presents for the first time during puberty. Genetics may play a part, and the condition may be related to other sensitivities such as lactose intolerance.[23][24][25][26][27][13]",
    "Treatment": "Given the rarity of the disease, clinical efficacy data of treatments is limited. However, current recommendations suggest a trial of a second generation antihistamine up to four-times the standard dosing scheme for initial pharmacology. For patients who cannot be controlled on high dose antihistamines, other therapeutics, including biologics like omalizumab, have shown improvements in case reports.[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "Arthrogryposis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Often, every joint in a patient with arthrogryposis is  affected; in 84% all limbs are involved, in 11% only the legs, and in 4% only the arms are involved.[4] Every joint in the body, when affected, displays typical signs and symptoms:  for example, the shoulder (internal rotation); wrist (volar and ulnar); hand (fingers in fixed flexion and thumb in palm); hip (flexed, abducted and externally rotated, frequently dislocated); elbow (extension and pronation) and foot clubfoot and less commonly congenital vertical talus.[2][5]\nRange of motion can be different between joints because of the different deviations.[6] Some types of arthrogryposis like amyoplasia have a symmetrical joint/limb involvement, with normal sensations.[4][6] The contractures in the joints can result in delayed walking development in the first five years, but severity of contractures do not necessarily predict eventual walking ability or inability.[6]\nIntelligence is normal to above normal in children with amyoplasia,[4] but it is not known how many of these children have an above-normal intelligence, and there is no literature available about the cause of this syndrome. There are a few syndromes like the Freeman–Sheldon and Gordon syndrome, which have craniofacial involvement.[4] The amyoplasia form of arthrogryposis is sometimes accompanied with a midline facial hemangioma.[4]\nArthrogryposis is not a diagnosis but a clinical finding, so this disease is often accompanied with other syndromes or diseases. These other diagnoses could affect any organ in a patient. There are a few slightly more common diagnoses such as pulmonary hypoplasia, cryptorchidism, congenital heart defects, tracheoesophageal fistulas, inguinal hernias, cleft palate, and eye abnormalities.[7]",
    "Causes": "Research of arthrogryposis has shown that anything that inhibits normal joint movement before birth can result in joint contractures.[3]  Arthrogryposis could be caused by genetic and environmental factors. In principle: any factor that curtails fetal movement can result in congenital contractures.[4] The exact causes of arthrogryposis are unknown.\nThe malformations of arthrogryposis can be secondary to environmental factors such as: decreased intrauterine movement, oligohydramnios (low volume or abnormal distribution of intrauterine fluid), and defects in the fetal blood supply. Other causes could be: hyperthermia, limb immobilization and viral infections. A specific virus that may cause arthrogryposis is contraction of the Zika virus during pregnancy. Congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), may occur when there is vertical transmission of the Zika virus to the fetus.[8] Myasthenia gravis of the mother leads also in rare cases to arthrogryposis. The major cause in humans is fetal akinesia; however, this is disputed lately.[2]\nArthrogryposis could also be caused by intrinsic factors. This includes molecular, muscle- and connective tissue development disorders or neurological abnormalities.[3]\nResearch has shown that there are more than 35 specific genetic disorders associated with arthrogryposis. Most of those mutations are missense, which means the mutation results in a different amino acid. Other mutations that could cause arthrogryposis are: single gene defects (X-linked recessive, autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant), mitochondrial defects and chromosomal disorders (for example: trisomy 18).[4] This is mostly seen in distal arthrogryposis. Mutations in at least five genes (TNN12, TNNT3, TPM2, MYH3 and MYH8) could cause distal arthrogryposis.[3] There could be also connective tissue, neurological or muscle development disorders.[3]\nLoss of muscle mass with an imbalance of muscle power at the joint can lead to connective tissue abnormality.[2] This leads to joint fixation and reduced fetal movement.[2] Also muscle abnormalities could lead to a reduction of fetal movement.\nThose could be: dystrophy, myopathy and mitochondrial disorders. This is mostly the result of abnormal function of the dystrophin-glycoprotein-associated complex in the sarcolemma of skeletal muscles.[2]\nSeventy to eighty percent of cases of the most severe forms of arthrogryposis are caused by neurological abnormalities, which can be either genetic or environmental.[3]\nThe underlying aetiology and pathogenesis of congenital contractures, particularly arthrogryposis and the mechanism of the mutations remains an active area of investigation, because identifying these factors could help to develop treatment and congenital finding of arthrogryposis.[3][9]",
    "Diagnosis": "Research on prenatal diagnosis has shown that a diagnosis can be made prenatally in approximately 50% of fetuses presenting arthrogryposis.[10] It could be found during routine ultrasound scanning showing a lack of mobility and abnormal position of the foetus.[2] There are other options for visualization of details and structures using techniques such as 4D ultrasound.[2] In clinic a child can be diagnosed with arthrogryposis with physical examination, confirmed by ultrasound, MRI,[3][10] or muscle biopsy.[10]\nSome of the different types of AMC include:\nAnother form has been related to mutations in the leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 4 (LGI4) gene.[43]",
    "Treatment": "The treatment of arthrogryposis includes occupational therapy, physical therapy, splinting and surgery.[3] An approach that occupational therapists use is orthopedic management. Using casts in order to correct joint deformities can be very effective since the joints can be misaligned and present with deformities. Another vital intervention that occupational therapists use to treat arthrogryposis, is range of motion exercises. This is in order to increase joint mobility.[44] The primary long-term goals of these treatments are increasing joint mobility and muscle strength and the development of adaptive use patterns that allow for walking and independence with activities of daily living. Since arthrogryposis has many different types, the treatment varies between patients depending on the symptoms.[3]\nThere are a number of passive devices for enhancing limb movement, intended to be worn to aid movement and encourage muscular development. For example, the Wilmington Robotic Exoskeleton is a potential assistive device built on a back brace, shadowing the upper arm and forearm. It can be difficult to fit and heavy and awkward to wear.[45][46][47]\nResearchers at the University of Delaware are developing a light and unobtrusive therapeutic garment, suitable for babies and children, called the Playskin Lift. The garment looks like normal clothing but contains bundled steel wires under the arms, which help to push the arms toward a lifted position while allowing the wearer to move freely from that position.[47][48][49][50]\nChildren with the amyoplasia type of arthrogryposis usually have flexion and ulnar deviation of the wrists.[2] Dorsal carpal wedge osteotomy is indicated for wrists with excessive flexion contracture deformity when non-surgical interventions such as occupational therapy and splinting have failed to improve function. On the dorsal side, at the level of the midcarpus, a wedge osteotomy is made. Sufficient bone is resected to at least be able to put the wrist in a neutral position. If the wrist also has ulnar deviation, more bone can be taken from the radial side to correct this abnormality. This position is held into place with two cross K-wires. In addition, a tendon transfer of the extensor carpi ulnaris to the extensor carpi radialis brevis may be performed to correct ulnar deviation or wrist extension weakness, or both. This tendon transfer is only used if the extensor carpi ulnaris appears to be functional enough.[51]\nThe soft tissue envelope in congenital contractual conditions such as clasped or arthrogrypotic thumbs is often deficient in two planes, the thumb-index web and the flexor aspect of the thumb.  There is often an appearance of increased skin at the base of the index finger that is part of the deformity. This tissue can be used to resurface the thumb-index web after a comprehensive release of all the tight structures to allow for a larger range of motion of the thumb. This technique is called the index rotation flap.[52]\nThe flap is taken from the radial side of the index finger. It is proximally based at the distal edge of the thumb-index web. The flap is made as wide as possible, but still small enough to close with the excessive skin on the palmar side of the index finger. The flap is rotated around the tightest part of the thumb to the metacarpophalangeal joint of the thumb, allowing for a larger range of motion.[52]\nGenerally, foot surgery is usually reserved for patients with a walking or ambulatory potential. Foot surgery may also be indicated to assist brace and orthosis fitting and hence promote supported standing. The most common foot deformity in arthrogryposis is club feet or talipes equinovarus. In the early years of life the serial casting according to the Ponseti method usually yields good results. The Ponseti method can also be used as a first line treatment in older and more resistant cases.[53] In such severe and neglected cases bony surgery in the form of foot osteotomies and arthrodesis is usually indicated. It is usually accompanied by soft tissue surgery in the form of release of contracted tendon and capsular structures. In older patients near skeletal maturity joint fusion or arthrodesis may be indicated as well.[54] Less frequent patients with arthrogryposis may develop congenital vertical talus also known as rocker bottom foot. Similarly, congenital vertical talus is classically managed by serial casting according to the reversed Ponseti method. Resistant or recurrent cases may be offered an extensive soft tissue release. However this is fraught with risk of foot stiffness and pain in the long term. Talectomy or excision of the talus to give room for creation of plantigrade foot has been practiced. Naviculectomy or midtarsal resection arthroplasty represents a less invasive option with satisfactory short-term results.[55]",
    "Prognosis": "AMC is considered non-progressive, so with proper medical treatment things can improve. The joint contractures will not get worse than they are at the time of birth. There is no way to resolve or cure AMC completely but with proper treatment most children make significant improvements in their range of motion and ability to move their limbs, which enables them to carry out daily activities and live relatively normal lives.[citation needed]\nTherapeutic interventions that are cornerstones in the treatment of AMC include: stretching and range of motion exercises, physical, occupational and speech therapy, splinting and serial casting. Surgical intervention may also improve joint mobility and function.[56] Other positive prognostic factors for independent walking are active hips and knees, hip flexion contractures of less than 20 degrees and knee flexion contractures of less than 15 degrees without severe scoliosis.[6]",
    "Epidemiology": "Arthrogryposis is a rare condition. Some authors say the overall prevalence is one in 3,000[3] and others say it is one in 11,000–12,000 among European live births.[57] Congenital clubfoot is the most common single contracture and its prevalence is one in 500 live births.[3]"

    "Disease": "Aspartylglucosaminuria",
    "Signs and symptoms": "At birth, there is no sign that a child will develop symptoms of aspartylglucosaminuria. Typically, signs and symptoms become apparent between two and four years of age and become progressively worse as the individual ages. The following signs and symptoms  may appear:[3]\n(Children are physically uncoordinated, but remain able to play sports and do everyday activities until they reach adulthood.)",
    "Diagnosis": "In order to be diagnosed with AGU an individual takes a urine test, which will show indication of an increased amount of aspartylglucosamin being secreted. The confirmation of the diagnosis of aspartylglucosaminuria requires a blood test. This helps show if the enzyme aspartylglucosaminidase is present or partially absent. A skin sample will also show the amount of aspartylglucosaminidase present.[4]\nWhen families have a child who has already been diagnosed with AGU, they have the option to observe the enzyme's activity that codes for AGU in future pregnancy, to help determine if the next child will also have a positive diagnosis for aspartylglucosaminuria.[2]",
    "Treatment": "No treatment is available to cure or slow down the progression of aspartylglucosaminuria. Bone marrow transplants have been conducted in hope that the bone marrow will produce the missing enzyme. The results of the tests thus far have shown to be inconclusive.[2]\nIt will be beneficial to children who are diagnosed with AGU to receive an education from a school with special teaching.[4]\nThe process of habilitation for individuals diagnosed with AGU needs to be established in their early stages of life. The team for habilitation should include professionals who are experienced in disabilities and the effects that having a disability can have on everyday life. Habilitation will include assessments, assistance with the choice of aids, and information concerning disabilities and counseling.[4]",
    "Prognosis": "Individuals with AGU typically have normal development in infancy. Around the age of 2–4 years, they begin showing signs of developmental delay, but development is still progressing. Initial symptoms may present as clumsiness and/or speech delay. Individuals with AGU also show increased upper respiratory infections. Development continues until about puberty; however, an individual at 13–16 years of age typically shows mental and motor development similar to a 5-6 year old. Around puberty, a gradual decline in mental abilities and motor skills occurs. This progressive decline continues until about age 25–28, when rapid impairment of abilities occurs, resulting in severe intellectual disability.[4]",
    "Epidemiology": "Aspartylglucosaminuria is estimated to affect 1 in 18,500 people in Finland. This condition is less common in other countries, but the incidence is unknown.[5] Even though this disease can occur in various races and ethnicities, another study  backed this finding up by stating that 1 in 26,000 people in Finland had the disease and that 1 in 18,000 were carriers.[3]\nAfter trisomy 21 and fragile X syndrome, this is the most frequent multiple congenital anomaly/intellectual disability syndrome in Finland.[7]"

    "Disease": "Athetoid cerebral palsy",
    "Causes": "Dyskinetic cerebral palsy could have multiple causes. The majority of the children are born at term and experience perinatal adverse events which can be supported by neuroimaging. Possible causes are perinatal hypoxic-ischaemia and neonatal shock in children born at term or near term. Hyperbilirubinaemia used to be a common contributing factor,[16] but is now rare in high-income countries due to preventive actions. Other aetiological factors are growth retardation,[17] brain maldevelopment, intracranial haemorrhage, stroke or cerebral infections.[8]\nCP in general is a non-progressive, neurological condition that results from brain injury and malformation occurring before cerebral development is complete.[3] ADCP is associated with injury and malformations to the extrapyramidal tracts in the basal ganglia or the cerebellum.[7] Lesions to this region principally arise via hypoxic ischemic brain injury or bilirubin encephalopathy.[7]\nHypoxic-ischemic brain injury is a form of cerebral hypoxia in which oxygen cannot perfuse to cells in the brain. Lesions in the putamen and thalamus caused by this type of brain injury are primary causes of ADCP and can occur during the prenatal period and shortly after.[7] Lesions that arise after this period typically occur as a result of injury or infections of the brain.[18]\nBilirubin encephalopathy, also known as kernicterus, is the accumulation of bilirubin in the grey matter of the central nervous system. The main accumulation targets of hyperbilirubinemia are the basal ganglia, ocular movement nucleus, and acoustic nucleus of the brainstem.[7] Pathogenesis of bilirubin encephalopathy involves several factors, including the transport of bilirubin across the blood–brain barrier and into neurons.[7] Mild disruption results in left cognition impairment, while severe disruption results in ADCP.[7] Lesions caused by accumulation of bilirubin occur mainly in the global pallidus and hypothalamus.[7] Disruption of the blood–brain barrier by disease or a hypoxic ischemic injury can also contribute to an accumulation of bilirubin in the brain.[7] Bilirubin encephalopathy leading to cerebral palsy has been greatly reduced by effective monitoring and treatment for hyperbilirubinemia in preterm infants.[7]  As kernicterus has decreased due to improvements in care, over the last 50 years the proportion of children developing athetoid CP has decreased.[19] In most cases, will have normal intelligence.",
    "Diagnosis": "Cerebral palsies have historically been diagnosed based on parental reporting of developmental motor delays such as failure to sit upright, reach for objects, crawl, stand, or walk at the appropriate age.[5] Diagnosis of ADCP is also based on clinical assessment used in conjunction with milestone reporting.[4] The majority of ADCP assessments now use the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) or the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (formerly the International Classification of Impairments Disease, and Handicaps), measures of motor impairment that are effective in assessing severe CP.[7][4]\nThe Barry-Albright Dystonia Rating Scale (BADS), the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMS) and the Dyskinesia Impairment Scale (DIS) are also commonly used to categorize clinical qualitative assessments of dyskinesia in DCP.[20][21][22]\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to detect morphological brain abnormalities associated with ADCP in patients that are either at risk for ADCP or have shown symptoms thereof.[6] The abnormalities chiefly associated with ADCP are lesions that appear in the basal ganglia.[6] The severity of the disease is proportional to the severity and extent of these abnormalities, and is typically greater when additional lesions appear elsewhere in the deep grey matter or white matter.[6] MRI also has the ability to detect brain malformation, periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), and areas affected by hypoxia-ischemia, all of which may play a role in the development of ADCP.[4] The MRI detection rate for ADCP is approximately 54.5%, however this statistic varies depending on the patient's age and the cause of the disease and has been reported to be significantly higher.[7]\nMultiple classification systems using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been developed, linking brain lesions to time of birth, cerebral palsy subtype and functional ability.[23][24][25][26]\nAround 70% of patients with DCP show lesions in the cortical and deep grey matter of the brain, more specifically in the basal ganglia and thalamus. However, other brain lesions and even normal-appearing MRI findings can occur, for example white matter lesions and brain maldevelopments.[2][25][27][28] Patients with pure basal ganglia and thalamus lesions are more likely to show more severe choreoathetosis whereas dystonia may be associated with other brain lesions, such as the cerebellum.[2] These lesions occur mostly during the peri- and postnatal period since these regions have a high vulnerability during the late third trimester of the pregnancy.[29] Unfortunately, contemporary imaging is not sophisticated enough to detect all subtle brain deformities and network disorders in dystonia. Research with more refined imaging techniques including diffusion tensor imaging and functional MRI is required.[10][30]\nMovement and posture limitations are aspects of all CP types and as a result, CP has historically been diagnosed based on parental reporting of developmental motor delays such as failure to sit upright, reach for objects, crawl, stand, or walk at the appropriate age.[5] Diagnosis of ADCP is also based on clinical assessment used in conjunction with milestone reporting.[4] The majority of ADCP assessments now use the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) or the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (formerly the International Classification of Impairments Disease, and Handicaps), measures of motor impairment that are effective in assessing severe CP.[7][4] ADCP is typically characterized by an individual's inability to control their muscle tone, which is readily assessed via these classification systems.[7][4]",
    "Treatment": "Dyskinetic cerebral palsy is a non-progressive, irreversible disease. The current management is symptomatic, since there is no cure. The main goal is to improve daily activity, quality of life and autonomy of the children by creating a timed and targeted management. The many management options for patients with DCP are not appropriate as standalone treatment but must be seen within an individualized multidisciplinary rehabilitation program.\nMedical treatment consists of oral medication and surgery. Before using oral drugs, it is important to differentiate between spasticity, dystonia, and choreoathetosis since each motor disorder has a specific approach. In general, many oral drugs have low efficacy, unwanted side-effects and variable effects.[35]\nOrthopedic surgery is performed to correct musculoskeletal deformities, but it is recommended that all other alternatives are considered first.[10]\nThe previous management options need to be combined with rehabilitation programs, adapted to the specific needs of each individual. Typically, the team of caregivers can consist of physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech/communication therapists. The therapy mainly focusses on the motor problems by using principles of neuroplasticity, patterning, postural balance, muscle strengthening and stretching.[36] Non-motor impairments such as epilepsy require specific treatment.\nPhysical therapy and Occupational Therapy are staple treatments of ADCP.  Physical therapy is initiated soon after diagnosis and typically focuses on trunk strength and maintaining posture.[7]  Physical therapy helps to improve mobility, range of motion, functional ability, and quality of life.  Specific exercises and activities prescribed by a therapist help to prevent muscles from deteriorating or becoming locked in position and help to improve coordination.[37]\nSpeech impairment is common in ADCP patients.[4][3] Speech therapy is the treatment of communication diseases, including disorders in speech production, pitch, intonation, respiration and respiratory disorders.  Exercises advised by a speech therapist or speech-language pathologist help patients to improve oral motor skills, restore speech, improve listening skills, and use communication aids or sign language if necessary.[37]\nOral baclofen and trihexyphenidyl are commonly used to decrease dystonia, although its efficacy is relatively low in most patients. Adverse effects of the latter can include worsening of choreoathetosis.[10] Since dystonia predominates over choreoathetosis in most patients, reducing dystonia allows the possibility of a full expression of choreoathetosis. This suggests that the discrimination of dystonia and choreoathetosis is crucial, since misinterpretations in diagnosing can contribute to the administration of inappropriate medication, causing unwanted effects.[10][38] Intrathecal baclofen pumps (ITB) are often used as an alternative to reduce side-effects of the oral dystonic medication over the whole body.[39] Botulinum toxin injections may be applied to decrease dystonia in specific muscles or muscle groups.[10][36][40]\nMedications that impede the release of excitatory neurotransmitters have been used to control or prevent spasms.[41] Treatment with intrathecal baclofen, a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist, decreases muscle tone and has been shown to decrease the frequency of muscle spasms in ADCP patients.[41] Tetrabenazine, a drug commonly used in the treatment of Huntington's disease, has been shown to be effective treating chorea.[41]\nDeep brain stimulation (DBS) is a technique that uses electrodes placed in the brain to modify brain activity by sending a constant electrical signal to the nearby nuclei.[41] Treatment of muscle tone issues via deep brain stimulation typically targets the global pallidus and has shown to significantly improve symptoms associated with ADCP.[41] The specific mechanism by which DBS affects ADCP is unclear.[41]  DBS of the globus pallidus interna improves dystonia in people with dyskinetic CP in 40% of cases, perhaps due to variation in basal ganglia injuries.[42]\nDBS in patients with DCP has shown to decrease dystonia.[43][44] However, the responsiveness is less beneficial and the effects are more variable than in patients with inherited or primary dystonia.[45] The effects on choreoathetosis have not been investigated.",
    "Prognosis": "The severity of impairment and related prognosis is dependent on the location and severity of brain lesions.[7] Up to 75% of patients will achieve some degree of ambulation.[3] Speech problems, such as dysarthria, are common to these patients.[3]",
    "Epidemiology": "Dyskinetic cerebral palsy is the second most common subtype of cerebral palsy after spastic CP. A European Cerebral Palsy study reported a rate of 14.4% of patients with DCP[46] which is similar to the rate of 15% reported in Sweden.[47] The rate appeared lower in Australia, where data from states with full population-based ascertainment listed DCP as the predominant motor type in only 7% of the cases.[48] The differences reported from various registers and countries may relate to under-identification of dyskinetic CP due to a lack of standardization in definition and classification based on predominant type.[49][11]"

    "Disease": "Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Clinical signs and symptoms of complement-mediated TMA can include abdominal pain,[9] confusion,[9] fatigue,[5] edema (swelling),[10] nausea/vomiting[11] and diarrhea.[12]  aHUS often presents with malaise and fatigue, as well as microangiopathic anemia.[8]: 1931  However, severe abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea are unusual.[8]: 1931   Laboratory tests may also reveal low levels of platelets (cells in the blood that aid in clotting),[1] elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, a chemical released from damaged cells, and which is therefore a marker of cellular damage),[7] decreased haptoglobin (indicative of the breakdown of red blood cells),[7] anemia (low red blood cell count)/schistocytes (damaged red blood cells),[1][7] elevated creatinine (indicative of kidney dysfunction),[13] and proteinuria (indicative of kidney injury).[14] Patients with aHUS often present with an abrupt onset of systemic signs and symptoms such as acute kidney failure,[1] hypertension (high blood pressure),[5] myocardial infarction (heart attack),[15] stroke,[9] lung complications,[15] pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas),[11] liver necrosis (death of liver cells or tissue),[5] encephalopathy (brain dysfunction),[5] seizure,[16] or coma.[17] Failure of neurologic, cardiac, kidney, and gastrointestinal (GI) organs, as well as death, can occur unpredictably at any time, either very quickly or following prolonged symptomatic or asymptomatic disease progression.[1][14][18][19][20] For example, approximately 1 in 6 patients with aHUS will initially present with proteinuria or hematuria without acute kidney failure.[14] Patients who survive the presenting signs and symptoms endure a chronic thrombotic and inflammatory state, which puts many of them at lifelong elevated risk of sudden blood clotting, kidney failure, other severe complications and premature death.[10][21]\nAlthough many patients experience aHUS as a single disease, comorbidities are common. In one study, 25% (47/191) of patients with no known family history of aHUS were found to have a coexisting disease or condition. Comorbidities in this study included malignant hypertension (30%), TMA with a history of transplant (23%), TMA associated with pregnancy (21%), glomerulopathy (17%), systemic disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS) (6%), and malignancy (1%).[5] The presence of mutations in complement regulatory proteins, or of disease-associated variations in the genes encoding these proteins (i.e., in most patients with comorbid conditions as well as in patients with aHUS as a single disease), suggests that deviations from the normal genetic coding of these factors could result in a genetic predisposition to TMA. Individuals so predisposed could have aHUS episodes precipitated by one of the known disease triggers (e.g., infection, pregnancy, surgery, trauma) as well as by other systemic diseases (e.g., malignant hypertension, SLE, cancer).[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "aHUS is not the only condition that causes systemic TMA, a fact that makes differential diagnosis essential. Historically, the clinical diagnosis of TMA-causing diseases was grouped into a broad category that (in addition to aHUS) included thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli hemolytic uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS).[19][21] However, it is now understood that although aHUS, STEC-HUS, and TTP have similar clinical presentations, they have distinct causes and specific tests can be conducted to differentiate these diseases. In addition, there are other conditions that can cause TMA as a secondary manifestation; these entities include systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), malignant hypertension, progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS, also known as scleroderma), pregnancy-associated HELLP (hemolysis, liver dysfunction, and low platelets) syndrome, and toxic drug reactions (e.g., to cocaine, cyclosporine, or tacrolimus). Nevertheless, aHUS should be suspected in patients presenting with systemic TMA, and appropriate diagnostic work-up should be undertaken.[citation needed]\nThe neurological and kidney-related signs and symptoms of aHUS overlap with those of TTP.[13][23] However, unlike aHUS, TTP is primarily an autoimmune disorder in which the presence of an inhibitory autoantibody results in severe deficiency of ADAMTS13, an enzyme that cleaves von Willebrand factor (vWF, a large protein involved in blood clotting) into smaller pieces.[22] TTP also can be a genetic disorder characterized by mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene leading to severe ADAMTS13 deficiency. This congenital cause of ADAMTS13 deficiency is called Upshaw-Schulman syndrome.[24]) A lab test showing ADAMTS13 activity levels of ≤5% is indicative of TTP.[22]\nSimilarly, the gastrointestinal (GI) signs and symptoms of aHUS overlap with those of STEC-HUS.[12][25][26] Stool samples from patients with diarrhea or other GI symptoms should be tested for STEC and the presence of Shiga-toxin. However, a positive identification of Shiga-toxin, which is required to diagnose STEC-HUS, does not rule out aHUS. Nevertheless, in the appropriate clinical setting, a positive identification of Shiga-toxin makes aHUS very unlikely.[13][26]\naHUS patients report a mean timeline of 29 days for the overall diagnosis process from first noticing symptoms to receiving an aHUS diagnosis. During this time, they report an overall health state drop – from 88% of patients falling between good and excellent, to 99% falling between good and very poor – and a decrease in health status index by more than half – from 3.8 (on a scale of 1 to 5) pre-illness, to 1.4 at diagnosis.[27]",
    "Treatment": "Although plasma exchange/infusion (PE/PI) is frequently used, there are no controlled trials of its safety or efficacy in aHUS. Even though PE/PI often partially controls some of the hematological manifestations of aHUS in some patients, its effectiveness has not been demonstrated in terms of inducing total disease remission.  PE/PI is associated with significant safety risks, including risk of infection, allergic reactions, thrombosis, loss of vascular access, and poor quality of life.[23][28] Importantly, terminal complement activation has been shown to be chronically present on the surface of platelets in patients with aHUS who appear to be clinically well while receiving chronic PE/PI.[10][29]\nGuidelines issued by the European Paediatric Study Group for HUS recommend rapid administration of plasma exchange or plasma infusion (PE/PI), intensively administered daily for 5 days and then with reducing frequency.[23] However, the American Society for Apheresis offers a \"weak\" recommendation for plasma exchange to treat aHUS, due to the \"low\" or \"very low\" quality of evidence supporting its use. Although some patients experienced improvements in red blood cell and platelet counts, plasma therapies generally did not result in full remission.[30]\nEculizumab (Soliris) appears to be useful for atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS).[31] In September 2011 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved it as an orphan drug to treat people with aHUS.[32] This approval was based on two small prospective trials of 17 people and 20 people.[31] In the UK, NICE issued guidance on the use of Eculizumab for treating aHUS, based on five evidence sources, including those used by the FDA[33] No randomised controlled trials were identified. All prospective studies were phase 2, open‑label, non‑randomised, single‑arm studies that included patients with different clinical baseline characteristics. The prospective studies lasted 26 weeks; however, patients were allowed to continue treatment with eculizumab in a long‑term extension study.[citation needed]\nRavulizumab-cwvz (Ultomiris) is a second generation monoclonal antibody for aHUS made by Alexion pharmaceuticals, Inc.[34] The target of ravulizumab-cwvz is the same eculizumab (Soliris) with changes to the structure of the antibody resulting in a longer serum half life and therefore reduced dosing regimen.[35]\nPatients with aHUS who have ESRD are generally consigned to lifelong dialysis, which carries a 5-year survival rate of 34–38%,[36][37] with infections accounting for 14% of deaths.[38] These patients also remain at ongoing risk of non-kidney systemic complications of the disease.[citation needed]\nDespite its history of use in patients with aHUS, kidney transplantation does not address the continued and uncontrolled complement activation that leads to progressive, systemic TMA. As many as 90% of patients with aHUS and who are not treated with Soliris or Ultomiris, experience TMA in the transplanted organ, leading to transplant failure.[12][39] Patients who have undergone kidney transplantation are still at continued risk of neurological, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular complications and, importantly, premature mortality. Following kidney transplantation, the ongoing, uncontrolled, chronic complement activation associated with aHUS causes graft loss in 66% of children and 55% of adults, as well as continued inflammatory and TMA insult to other organs.[1][5] Combined liver-kidney transplantation is only available to very few patients, due to the limited supply of solid organs. In addition, there is a substantial near-term risk of mortality, which many physicians and patients consider excessive.[1] In recent years, some transplant centers have begun to administer eculizumab to patients with TMA who receive a kidney transplant. This strategy has been effective in preventing TMA recurrences in these patients.[40]\nPatients using either eculizumab or ravulizumab for the treatment of aHUS showed improvements in kidney function even avoiding dialysis and minimizing death. Markers of disease activity in the blood also had a great improvement. However, the only available evidence has substantial bias and low quality and therefore there should be careful considerations for futures studies in treatment duration, adverse outcomes and risk of disease recurrence associated with this treatment.[41]",
    "Prognosis": "Prior to the use of monoclonal antibodies(e.g., Soliris, Ultomiris) patients with aHUS had an extremely poor prognosis. Among those with the most commonly identified aHUS genetic mutation, the proportion of patients experiencing negative outcomes (e.g., need for dialysis, permanent kidney damage, death) within the first year rose to 70%.[7] However, sudden morbidity and mortality could occur regardless of mutational status. aHUS can arise at any age, with more than 40% of cases first reported after 18 years of age.[5] The oldest presentation in one study was at age 83.[5] As noted above, kidney transplantation for aHUS patients with ESRD was rarely considered because of a high incidence of graft loss due to TMA recurrence in the transplanted organ in up to 90% of patients.[12][39] Consequently, most untreated aHUS patients develop ESRD and undergo chronic dialysis, which is associated with significant morbidities and worsened prognosis.[12] Combined liver-kidney transplantation has been attempted in patients with aHUS, although this high-risk procedure has a mortality rate approaching 50%.[42]\nPrior to availability and usage of the treatments,  quality of life was very poor for patients with aHUS; burdened with fatigue, renal complications, hypertension, neurological impairment, gastrointestinal distress, clotting at the site of venous access, and in worst cases, death.[7] PE/PI is also reported to be associated with significant safety risks and is highly disruptive to patients' lives due to the requirements for extensive vascular access and frequent administration.[13][43]\nSince the approval of eculizumab (Soliris) the prognosis for aHUS patients has improved greatly.[44] Risk of relapse is present after discontinuation of eculizumab treatment and close monitoring is required.[44]",
    "Epidemiology": "aHUS can be inherited or acquired, and does not appear to vary by race, gender, or geographic area.[18] As expected with an ultra-rare disease, data on the prevalence of aHUS are extremely limited. A pediatric prevalence of 3.3 cases per million population is documented in one publication of a European hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) registry involving 167 pediatric patients.[45] Of aHUS cases, approximately 60 percent have genetically inherited aHUS.[46]",
    "Society and culture": "Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) has also been referred to as diarrhea-negative hemolytic-uremic syndrome (D− HUS).[47]: 2170\nPatient advocacy groups have been helping to determine research priorities.[48]"

    "Disease": "Atypical trigeminal neuralgia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "ATN pain can be described as heavy, aching, stabbing, and burning. Some patients have a constant migraine-like headache.  Others may experience intense pain in one or in all three trigeminal nerve branches, affecting teeth, ears, sinuses, cheeks, forehead,  upper and lower jaws, behind the eyes, and scalp. In addition, those with ATN may also experience the shocks or stabs found in type 1 TN.[citation needed]\nMany TN and ATN patients have pain that is \"triggered\" by light touch on shifting trigger zones. ATN pain tends to worsen with talking, smiling, chewing, or in response to sensations such as a cool breeze. The pain from ATN is often continuous, and periods of remission are rare. Both TN and ATN can be bilateral, though the character of pain is usually different on the two sides at any one time.[2]",
    "Causes": "ATN is usually attributed to inflammation or demyelination, with increased sensitivity of the trigeminal nerve. These effects are believed to be caused by infection, demyelinating diseases, or compression of the trigeminal nerve (by an impinging vein or artery, a tumor, dental trauma, accidents, or arteriovenous malformation) and are often confused with dental problems. Though TN and ATN most often present in the fifth decade, cases have been documented as early as infancy.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis for ATN is more difficult and complex than typical TN. However, the diagnosis for ATN can be supported by a positive response to a low dose of tricyclic antidepressant medications (such as amitriptyline or nortriptyline), similar to neuropathic pain diagnoses.[citation needed][14]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment of people believed to have ATN or TN is usually begun with medication.  The long-time first drug of choice for facial neuralgia has been carbamazepine, an anti-seizure agent. Due to the significant side-effects and hazards of this drug, others have recently come into common use as alternatives. These include oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, and gabapentin.  A positive patient response to one of these medications might be considered as supporting evidence for the diagnosis, which is otherwise made from medical history and pain presentation.  There are no present medical tests to conclusively confirm TN or ATN.[citation needed]\nIf the anti-seizure drugs are found ineffective, one of the tricyclic antidepressant medications, such as amitriptyline or nortriptyline, may be used. The tricyclic antidepressants are known to have dual action against both depression and neuropathic pain.  Other drugs which may also be tried, either individually or in combination with an anti-seizure agent, include baclofen, pregabalin, and opioid drugs such as oxycodone or an oxycodone/paracetamol combination.[citation needed]\nFor some people with ATN opioids may represent the only viable medical option which preserves quality of life and personal functioning.  Although there is considerable controversy in public policy and practice in this branch of medicine, practice guidelines have long been available and published.[15][16][17]\nIf drug treatment is found to be ineffective or causes disabling side effects, one of several neurosurgical procedures may be considered. The available procedures are believed to be less effective with type II (atypical) trigeminal neuralgia than with type I (typical or \"classic\") TN. Among present procedures, the most effective and long lasting has been found to be microvascular decompression (MVD), which seeks to relieve direct compression of the trigeminal nerve by separating and padding blood vessels in the vicinity of the emergence of this nerve from the brain stem, below the cranium.[18]\nChoice of a surgical procedure is made by the doctor and patient in consultation, based on the patient's pain presentation and health and the doctor's medical experience.  Some neurosurgeons resist the application of MVD or other surgeries to atypical trigeminal neuralgia, in light of a widespread perception that ATN pain is less responsive to these procedures.  However, recent papers suggest that in cases where pain initially presents as type I TN, surgery may be effective even after the pain has evolved into type II.[19]"

    "Disease": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "ADPKD can result in a wide variety of clinical symptoms. Symptoms may be caused directly by a cyst growing or bursting, or indirectly due to problems with other physiological functions. Most symptoms occur around 40 years of age, but some clinical symptoms can occur decades prior to the development of over kidney disease, with some symptoms presenting as early as childhood.[11][12]\nPrimary Symptoms Include:[12]\nAmong the most common symptoms associated with it is early-onset hypertension. Early-onset hypertension is present in 50%-70% of individuals with ADPKD.[11] Hypertension can even develop before the decline in kidney function markers like GFR (glomerular filtration rate).[11]\nThe presence of ADPKD is associated with several extra-renal symptoms, including the development of cysts in organs outside of the kidney. Polycystic liver disease is often found in adults with ADPKD and can be present in greater than 90% of individuals with ADPKD over 35 years old.[13] Polycystic liver disease develops more often in females with ADPKD than males, with risk factors including and exposure to non-endogenous sources of estrogen and multiple gestations. Individuals with polycystic liver disease due to ADPKD can also experience gastrointestinal symptoms related to the presence of cysts in the liver, such as early discomfort, fullness, and gastroesophageal reflux. In rare cases, portal hypertension with secondary ascites and pleural effusion can also occur.\nIndividuals with ADPKD are also at increased risk for developing intracranial aneurysms. The risk of intracranial aneurysms is estimated to be four times higher in people with ADPKD when compared to the general population, and as a result, screening with magnetic resonance angiography is recommended for high-risk populations.[13]\nAdditionally, symptoms such as abdominal fullness, excessive urination, and recurring urinary tract infections (occurring more frequently in women than in men), kidney stones, and bladder infection are also associated with ADPKD.[11]\nADPKD can also result in a wide array of symptoms beyond the kidneys, resulting in the following symptoms:[11][13]\nAmong the clinical presentation are:[citation needed]\nSigns and symptoms of ADPKD often develop between 30 and 40 years of age.[14]",
    "Diagnosis": "Usually, the diagnosis of ADPKD is initially performed by renal imaging using ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI.[37] However, molecular diagnostics can be necessary in the following situations: 1- when a definite diagnosis is required in young individuals, such as a potential living related donor in an affected family with equivocal imaging data;[37] 2- in patients with a negative family history of ADPKD, because of potential phenotypic overlap with several other kidney cystic diseases;[37] 3- in families affected by early-onset polycystic kidney disease, since in this cases hypomorphic alleles and/or oligogenic inheritance can be involved;[37][38] and 4- in patients requesting genetic counseling, especially in couples wishing a pre-implantation genetic diagnosis.[37][39]\nThe findings of large echogenic kidneys without distinct macroscopic cysts in an infant/child at 50% risk for ADPKD are diagnostic. In the absence of a family history of ADPKD, the presence of bilateral renal enlargement and cysts, with or without the presence of hepatic cysts, and the absence of other manifestations suggestive of a different renal cystic disease provides presumptively, but not definitively, evidence for the diagnosis. In some cases, intracranial aneurysms can be an associated sign of ADPKD, and screening can be recommended for patients with a family history of intracranial aneurysms.[40]\nMolecular genetic testing by linkage analysis or direct mutation screening is clinically available; however, genetic heterogeneity is a significant complication to molecular genetic testing. Sometimes, a relatively large number of affected family members need to be tested in order to establish which one of the two possible genes is responsible within each family. The large size and complexity of PKD1 and PKD2 genes, as well as marked allelic heterogeneity, present obstacles to molecular testing by direct DNA analysis. The sensitivity of testing is nearly 100% for all patients with ADPKD who are age 30 years or older and for younger patients with PKD1 mutations; these criteria are only 67% sensitive for patients with PKD2 mutations who are younger than age 30.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Currently, the only pharmacological treatment available for ADPKD consists of reducing the rate of gain of total kidney volume (TKV) with vasopressin receptor 2 (V2) antagonists (i.e., tolvaptan).[41] Tolvaptan treatment does not halt or reverse disease progression, and patients still progress towards renal failure.  Palliative treatment modalities involve symptomatic medications (nonopioid and opioid analgesics) for abdominal/retroperitoneal pain. Options for analgesic-resistant pain include simple or complex surgical procedures (i.e., renal cyst aspiration, cyst decortication, renal denervation, and nephrectomy), which can result in complications inherent to surgery.[citation needed] Recent research suggests that ketogenic dietary interventions beneficially affect the progression and symptoms in individuals with ADPKD.[42]  Mild weight loss favorably affects pain[43] indicating the benefit of dietary and lifestyle changes.\nIn 2014, Japan was the first country in the world to approve a pharmacological treatment for ADPKD[36] followed by Canada and Europe, which approved the drug tolvaptan for ADPKD patients at the beginning of 2015.  The USA FDA approved the use of tolvaptan in the treatment of ADPKD in 2018.[44] Tolvaptan, an aquaretic drug, is a vasopressin receptor 2 (V2) antagonist.[9] Pre-clinical studies had suggested that the molecule cAMP could be involved in the enlargement of ADPKD cysts,[45] and studies on rodents confirmed the role of vasopressin in increasing the levels of cAMP in the kidney, which laid the basis for the conduction of clinical studies.[46] Because data from the Consortium for Radiologic Imaging Studies of Polycystic Kidney Disease (CRISP) led by Mayo Clinic showed that total kidney volume (TKV) predicted the risk of developing chronic kidney disease in patients with ADPKD,[36][47] the TEMPO 3:4 trial, which enrolled patients from 129 sites worldwide from 2007 to 2009, evaluated TKV as a primary end-point to test the efficacy of tolvaptan in ADPKD patients.[9][10] That study showed a significant decrease in the ratio of TKV increase and deterring of renal function decline in ADPKD patients after treatment with tolvaptan;[9][48] however, because laboratory test results regarding liver function appeared elevated in a percentage of patients enrolled in that study, the approval of the drug was either delayed by regulatory agencies or, as in case of the US, altogether denied.[10][49]\nResearch using ADPKD mouse models showed that mild food restriction strongly improved disease progression.[50] The mechanism was shown to involve the metabolic state of ketosis, and beneficial effects could be produced by time-restricted feeding, acute fasting, a ketogenic diet, or by supplementation with the ketone beta-hydroxybutyrate in mouse, rat and cat models of ADPKD.[51][52]  A ketogenic diet regimen not only halted further disease progression but led to partial reversal of renal cystic disease in a rat model.[52] The metabolic state of ketosis may be beneficial in ADPKD because renal cyst cells in ADPKD have a metabolic defect similar to the Warburg effect in cancer that makes them highly dependent on glucose, and unable to metabolize fatty acids and ketones.[51][53][54] Consistent with this, serum glucose levels positively correlate with faster disease progression in ADPKD patients.[55] Also, individuals with ADPKD and type 2 diabetes have significantly larger total kidney volume (TKV) than those with ADPKD alone,[56] and overweight or obesity associate with faster progression in early-stage ADPKD.[57] A retrospective case series study showed that ADPKD disease symptoms - including pain, hypertension and renal function - improved among 131 patients who implemented ketogenic diets for an average duration of 6 months.[42]\nDietary intake of sodium is associated with worse renal function decline in ADPKD,[58] and limiting sodium intake is generally recommended to patients. Dietary protein intake was not found to correlate with ADPKD progression.[59]\nIncreased water intake is thought to be beneficial in ADPKD and is generally recommended.[60][61] The underlying beneficial mechanism of increased water intake may be related to effects on the vasopressin V2 receptor or may be due to the suppression of harmful micro-crystal formation in renal tubules by dilution of solutes such as calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, and uric acid.[60][62]\nDietary intake of oxalate or inorganic phosphate has been shown to accelerate PKD disease progression in several rodent models.[60] Low levels, or urinary citrate – a natural antagonist of the formation of harmful crystals in kidney tubules – have been shown to associate with worse disease progression in ADPKD patients.[60]\nChronic pain in patients with ADPKD is often refractory to conservative, noninvasive treatments, but nonopioid analgesics and conservative interventions can be first used before opioid analgesics are considered; if pain continues, then surgical interventions can target renal or hepatic cysts to directly address the cause of pain, with surgical options including renal cyst decortication, renal denervation, and nephrectomy.[63]\nAspiration with ethanol sclerotherapy can be performed for the treatment of symptomatic simple renal cysts, but can be impractical in advanced patients with multiple cysts.[64] The procedure itself consists in the percutaneous insertion of a needle into the identified cyst, under ultrasound guidance, with subsequent draining the contained liquid; the sclerotherapy is used to avoid liquid reaccumulation that can occur in the cyst, which can result in symptom recurrence.[64][65]\nLaparoscopic cyst decortication (also referred to as marsupialization) consists of the removal of one or more kidney cysts through laparoscopic surgery, during which cysts are punctured, and the outer wall of the larger cysts is excised with care not to incise the renal parenchyma.[66][67] This procedure can be useful for pain relief in patients with ADPKD, and is usually indicated after earlier cyst aspiration has confirmed that the cyst to be decorticated is responsible for pain.[67]\nNonrandomised controlled trials conducted in the '90s showed that patients with symptomatic simple renal cysts who had recurrence of symptoms after initial response to simple aspiration could be safely submitted to cyst decortication, with a mean pain-free life between 17 and 24 months after surgery.[66][68] Laparoscopic decortication presents a 5% recurrence rate of renal cysts compared to an 82% recurrence rate obtained with sclerotherapy.[65]\nA novel treatment of specifically the chronic pain experienced by many with ADPKD is Celiac plexus neurolysis.[69][70]  This involves the chemical ablation of the celiac plexus, to cause a temporary degeneration of targeted nerve fibers. When the nerve fibers degenerate, it causes an interruption in the transmission of nerve signals.  This treatment, when successful, provides significant pain relief for a period ranging from a few days to over a year.  The procedure may be repeated when the affected nerves have healed and the pain returns.[71]\nMany ADPKD patients experience symptomatic sequelae in consequence of the disease, such as cyst hemorrhage, flank pain, recurrent infections, nephrolithiasis, and symptoms of mass effect (i.e., early satiety, nausea and vomiting, and abdominal discomfort), from their enlarged kidneys.[72][73][74] In such cases, nephrectomy can be required due to intractable symptoms or when in the course of preparing for kidney transplantation, the native kidneys are found to impinge upon the true pelvis and preclude the placement of a donor allograft.[73][74][75][76] Additionally, native nephrectomy may be undertaken in the presence of suspected malignancy, as renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is two to three times more likely in the ADPKD population in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) than in the ESKD patients without ADPKD.[74][77] Although the indications for nephrectomy in ADPKD may be related to kidney size, the decision to proceed with native nephrectomy is often undertaken on an individual basis, without specific reference to kidney size measurements.[74]\nTwo modalities of dialysis can be used in the treatment of ADPKD patients: peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis.[78] Epidemiological data shows that ADPKD affects 5–13.4% of patients undergoing hemodialysis in Europe and in the United States,[79][80][81] and about 3% in Japan.[7] Peritoneal dialysis has usually been contra-indicated in ADPKD patients with large kidney and liver volumes, due to expected physical difficulties in the procedure and possible complications;[78][82] however, no difference is seen in long-term morbidity between hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis in ADPKD.[78]\nKidney transplantation is accepted as the preferred treatment for ADPKD patients with ESRD.[1] Among American patients on the kidney-transplant waiting list (as of December 2011), 7256 (8.4%) were listed due to cystic kidney disease and of the 16,055 renal transplants performed in 2011, 2057 (12.8%) were done for patients with cystic kidney disease, with 1,189 from deceased donors and 868 from living donors.[83]\nThere are several novel therapies currently underway aimed at slowing the progression of disease in APKD. Alternative therapeutic options include water therapy, the use of lipid-lowering agents, antiproliferative analogues, and synthetic peptides.[13]\nWater Therapy\nIncreased water intake downregulates vasopressin activity. As a result, water therapy has been explored as a potential therapeutic intervention for individuals with ADPKD; however, studies examining its role in ADPKD advancement remain unclear.[13]\nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors\nThe progression of ADPKD leads to a decline in kidney function, with a marked decrease in glomerular filtration rate. As a result, treatment with statins is recommended by current guidelines for managing chronic kidney disease. The effect of statins on slowing ADPKD is inconclusive, with some trials showing a decrease in total kidney volume, while others showed no benefit on either total kidney volume or glomerular filtration rate.[13]\nSomatostatin analogs\nSomatostatin is are artificial peptide designed to mimic the function of an endogenous hormone that has many regulatory functions within the body, including restraining cell proliferation. Small phase 2 studies have shown that somatostatin analogues are effective at reducing the rate of total kidney volume growth and preserving glomerular filtration rate.[13] The use of somatostatin analogues may be restricted due to their side effects, which commonly include gastrointestinal issues such as diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and gas, as well as conditions like gallstones and elevated blood sugar.\nAnti-proliferative agents\nProliferation of epithelial cells lining the cyst results in cyst expansion and contributes to disease progression. As a result of this mechanism, antiproliferative agents such as tyrosine kinase inhibitor bosutinib. However, results in clinical trials have shown mixed results, with studies showing a decrease in total kidney volume. [13][84]",
    "Prognosis": "In ADPKD patients, gradual cyst development and expansion result in kidney enlargement, and during the disease, glomerular filtration rate remains normal for decades before kidney function starts to progressively deteriorate, making early prediction of renal outcome difficult.[85] The CRISP study,[36][47] mentioned in the treatment section above, contributed to build a strong rationale supporting the prognostic value of total kidney volume (TKV) in ADPKD; TKV (evaluated by MRI) increases steadily and a higher rate of kidney enlargement correlated with accelerated decline of GFR, while patient height-adjusted TKV (HtTKV) ≥600 ml/m predicts the development of stage 3 chronic kidney disease within 8 years.[85]\nBesides TKV and HtTKV, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) has also been tentatively used to predict the progression of ADPKD.[85] After the analysis of CT or MRI scans of 590 patients with ADPKD treated at the Mayo Translational Polycystic Kidney Disease Center, Irazabal and colleagues developed an imaging-based classification system to predict the rate of eGFR decline in patients with ADPKD.[85][47] In this prognostic method, patients are divided into five subclasses of estimated kidney growth rates according to age-specific HtTKV ranges (1A, <1.5%; 1B, 1.5–3.0%; 1C, 3.0–4.5%; 1D, 4.5–6.0%; and 1E, >6.0%) as delineated in the CRISP study.[85][47] The decline in eGFR over the years following initial TKV measurement is significantly different between all five patient subclasses, with those in subclass 1E having the most rapid decline.[85] Some of the most common causes of death in patients with ADPKD are various infections (25%), a ruptured berry aneurysm (15%), or coronary/hypertensive heart disease (40%).[86]"

    "Disease": "Autosomal dominant porencephaly type I",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Different people are affected very differently by this disease. The main manifestation is fluid-filled cysts that grow on the brain and can cause damage that varies depending on their location and severity. Symptoms may manifest early in infancy, or may manifest as late as adulthood. Symptoms associated with autosomal dominant porencephaly type I include migraines, hemiplegia or hemiparesis, seizures, cognitive impairment, strokes, dystonia, speech disorders, involuntary muscle spasms, visual field defects, and hydrocephalus.[2]",
    "Diagnosis": "Though it is only definitively diagnosed by a genetic test, autosomal dominant porencephaly type I can be suspected if the disease is known to run in the family or if someone shows symptoms. CT scanning or MRI may be useful in indicating a diagnosis. COL4A1 may be mutated in other diseases that need to be distinguished, including brain small vessel disease with hemorrhage and HANAC syndrome. CADASIL syndrome is caused by a mutation in a different gene, but may cause similar symptoms. Sporadic porencephaly is another disorder that can appear similar.[2]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment for autosomal dominant porencephaly type I is based on the symptoms that an individual is experiencing - for example, treatment of seizures with anticonvulsants. It is particularly important for individuals with this disorder and hypertension to control their blood pressure, as they are at higher risk of stroke. Other stroke prevention treatments include avoiding anticoagulants, smoking, and situations that may lead to head trauma.[2]",

    "Disease": "Bal%C3%B3 concentric sclerosis",
    "Causes": "The pathogenesis of Baló concentric sclerosis and pattern III multiple sclerosis lesions has been a subject of ongoing debate. Early hypotheses proposed that pattern III lesions represented an initial stage in the development of classical multiple sclerosis plaques; however, subsequent pathological and immunological studies have cast doubt on this view, suggesting that these lesions may instead reflect a distinct pathogenic process.[37] Pattern III lesions are characterized by features of distal oligodendrogliopathy and selective oligodendrocyte apoptosis, which differ from the more common pattern I and pattern II multiple sclerosis lesions, where perivascular T-cell infiltration and antibody and complement deposition dominate.[35] This distinct pathology has led to consideration of alternative environmental or infectious triggers as contributing factors to the development of these lesions.[35] One such proposed trigger involves the bacterium Clostridium perfringens. A study by Rumah et al. (2013) identified type B strains of C. perfringens, known for producing the epsilon toxin, in a patient at the first clinical presentation of multiple sclerosis, suggesting a potential environmental association with lesion initiation.[13] This hypothesis is supported by findings showing that individuals with multiple sclerosis exhibit significantly higher immune reactivity against epsilon toxin compared to healthy controls, indicating prior exposure or immune sensitization to this microbial product.[13]\nFurther complicating the etiological understanding of Baló concentric sclerosis is evidence of astrocytic involvement with lesion formation. Studies have demonstrated loss of both auqaporin-1 (AQP1) and aquaporin-4 (AQP4) channels in demyelinated regions of Baló concentric sclerosis patients, even in the absence of detectable AQP4 autoantibodies.[38] This pattern of astrocyte damage differs from that seen in classical neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), where AQP4-IgG antibodies are typically present, yet suggests a possible overlap in the astrocytopathic mechanisms contributing to lesion development. Patients have also shown heightened immune reactivity to AQP1 peptides, implying that astrocytic injury may be mediated by mechanisms other than antibody binding, possibly involving direct T-cell cytotoxicity or toxin-mediated astrocytic dysfunction.[38]",
    "Diagnosis": "Baló's concentric sclerosis is primarily diagnosed through characteristic findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), supported by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and, in some cases, histopathological evaluation.[24] The hallmark radiological feature is the appearance of concentric layers of demyelinated and preserved white matter, producing alternating hyperintense and hypointense bands on T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences.[25] These lesions are typically large and tumefactive, often located in the cerebral hemispheric white matter, particularly the frontal and parietal lobes, but can also involve the corpus callosum, brainstem, or spinal cord.[25][22]\nUse of high-field 7-Tesla MRI has further refined lesion visualization, often revealing a central vein within Baló lesions, which supports the view of a perivenular pathogenesis similar to classical MS.[24] Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) has demonstrated increased lactate and decreased N-acetylaspartate within Baló lesions, indicating active inflammation and neuronal loss, while diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) shows decreased fractional anisotropy, reflecting white matter damage.[25] These imaging markers are highly consistent with histopathological features, enabling radiological-histopathological correlation and reducing the need for invasive biopsy in most cases.[25]\nCSF analysis in Baló's concentric sclerosis typically shows either normal findings or mild mononuclear pleocytosis, but differs from classical multiple sclerosis in that CSF-restricted oligoclonal bands are present only in a minority of cases.[13] Pattern III lesions, including Baló's concentric sclerosis, also tend to test negative for the MRZ reaction, which detects intrathecal responses to measles, rubella, and varicella zoster virus, further distinguishing them from standard multiple sclerosis.[13]\nIn pediatric populations, Baló's concentric sclerosis has been observed to have a more variable clinical course, with some children exhibiting favorable outcomes and lesion resolution on imaging, while other experience severe presentations similar to adult forms.[26] Baló lesions have been identified in children presenting with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)-like features, reflecting the overlap of concentric lesion morphology across multiple demyelinating syndromes.[26]",
    "Treatment": "Acute Management\nHigh dose intravenous corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, are commonly administered as first-line therapy for acute Baló's concentric sclerosis episodes to reduce inflammation and stabilize the blood-brain barrier.[27][28] However, responses to corticosteroids can be variable, with some patients exhibiting limited improvement.[27]\nImmunosuppressive and Disease-Modifying Therapies\nGiven the overlap of Baló's concentric sclerosis with other demyelinating disorders, various immunosuppressive agents have been explored:\nCyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent that suppresses the immune system, and has been used in aggressive or refractory cases of Baló's concentric sclerosis, sometimes in combination with other therapies.[27] Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody targeting CD20-positive B cells (B cell markers) and has shown to benefit patients with features suggestive of antibody-mediated pathology.[29][10] Another monoclonal antibody called Alemtuzumab targets CD52 and depletes a broad range of immune cells. The use of Alemtuzumab in Baló's concentric sclerosis has been reported in a case study indicating potential benefits, although some outcomes can vary.[18] Ocrelizumab is similar to Rituximad in that it targets CD20-positive B cells and has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing lesion size and improving neurological function in cases of Baló's concentric sclerosis.[28]\nSupportive Care and Monitoring\nRegular monitoring through MRI is essential to assess lesion progression or resolution. Given the potential for spontaneous remission in some cases, treatment plans should be individualized, balancing the risks and benefits of aggressive immunosuppression.[3] Multidisciplinary care, including physical and occupational therapy, may aid in functional recovery and improve quality of life.[27]",
    "Epidemiology": "Baló's concentric sclerosis most commonly affects individuals between 20–40 years of age, although pediatric and elderly cases have been documented.[13] While multiple sclerosis is generally more prevalent in females, Baló's concentric sclerosis seems to show a slight male predominance, distinguishing from typical multiple sclerosis epidemiological patterns.[13] In addition to its occurrence as an isolated demyelinating syndrome, Baló's lesions have also been reported in association with tumefactive inflammatory leukoencephalopathy,[30] where they may present as part of a larger tumefactive plaques.\nPotential associations between Baló's concentric sclerosis and systemic autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis and autoimmune thyroiditis, have also been reported, although the significance of these findings remain unclear and warrants further investigation.[31]\nPattern III (Baló-like) Demyelinating Spectrum\nBaló-like lesions were classified as MS lesion pattern III in the MS spectrum. They have been reported alone, but also associated to standard multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, CADASIL and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.[32] There is an overlap between what is considered Baló concentric sclerosis and some atypical cases of multiple sclerosis. A special subtype of multiple sclerosis presents Baló-like lesions (pattern III lesions) creating an intersection between these two conditions.[33]\nSome patients with Baló concentric sclerosis present oligoclonal bands while others do not. It has been proposed that Baló concentric sclerosis lesions may not denote a single disease, but a final pathway of various demyelinating diseases, reflecting the presence of intralesional hypoxia as recently proposed.[13] Recently it has been reported that pattern III lesions are responsive to mitoxantrone.[34] On the other hand, this pattern is the less responsive to plasmapheresis.[35] Pattern III lesions can be diagnosed without a biopsy because these patients show a high reactivity to AQP1 (without antibody) and varicella zoster virus (VZV).[36]\nThe pathogenesis of Baló concentric sclerosis and pattern III multiple sclerosis lesions has been a subject of ongoing debate.

    "Disease": "Becker muscular dystrophy",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Some symptoms consistent with Becker muscular dystrophy are:\nIndividuals with this disorder typically experience progressive muscle weakness of the leg and pelvis muscles, which is associated with a loss of muscle mass (wasting). Muscle weakness also occurs in the arms, neck, and other areas, but is not as noticeably severe as in the lower half of the body. Calf muscles initially enlarge during the ages of 5–15 (an attempt by the body to compensate for the loss of muscle strength), but the enlarged muscle tissue is eventually replaced by fat and connective tissue (pseudohypertrophy) as the legs become less used (with use of a wheelchair).[medical citation needed]\nPossible complications associated with muscular dystrophies (MD) are cardiac arrhythmias.[11] Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) also demonstrates the following:",
    "Diagnosis": "In terms of the diagnosis of Becker muscular dystrophy symptom development resembles that of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. A physical exam indicates a lack of pectoral and upper arm muscles, especially when the disease is unnoticed through the early teen years. Muscle wasting begins in the legs and pelvis, and then progresses to the muscles of the shoulders and neck. Calf muscle enlargement (pseudohypertrophy) is quite obvious. Among the exams/tests performed are:[19][20]",
    "Treatment": "There is no known cure for Becker muscular dystrophy yet. Treatment is aimed at control of symptoms to maximize the quality of life which can be measured by specific questionnaires.[21] Activity is encouraged and can be considered vital for long-term survivability for these patients.[22] Inactivity (such as bed rest) or sitting down for too long can worsen the muscle disease. Physical therapy may be helpful to maintain muscle strength. Orthopedic appliances such as braces and wheelchairs may improve mobility and self-care.[14]\nImmunosuppressant steroids have been known to help slow the progression of Becker muscular dystrophy.[23] The drug prednisone contributes to increased production of the protein utrophin which closely resembles dystrophin, the protein that is defective in BMD.[24]\nThe cardiac problems that occur with EDMD and myotonic muscular dystrophy may require a pacemaker.[25] Other cardiomyopathies seen in Becker muscular dystrophy can also be treated with ACE inhibitors, cardiac transplant, and other personalized treatments.[22]\nThe investigational drug Debio-025 is a known inhibitor of the protein cyclophilin D, which regulates the swelling of mitochondria in response to cellular injury. Researchers decided to test the drug in mice engineered to carry MD after earlier laboratory tests showed deleting a gene that encodes cyclophilin D reduced swelling and reversed or prevented the disease's muscle-damaging characteristics.[26] According to a review by Bushby, et al. if a primary protein is not functioning properly then maybe another protein could take its place by augmenting it. Upregulation of compensatory proteins has been done in models of transgenic mice.[27]",
    "Prognosis": "The progression of Becker muscular dystrophy is highly variable—much more so than Duchenne muscular dystrophy. There is also a form that may be considered as an intermediate between Duchenne and Becker MD (mild DMD or severe BMD).\nThe severity of the disease may be indicated by the age of the patient at the onset of the disease. One study showed that there may be two distinct patterns of progression in Becker muscular dystrophy. Onset at around age 7 to 8 years of age shows more cardiac involvement and trouble climbing stairs by age 20, if onset is around age 12, there is less cardiac involvement.[19][28]\nThe quality of life for patients with Becker muscular dystrophy can be impacted by the symptoms of the disorder. However, with assistive devices, independence can be maintained. People affected by Becker muscular dystrophy can still maintain active lifestyles.[29]"

    "Signs and symptoms": "Nearly all people with Behçet's disease present with some form of painful ulcerations inside the mouth.[4] They are a form of aphthous ulcers or non-scarring oral lesions.[4] The oral lesions are similar to those found in inflammatory bowel disease and can be relapsing.[4] Painful genital ulcerations usually develop around the anus, vulva, or scrotum and cause scarring in 75 percent of the patients.[4] Additionally, patients may present with erythema nodosum, cutaneous pustular vasculitis, and lesions similar to pyoderma gangrenosum.[4]\nInflammatory eye disease can develop early in the disease course and lead to permanent vision loss in 20 percent of cases. Ocular involvement can be in the form of posterior uveitis, anterior uveitis, or retinal vasculitis. Anterior uveitis presents with painful eyes, conjuctival redness, hypopyon, and decreased visual acuity, while posterior uveitis presents with painless decreased visual acuity and visual field floaters. A rare form of ocular (eye) involvement in this syndrome is retinal vasculitis which presents with painless decrease of vision with the possibility of floaters or visual field defects.[4]\nOptic nerve involvement in Behçet's disease is rare, typically presenting as progressive optic atrophy and visual loss. However, cases of acute optic neuropathy (specifically anterior ischemic optic neuropathy) have also been reported to occur.[5] Optic nerve atrophy has been identified as the most common cause of visual impairment. Behçet's disease may result in primary or secondary optic nerve involvement. Papilledema as a result of dural sinus thrombosis[6] and atrophy resulting from retinal disease, have been characterized as secondary causes of optic nerve atrophy in Behçet's disease.[7][8]\nSigns and symptoms of acute optic neuropathy include painless loss of vision which may affect either one or both eyes, reduced visual acuity, reduced color vision, relative afferent pupillary defect, central scotoma, swollen optic disc, macular edema, or retrobulbar pain. When these symptoms occur with concurrent mucocutaneous ulcerations, they raise suspicion of acute optic neuropathy in Behçet's Disease. Progressive optic atrophy may result in decreased visual acuity or color vision. Intracranial hypertension with papilledema may be present.[9]\nEpiscleritis may occur, which causes eye redness and mild pain, without a significant impact on vision.[10]\nGastrointestinal (GI) manifestations include abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea with or without blood, and they often involve the terminal ileum and ileocecal valve.[4] Some patients with BD experience abdominal tenderness, bloating, and general abdominal discomfort. When mild this can resemble irritable bowel syndrome; more severe cases bear similarities to inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's. Behçet's disease causes ulcers in the terminal ileum and ileocecal valve. The ulcers may be aphthous or have a classic punched out appearance with undermining. Linear and fissuring ulcers up to 5 cm may be present. Biopsies show vasculitis (phlebitis or venulitis) with a neutrophilic inflammatory infiltrate. Involvement of the oesophagus, stomach and large intestine is rare.[citation needed]\nLung involvement is typically in the form of hemoptysis, pleuritis, cough, or fever, and in severe cases can be life-threatening if the outlet pulmonary artery develops an aneurysm which ruptures causing severe vascular collapse and death from bleeding in the lungs.[4] Pulmonary artery thrombosis may occur.\nArthritis is seen in up to half of people, and is usually a non-erosive poly or oligoarthritis primarily of the large joints of the lower extremities.[4]\nBehçet's disease can rarely result in renal involvement. This can manifest in the following:\nSmall vessel vascular disease results in renal vasculitis, whereas large vessel involvement causes aneurysms (bulging) and thrombosis (blockages). Serious kidney problems are more common in men typically with a history of large vessel involvement in other parts of the body. Bladder and urethral involvement is rare in Behçet's disease.\nCentral nervous system (CNS) involvement most often occurs as a chronic meningoencephalitis. Lesions tend to occur in the brainstem, the basal ganglia and deep hemispheric white matter and may resemble those of multiple sclerosis (MS). Brainstem atrophy is seen in chronic cases.[citation needed]\nNeurological involvements range from aseptic meningitis to vascular thrombosis such as dural sinus thrombosis and organic brain syndrome manifesting with confusion, seizures, and memory loss. Sudden hearing loss (sensorineural) is often associated with it.[4] They often appear late in the progression of the disease but are associated with a poor prognosis.[citation needed]\nChronic aortic regurgitation due to aortic root disease may also be seen.[11] Although infrequent, myocardial infarction (heart attack) with angiographically identified acute coronary artery thrombosis has been reported, including one case with a pathologically demonstrable lesion due to arteritis found at autopsy.[12]\nBlood vessel problems are observed in 7–29% of people with arterial lesions representing 15% of vascular lesions. Arterial lesions pose a greater risk. Most common arterial lesions are occlusions or stenosis and aneurysms or pseudoaneurysms.[13] [citation needed]",
    "Causes": "The cause is not well-defined, but it is primarily characterized by auto-inflammation of the blood vessels. Although sometimes erroneously referred to as a diagnosis of exclusion, the diagnosis can sometimes be reached by pathologic examination of the affected areas.[14]\nThe primary mechanism of the damage is autoimmune, which by definition is an overactive immune system that targets the patient's own body. The involvement of a subset of T cells (Th17) seems to be important.[15] The primary cause is not well known. In fact, no one knows yet why the immune system starts to behave this way in Behçet's disease. There does however seem to be a genetic component involved, as first degree relatives of the affected patients are often affected in more than the expected proportion for the general population.[citation needed]\nResearch suggests that previous infections may provoke the autoimmune responses present in Behçet's disease. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are present in some bacteria and serve as a \"danger signal\" to the immune system. However, some HSPs share a similarity in bacteria and humans.[16] The anti-HSP60 and anti-HSP65 antibodies that target HSPs produced by Streptococci (including S. sanguinis and S. pyogenes) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis can also target human HSPs, leading to immune responses linked to uveitis and various symptoms shown in parenchymal neuro-Behçet's disease.[17]\nAn association with the GIMAP (\"GTPase of the immunity-associated protein\") family of genes on the long arm of chromosome 7 (7q36.1) has been reported.[18] Gene locations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with Behçet's disease included GIMAP1, GIMAP2 and GIMAP4.[18]",
    "Diagnosis": "There is no specific pathological testing or technique available for the diagnosis of the disease, although the International Study Group criteria for the disease are highly sensitive and specific, involving clinical criteria and a pathergy test.[4][24] Behçet's disease has a high degree of resemblance to diseases that cause mucocutaneous lesions such as Herpes simplex labialis, and therefore clinical suspicion should be maintained until all the common causes of oral lesions are ruled out from the differential diagnosis.[citation needed]\nVisual acuity, or color vision loss with concurrent mucocutaneous lesions or systemic Behçet's disease symptoms should raise suspicion of optic nerve involvement in Behçet's disease and prompt a work-up for Behçet's disease if not previously diagnosed in addition to an ocular work-up. Diagnosis of Behçet's disease is based on clinical findings including oral and genital ulcers, skin lesions such as erythema nodosum, acne, or folliculitis, ocular inflammatory findings and a pathergy reaction. Inflammatory markers such ESR, and CRP may be elevated. A complete ophthalmic examination may include a slit lamp examination, optical coherence tomography to detect nerve loss, visual field examinations, fundoscopic examination to assess optic disc atrophy and retinal disease, fundoscopic angiography, and visual evoked potentials, which may demonstrate increased latency. Optic nerve enhancement may be identified on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in some patients with acute optic neuropathy. However, a normal study does not rule out optic neuropathy. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis may demonstrate elevated protein level with or without pleocytosis. Imaging including angiography may be indicated to identify dural venous sinus thrombosis as a cause of intracranial hypertension and optic atrophy.[citation needed]\nAccording to the International Study Group guidelines, for a patient to be diagnosed with Behçet's disease,[24] the patient must have oral (aphthous) ulcers (any shape, size, or number at least three times in any twelve-month period) along with two of the following four hallmark symptoms.\nDespite the inclusive criteria set forth by the International Study Group, there are cases where not all the criteria can be met and therefore a diagnosis cannot readily be made. There is, however, a set of clinical findings that a physician can rely upon in making a tentative diagnosis of the disease; essentially, Behçet's disease does not always follow the International Study Group guidelines and so a high degree of suspicion for a patient who presents having any number of the following findings is necessary:[25]",
    "Treatment": "Current treatment is aimed at easing the symptoms, reducing inflammation, and controlling the immune system. The quality of the evidence for treating the oral ulcers associated with Behçet's disease, however, is poor.[26]\nHigh-dose corticosteroid therapy is often used for severe disease manifestations.[27] Anti-TNF therapy such as infliximab has shown promise in treating the uveitis associated with the disease.[28][29] Infliximab as well as other anti-TNF therapies including etanercept and adalimumab may be useful in treating mucocutaneous disease according to several case reports and prospective studies, as well as one randomized trial for etanercept.[30][31][32] Apremilast may also be used to treat oral ulcers associated with Behçet's disease.[33]\nInterferon alpha-2a may also be an effective alternative treatment, particularly for the genital and oral ulcers[34] as well as ocular lesions.[35] Azathioprine, when used in combination with interferon alpha-2b also shows promise,[36] and colchicine can be useful for treating some genital ulcers, erythema nodosum, and arthritis.[37] Benzathine-penicillin may also reduce new arthritic attacks.[38]\nThalidomide has also been used due to its immune-modifying effect.[39] Dapsone and rebamipide have been shown, in small studies, to have beneficial results for mucocutaneous lesions.[40][41]\nGiven its rarity, the optimal treatment for acute optic neuropathy in Behçet's disease has not been established. Early identification and treatment are essential. Response to ciclosporin, periocular triamcinolone, and IV methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisone has been reported although relapses leading to irreversible visual loss may occur even with treatment.[42] Immunosuppressants such as interferon-alpha and tumour necrosis factor antagonists may improve though not completely reverse symptoms of ocular Behçet's disease, which may progress over time despite treatment. When symptoms are limited to the anterior chamber of the eye prognosis is improved. Posterior involvement, particularly optic nerve involvement, is a poor prognostic indicator. Secondary optic nerve atrophy is frequently irreversible. Lumbar puncture or surgical treatment may be required to prevent optic atrophy in cases of intracranial hypertension refractory to treatment with immunomodulators and steroids.[citation needed]\nIntravenous immunoglobulin therapy (IVIg) could be a treatment for severe[43] or complicated cases.[44][45]\nA recent 2024 reports that infliximab improved the likelihood of achieving a complete response at 22 weeks for patients with severe Behçet's syndrome compared to cyclophosphamide, according to head-to-head trial data.[46] Mild to moderate adverse events, primarily infections, were reported in 29.6% of patients on infliximab and 64% on cyclophosphamide. Serious adverse events occurred in 15% and 12% of patients, respectively.[47]\nSurgical treatment of arterial manifestations of BD bears many pitfalls since the obliterative endarteritis of vasa vasorum causes thickening of the medial layer and splitting of elastin fibers. Therefore, anastomotic pseudoaneurysms are likely to form, as well as pseudoaneurysms at the site of the puncture in case of angiography or endovascular treatment; furthermore, early graft occlusion may occur.[citation needed]\nFor these reasons, invasive treatment should not be performed in the acute and active phases of the disease when inflammation is at its peak. The evaluation of disease's activity is usually based on relapsing symptoms, ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), and serum levels of CRP (C-reactive protein).[citation needed]\nEndovascular treatment can be an effective and safe alternative to open surgery, with less postoperative complications, faster recovery time, and reduced need for intensive care, while offering patency rates and procedural success rates comparable with those of surgery. This notwithstanding, long-term results of endovascular treatment in BD are still to be determined.[citation needed]",
    "Epidemiology": "The syndrome is rare in the United States, Africa and South America, but is common in Asia, suggesting a possible cause endemic to those areas.[48] A theory suggested that past exposure to lethal infectious agents might have fixed the genetic susceptibility factors to Behçet's disease in those area.[49] An estimated 15,000 to 20,000 Americans have been diagnosed with this disease. In the UK, it is estimated to have about 1 case for every 100,000 people.[50]\nIn an epidemiologic study, 56 percent of patients with Behçet's disease developed ocular involvement at a mean age of 30.[51] Ocular involvement was the first manifestation of Behçet's disease in 8.6 percent of patients.[51] Ocular Behçet's disease with involvement of the optic nerve is rarely reported. Among patients with ocular Behçet's disease funduscopic findings of optic atrophy, and optic disc paleness have been identified with a frequency of 17.9 percent and 7.4 percent, respectively. Other fundoscopic findings include vascular sheathing (23.7%),[7] retinal hemorrhage (9%),[7] macular edema (11.3%),[7] branch retinal vein occlusion (5.8%),[7] and retinal edema (6.6%).[7] However, optic atrophy was the most significant cause of visual impairment identified in 54 percent of patients with ocular Behçet's disease and permanent visual impairment.[7]"

    "Disease": "Benign hereditary chorea",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Benign Hereditary Chorea is characterized by early onset of an abnormal gait, speech articulation difficulties, anxiety, and chorea.[5]\nThe clinical spectrum of symptoms resulting from BHC is vast, manifesting as thyroid agenesis to dysarthria to distress syndrome. As a result, genetic testing is the only way to confirm the syndrome.[2]\nBHC is caused by a single-nucleotide substitution mutation in TITF1, which encodes thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. This gene is also known as NK2 homeobox 1 (NKX2-1)[2] The single-nucleotide substitution mutation then ultimately has drastic effects on the maturation processes of TITF-1[4]\nIn some cases, additional developmental abnormalities of lung and thyroid tissue are found in BHC, leading to the suggested alternative name brain-lung-thyroid syndrome.[6]",
    "Diagnosis": "BHC begins showing symptoms during childhood, and is commonly a familial disorder. This is a disorder that is correlated with mutations in the thyroid transcription factor gene (TITF-1).[7]\nThe disorder was discovered in 1960s. During the time of its discovery, there were no tests that could be used to confirm a diagnosis of the disorder, and the phenotype was not easy to distinguish from other disorders. This resulted in the existence of the disorder being questioned. However, in 2002, the experimentally observed mutation of the gene leading to the BHC phenotype was identified, solidifying benign hereditary chorea as a disorder.[7]\nIn 1967, several families were examined and discovered to have movements that were abnormal and random since childhood. These random movements were not violent movements, and gave the person a \"general appearance of restlessness.\" The movements occurred mostly in the hands and arms, and some also experienced them in their tongues, facial muscles, and lower body. Movements in the lower extremities, if severe enough, could cause changes in gait. The families were given a Wechsler Intelligence Scale test, scoring average relative to others in their community. Aside from the aforementioned symptoms, the peoples' physical and neurological characteristics were normal. The observed symptoms were put in the category of chorea.[7]\nResearchers made pedigrees of the families they studied and determined that BHC was an autosomal dominant disorder. By studying a Dutch family, the disorder was discovered to be linked to chromosome 14. In 2002, an Italian family was studied, and they had the same linkage to chromosome 14 as the Dutch family did. Looking closer at the region of the chromosome suspected of causing the disorder, researchers discovered that there was a 1.2 Mb deletion in the DNA that resulted in the loss of the TITF-1 gene. This meant that mutations in the TITF-1 gene were likely the reason behind the symptoms of BHC.[7]\nCurrently, BHC is diagnosed through the identification of the phenotypic symptoms with a genetic test to confirm the mutation in the TITF-1 gene.[7]",
    "Treatment": "There are no cures for benign hereditary chorea, but there are several medications that have been shown to treat the symptoms of the disorder. Levodopa has been shown to improve the effects of chorea on a patient's gait within 6 weeks of starting treatments. However, this medication did have the side effect of \"dose-dependent dyskinesia.\" Methylphenidate has also been used to improve chorea symptoms. Steroids have been used to treat BHC, but due to the presence of dystonia, it is questionable whether these patients actually had BHC.[7]",
    "Epidemiology": "In 1978, BHC was reported to have a frequency of 1:500,000 within a Welsh population, but due to how some symptoms are hard to distinguish, it was concluded that the number is underrespresentative of actual clinical cases. Results for correlation between sex and distribution of the disorder are inconclusive.[8]"

    "Disease": "Beta-mannosidosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The initial affected individual described in 1986 had a complex phenotype, and was later found to have both beta-mannosidosis and Sanfilippo syndrome.[5]  People have been described with a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, from infants and children with intellectual disability to adults who present with isolated skin findings (angiokeratomas).[5]\nMost cases are identified in the first year of life with respiratory infections, hearing loss and intellectual disability. Because of its rarity, and non-specific clinical findings, beta-mannosidosis can go undiagnosed until adulthood, where it can present with intellectual disability and behavioral problems, including aggression.[6][1]",
    "Causes": "In terms of causation, several mutations in the MANBA gene are the cause of beta-mannosidosis. The cytogenetic location of the gene is 4q24; furthermore, the condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.[7][2]",
    "Diagnosis": "A diagnosis of beta-mannosidosis is suspected based on the person's clinical presentation.  Urine testing to identify abnormal oligosaccharides is a useful screening test, and enzymatic analysis or molecular testing can be used for confirmation.[3]\nDiagnostic techniques for this condition can be done to offer a differential diagnosis, via lectin histochemistry, to distinguish between alpha-mannosidosis and beta-mannosidosis.[9]",
    "Treatment": "There is currently no treatment available; individuals exhibiting muscle weakness or seizures are treated based on symptoms.[4]"

  {
    "Disease": "Beta thalassemia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Symptoms depend on the type and severity of thalassemia. Carriers of thalassemia genes may have no symptoms (thalassemia minor) or very mild symptoms with occasional crisis (thalassemia intermedia); individuals who are homozygous for the mutation have severe and life threatening symptoms (thalassemia major).[21][22]\nIndividuals with beta-thalassemia major usually present within the first two years of life with symptomatic severe anemia, poor growth, and skeletal abnormalities. Untreated thalassemia major eventually leads to death, usually by heart failure.[23]\nThose with beta-thalassemia intermedia (those who are compound heterozygotes for the beta thalassemia mutation) usually present later in life with mild to moderate symptoms of anemia.[22]\nBeta thalassemia trait (beta thalassemia minor) involves heterozygous inheritance of a beta-thalassemia mutation. Individuals usually have microcytosis with mild anemia; they are usually asymptomatic or have mild symptoms.[22] Beta thalassemia minor can also present as beta-thalassemia silent carriers; those who inherit a beta thalassemic mutation but have no hematologic abnormalities or symptoms.[22]\nIndividuals with thalassemia thalassemia major and intermedia (to a lesser extent) are susceptible to health complications that involve the spleen (hypersplenism) and gallstones (due to hyperbilirubinemia from peripheral hemolysis).[22][3] Additional symptoms of beta-thalassemia major or intermedia include the classic symptoms of anemia including fatigue, developmental delay in childhood, leg ulcers, and organ failure.[22] Ineffective erythropoiesis (red blood cell production) can lead to expansion of the bone marrow in compensation; this can then lead to deformity, bone pain, and craniofacial abnormalities.[22] Organs such as the liver and spleen that can also become enrolled in red blood cell production, leading to hepatosplenomegaly (enlargement of the liver and spleen).[22]\nPeople with thalassemia can get too much iron in their bodies, either from the disease itself as RBCs are destroyed, or as a consequence of frequent blood transfusions. Excess iron is not excreted, but forms toxic  non-transferrin-bound iron.[21][24] This can lead to organ damage, potentially affecting the heart, liver, endocrine system, bones and spleen. Symptoms include an irregular heartbeat, cardiomyopathy, cirrhosis of the liver, hypothyroidism, delayed puberty and fertility problems, brittle and deformed bones, and an enlarged spleen.[25][26]\nFor clinical purposes, thalassemia is categorised as either transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) or non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia (NTDT) are used.  Patients are usually considered as having NTDT if they have received fewer than 6 red blood cell units in the past 6 months and none in the preceding 2 months.[27]",
    "Causes": "β-globin chains are encoded by the HBB gene on chromosome 11;[32] in a healthy person with two copies on each chromosome, two loci encode the β chain.[33] In beta thalassemia, a single faulty gene can be either asymptomatic or cause mild disease; if both genes are faulty this causes moderate to severe disease.[34]\nMore than 350 mutations have been identified which can cause beta thalassemia; 20 of these account for 80% of beta-thalassemia cases.[20]\nTwo major groups of mutations can be distinguished:\nMutations are characterized as (βo) if they prevent any formation of β globin chains, and mutations are characterized as (β+) if they allow some β globin chain formation to occur.[22]\nDue to globin defects, beta thalassemia patients do not have normal levels of adult hemoglobin (HbA), and instead have elevated levels of HbA2 (α2δ2).[10] Production of this form of hemoglobin may increase as a consequence of stress erythropoiesis.[40][10]",
    "Treatment": "Main article: Management of thalassemia\nTreatment for thalassemia depends on the severity of the disease. People with thalassemia traits (thalassemia minor or non transfusion dependent thalassemia), may not require medical or follow-up care after the initial diagnosis is made.[58] Occasionally transfusions may be necessary particularly around childbirth, surgery, or if other conditions provoke anemia. A folic acid supplement may also be recommended.[44]\nFor those with severe forms of thalassemia (thalassemia major, or transfusion-dependent thalassemia), the three principal treatments are red blood cell transfusions to relieve anemia, iron chelation to mitigate the side effects of transfusion, and folic acid supplementation to encourage the growth of new blood cells.[59] Other forms of treatment available depending on individual circumstances.\nBlood transfusions are the main treatment approach for prolonging life. Donated healthy red blood cells have a functional life of 4 to 6 weeks before they wear out and are broken down in the spleen. Regular transfusions every three to four weeks are necessary in order to maintain hemoglobin at a healthy level. Transfusions come with risks including iron overload, the risk of acquiring infections, and the risk of immune reaction to the donated cells (alloimmunization).[60][61]\nMultiple blood transfusions lead to severe iron overload, as the body eventually breaks down the hemoglobin in donated cells. This releases iron which it is unable to excrete. Iron overload  may be treated by chelation therapy with the medications deferoxamine, deferiprone, or deferasirox.[62] Deferoxamine is only effective as a daily injection, complicating its long-term use. Adverse effects include primary skin reactions around the injection site and hearing loss. Deferasirox and deferiprone are both oral medications, whose common side effects include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.[63]\nFolate is a B group vitamin which is involved in the manufacture of red blood cells. Folate supplementation, in the form of folic acid, is often recommended in thalassemia.[60]\nLuspatercept is a drug used to treat anemia in adults with β-thalassemia, it can improve the maturation of red blood cells and reduce the need for frequent blood transfusions. It is administered by injection every three weeks. Luspatercept was authorised for use in the US in 2019 and by the European Medicines Agency in 2020.[64]\nHydroxyurea is another drug that can sometimes be administered to relieve anemia caused by beta-thalassemia. This is achieved, in part, by reactivating fetal haemoglobin production; however its effectiveness is uncertain.[65][66][67]\nPeople with thalassemia are at a higher risk of osteoporosis. Treatment options include bisphosphonates and zinc supplementation.[68]\nThe spleen is the organ which removes damaged or misshapen red blood cells from the circulation. In thalassemia, this can lead to the spleen becoming enlarged, a condition known as splenomegaly. Slight enlargement of the spleen is not a problem, however if it becomes extreme then surgical removal of the spleen (splenectomy) may be recommended.[21]",
    "Epidemiology": "Beta thalassemia is particularly prevalent among the Mediterranean peoples and this geographical association is responsible for its naming: thalassa (θάλασσα) is the Greek word for sea and haima (αἷμα) is the Greek word for blood.[95][96] In Europe, the highest prevalence of beta-thalassemia trait is found in Greece, Turkey, and Mediterranean islands such as Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Cyprus, Malta and Crete.[97][98]\nBeta thalassemia is most prevalent in the \"thalassemia belt\" which includes areas in Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Mediterranean extending into the Middle East and Southeast Asia.[22] This geographical distribution is thought to be due to the beta-thalassemia carrier state (beta-thalassemia minor) conferring resistance to malaria.[22] In 2005, it was estimated that 1.5% of the world's population are carriers and 60,000 affected infants are born with the thalassemia major annually.[20]\nThe thalassemia trait may confer a degree of protection against malaria, which is historically endemic in the regions where the trait is common.[99] This is thought to confer a selective survival advantage on carriers (known as heterozygous advantage), thus perpetuating the mutation. In that respect, the various thalassemias resemble other genetic disorders affecting hemoglobin, such as sickle-cell disease or Hemoglobin C disease.[100]"

    "Disease": "Bethlem myopathy",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Bethlem myopathy is a slowly progressive muscle disease characterized predominantly by contractures, rigidity of the spine, skin abnormalities and proximal muscle weakness.[5][11] Symptoms may present as early as infancy, with typical contractures and hyperlaxity of joints; however, in some patients, symptoms may go unnoticed until adolescence or adulthood.[11] Serum creatine kinase (CK) is usually normal to mildly elevated (<5×).[11]\nEarly on, there may be distal laxity (hypermobility), but all of those with Bethlem myopathy eventually develop multiple joint contractures: long finger flexors, wrists, elbows, hips, knees and ankles.[5][11] There may also be club foot, scoliosis or rigid spine.[5][11] Skin abnormalities are common, including keloid formation, ‘cigarette paper scarring’ (atrophic scarring), velvety soft skin, and follicular hyperkeratosis.[11][6]\n'Bethlem sign' is the typical sign in Bethlem myopathy patients demonstrating long finger flexor contractures. With palms facing each other and with elbows raised, patients try, but fail, to make full contact of one hand against the other (in what looks like the gesture of hands during prayer).[12]\n(Collagen VI genes)\nSee Bethlem myopathy 1 Clinical synopsis on OMIM: 158810\nIn Bethlem myopathy 1, in the calf, one of the first signs is often a 'rim' of fatty infiltration between the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles.[12][13][14] Although there is fatty infiltration, the calf muscles do not appear pseudohypertrophic, in fact they may appear  slender.[15][12][16][17][18] In the thighs, there is also significant fatty infiltration of the vasti muscles, with a rim of fatty infiltration on the periphery of the muscles, while the center is more or less spared (characteristic \"outside-in\" pattern).[12][19] This \"outside-in\" pattern distinguishes it from other myopathies known to have contractures, such as Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy.[12]\nThe exception is the rectus femoris muscle of the thigh, where fatty infiltration occurs in the center of the muscle, but spares the periphery. This unusual pattern is described as a \"central cloud\" and is also a distinguishing feature, as it is not seen in the rectus femoris of LMNA-related Emery-Dreifuss myopathy.[12]\nBethlem myopathy 1 may also include neonatal-onset torticollis (neck contracture) and hypotonia (\"floppy baby\"), delayed motor mile stones, with respiratory difficulties potentially occurring later in life.[20][12] Contractures presenting in infancy may resolve by age 2 years, but reoccur as the disease progresses, typically by late of the first decade or early teens.[12]\n(Collagen XII gene)\nSee Bethlem myopathy 2 Clinical synopsis on OMIM: 616471\nIn Bethlem myopathy 2, there is phenotypic variability. In one family, the only notable finding on T1-weighted MR images (used to detect fatty infiltration) was atrophy of the rectus femoris muscles of the thigh, with the degree of atrophy matching the severity of the disease, but no fatty infiltration.[14][11] In another family, only the more severely affected older patient showed significant abnormality, by having symmetrical fatty atrophy of the femoral quadriceps of the thigh, the adductor and medial gastrocnemius muscles of the calf; as well as asymmetrical fatty atrophy of the adductor longus of the thigh.[11] No muscle hypertrophy was reported and the muscles of the patients without fatty atrophy appeared normal.[11]\nBethlem myopathy 2 also differs by including the possibility of scapula winging, pectus excavatum, stooped posture, kyphosis (hunchback), micrognathia, retrognathia, and a high-arched palate.[14] Childhood muscle weakness improves in teen years, but muscle weakness returns by the third decade of life.[11]",
    "Diagnosis": "The disease may be diagnosed based on a clinical examination, which identifies signs and symptoms generally associated with the people who have the condition. Genetic testing for known pathological variants is preferred, by testing of the COL6A1, COL6A2, COL6A3 and COL12A1 genes.[7][3] In the case of a VUS, testing of dermal fibroblast culture is used for an accurate diagnosis.[6]\nAdditional laboratory tests may be performed before genetic testing, such as creatine kinase (CK) blood test, MRI of the muscles, and electromyography (EMG).\nPhenotypes of overlap between Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD) and Bethlem can be assumed. In the differential diagnosis of UCMD, even in patients without finger contractures, Bethlem myopathy could be considered.[21]\nUllrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD) involves mutations on the same genes as Bethlem myopathy, but has a more severe presentation, with the ability to walk (ambulation) typically being lost between the ages of 5–15 years.[12] Autosomal recessive myosclerosis myopathy is allelic to the COL6A2 gene, it includes multiple contractures of the joints with slender muscles which are infiltrated by connective tissue and fibrosis, giving them a firm, \"woody\" feel upon palpitation.[22][23]\nThe symptoms of Bethlem myopathy may overlap with other conditions including Emery–Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, congenital muscular dystrophies, limb girdle muscular dystrophies, FHL1-related myopathies (X-linked myopathy with postural muscle atrophy, reducing body myopathy, and scapuloperoneal myopathy), and some forms of Ehlers–Danlos syndrome.[11] Tubular aggregate myopathy (TAM1 & TAM2) includes, among other symptoms, contractures, muscle weakness, and fatty atrophy of muscle.[24][25][26]\nTypical to Bethlem myopathy 1 and 2 are the presence of multiple contractures.[11][5] A contracture can be caused by a variety of reasons, from disease to lifestyle (see Muscle contractures). If the patient lacks multiple contractures, as well as lacks other common symptoms of Bethlem myopathy, and in addition has muscular symptoms which are not known to be associated with Bethlem myopathy such as muscle hypertrophy, exercise-induced (dynamic) symptoms rather than fixed muscle weakness (static) symptoms, or cardiac involvement such as arrhythmia, then other myopathies should be considered.",
    "Treatment": "Currently there is no cure for the disease. Symptomatic treatment, which aims to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life is the main treatment method of Bethlem myopathy. It is believed that physical therapy, stretching exercises, orthoses such as braces and splints, and mobility aids like a walker or wheelchair are beneficial to patient's condition.[7]\nSurgical options could be considered in rare instances, in order to help with joint contractures or scoliosis.[7] Contractures of the legs can be alleviated with heel-cord surgery followed by bracing and regular physical therapy. Repeated surgeries to lengthen the heel cords may be needed as the child grows to adulthood.[4]",
    "Epidemiology": "According to a Japanese study from 2007, Bethlem myopathy 1 affects about 1 in 200,000 people.[8] A 2009 study, concerning the prevalence of genetic muscle disease in Northern England, estimated the prevalence of Bethlem myopathy 1 to be at 0.77:100,000.[27] Together with Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy 1, Bethlem myopathy 1 is believed to be underdiagnosed. Both conditions have been described in individuals from a variety of ethnic backgrounds.[28] Bethlem myopathy 2 affects less than 1 in 1,000,000 people.[9]"

    "Disease": "Bile acid synthesis disorders",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Bile Acid Synthesis Disorders present a range of symptoms, often beginning in infancy or early childhood. Jaundice, characterized by yellowing of the skin and eyes, is a common early sign.[4][5] Growth deficiencies are prevalent, with affected individuals often failing to meet weight and height milestones due to malabsorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, E, and K.[1][4][5] This can lead to Vitamin deficiencies, resulting in vision problems (vitamin A), rickets (vitamin D), neurological issues (vitamin E), and blood coagulation problems (vitamin K).[4]  Liver-related symptoms include hepatomegaly (enlarged liver) and splenomegaly (enlarged spleen), with elevated liver enzymes indicating liver dysfunction.[5] Patients may experience cholestasis, a condition where bile flow is interrupted, leading to pale stools, dark urine, and sometimes severe itching.[6] Steatorrhea, or excess fat in stools, is another symptom due to impaired fat digestion.[1][3] In severe cases, BASDs can progress to liver failure if untreated. The variability in symptom onset and severity depends on the specific genetic defect involved.[3]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosing Bile Acid Synthesis Disorders (BASDs) requires a comprehensive approach due to their rarity and symptom overlap with other liver diseases. Physicians begin by suspecting BASDs in infants or children presenting with jaundice, unexplained liver disease, or fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies.[1] Initial laboratory tests often include measuring serum bile acids.[7]\nAdvanced diagnostic techniques involve mass spectrometry, Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS), to analyze bile acid profiles in urine and blood.[8] These methods identify atypical bile acids and intermediates that accumulate due to enzyme deficiencies. Fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) is another technique used to detect specific bile acid patterns indicative of BASDs.[7][3] Genetic testing confirms the diagnosis by identifying mutations in genes responsible for bile acid synthesis enzymes.[9]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment for BASDs primarily involves oral bile acid replacement therapy. Cholic acid, approved in 2015, is the standard treatment for patients with single enzyme defects and peroxisomal disorders.[6] This therapy compensates for the lack of primary bile acids, restoring normal liver function and improving symptoms like jaundice and malabsorption.[10][3]\nIn some cases, ursodeoxycholic acid may be used alongside cholic acid to enhance bile flow, although it is ineffective as a sole treatment. The dosage of cholic acid is carefully monitored to suppress abnormal metabolite production and improve liver biochemistry.[3][10]\nFor patients unresponsive to medical therapy or with advanced liver disease, liver transplantation may be necessary. Early intervention with cholic acid has been shown to prevent progression to liver failure and improve long-term health outcomes, allowing many patients to lead normal lives into adulthood.[6]",
    "Epidemiology": "Bile Acid Synthesis Disorders are rare conditions with limited epidemiological data available.  The overall prevalence of BASDs is estimated to be between 1-9 cases per 1,000,000 people in the general population. However, this figure likely underestimates the true prevalence due to underdiagnosis and lack of awareness among healthcare providers.\nBASDs are thought to account for approximately 1-2% of all childhood cholestatic disorders.[1] In Europe, a study found a minimum estimated combined prevalence of 1.13 cases per 10 million people for two common types of BASDs\nThese disorders affect males and females equally and can occur in individuals of any race or ethnicity.[1] The age of onset varies, with presentations possible in infancy, childhood, or adulthood, depending on the specific type of BASD."

    "Disease": "Biliary atresia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Initially, the symptoms of biliary atresia are indistinguishable from those of neonatal jaundice, a usually harmless condition commonly seen in infants. However, infants with biliary atresia develop progressive conjugated jaundice, pale white stools, dark urine, and an enlarged palpable liver. Some infants fail to thrive as there will be a degree of fat and fat-soluble vitamin malabsorption (e.g. Vitamin K). This may cause a bleeding tendency. Eventually, and usually after 2 months, cirrhosis with portal hypertension will develop. If left untreated, biliary atresia can lead to liver failure. Unlike other forms of jaundice, however, biliary-atresia-related cholestasis mostly does not result in kernicterus, a form of brain damage resulting from liver dysfunction. This is because in biliary atresia, the liver, although diseased, is still able to conjugate bilirubin, and conjugated bilirubin is unable to cross the blood–brain barrier.[12]",
    "Causes": "The cause of biliary atresia in most infants is not fully understood and it is well possible that a number of factors may play a role, but especially maternal rotavirus infection during pregnancy and subsequent transmission of the virus to the child resulting in infection of the biliary epithelium and subsequent occluding fibrosis may be important in this respect.[13] Some cases may relate to infection with other viruses such as  SARS-CoV-2, hepatotropic virus reovirus 3,[14] or congenital cytomegalovirus.[15] In addition, autoimmune processes may contribute to pathogenesis in some cases as well.[16] However, with regard to these alternative causation the experimental evidence remains rather weak.[17]\nAn association between biliary atresia and the ADD3 gene was first detected in Chinese populations through a genome-wide association study, and was confirmed in Thai Asians and Caucasians. A possible association with deletion of the gene GPC1, which encodes a glypican 1-a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, has been reported.[18] This gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 (2q37) and is involved in the regulation of inflammation and the Hedgehog gene.[citation needed]\nEgyptian infants with biliary atresia were found to have null GSTM1 genotype while all their mothers were heterozygous for GSTM1. Thus these infants may be protected in utero by their maternal detoxification system, yet once born they cannot handle the detoxification of an aflatoxin load.[citation needed]\nSome cases of biliary atresia may result from exposure to aflatoxin B1, and to a lesser extent aflatoxin B2 during late pregnancy. Intact maternal detoxification protects baby during intrauterine life, yet after delivery, the baby struggles with the aflatoxin in its blood and liver. Moreover, the baby feeds aflatoxin M1 from its mom, as aflatoxin M1 is the detoxification product of aflatoxin B1. It is a milder toxin that causes cholangitis in the baby.[19]\nThere are isolated examples of biliary atresia in animals. For instance, lambs born to sheep grazing on land contaminated with a weed (Red Crumbweed) developed biliary atresia at certain times. The plants were later found to contain a toxin, now called biliatresone[20] Studies are ongoing to determine whether there is a link between human cases of biliary atresia and toxins such as biliatresone. There are some indications that a metabolite of certain human gut bacteria may be similar to biliatresone.[21]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is made by an assessment of history, physical examination in conjunction with blood tests, a liver biopsy, and ultrasound scans imaging and is prompted by prolonged or persistent jaundice, with abnormalities in liver function tests. Ultrasound or other forms of imaging such as radio-isotope liver scans can also be used but final confirmation is usually only reached at the time of exploratory surgery.[citation needed] Ultrasonography will usually show an absent or abnormal gallbladder.[27]\nThe differential diagnoses are extensive and include: Alagille syndrome, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, Byler disease (progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis), Caroli disease, choledochal cyst, cholestasis, congenital cytomegalovirus disease, congenital herpes simplex virus infection, congenital rubella, congenital syphilis, congenital toxoplasmosis, cystic fibrosis, galactosemia, idiopathic neonatal hepatitis, lipid storage disorders, neonatal hemochromatosis, and total parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis.[28]",
    "Treatment": "Most (>95%) infants with biliary atresia will undergo an operation designed to retain and salvage the native liver, restore bile flow, and reduce the level of jaundice. This is known as the Kasai procedure (after Morio Kasai, the Japanese surgeon who first developed the technique) or hepatoportoenterostomy. Although the procedure is not thought of as curative, it may relieve jaundice and stop liver fibrosis, allowing normal growth and development. Published series from Japan, North America, and the UK show that bilirubin levels will fall to normal values in about 50-55% of infants, allowing 40-50% to retain their own liver to reach the age of 5 and 10 years (and beyond). Liver transplantation is an option for those children whose liver function and symptoms fail to respond to a Kasai operation.[29]\nRecent large-scale studies by Davenport et al. (Annals of Surgery, 2008) show that the age of the patient is not an absolute clinical factor affecting prognosis. The influence of age differs according to the disease etiology—i.e., whether biliary atresia is isolated, cystic (CBA), or accompanied by splenic malformation (BASM).[citation needed]\nIt is widely accepted that corticosteroid treatment after a Kasai operation, with or without choleretics and antibiotics, has a beneficial effect on postoperative bile flow and can clear jaundice, but there is currently no consensus on the ideal dosing and duration of steroid use.[30] Furthermore, it has been observed in many retrospective longitudinal studies that corticosteroid treatment does not seem to significantly prolong survival of the native liver or transplant-free survival.[31]",
    "Epidemiology": "Biliary atresia seems to affect females slightly more often than males, and Asians and African Americans more often than Caucasians. It is common for only one child in a pair of twins or within the same family to have the condition. There seems to be no link to medications or immunizations given immediately before or during pregnancy. Diabetes during pregnancy particularly during the first trimester seems to predispose to a number of distinct congenital abnormalities in the infant such as sacral agenesis, transposition of the great vessels and the syndromic form of biliary atresia.[32]"

    "Disease": "Biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The onset of signs and symptoms can occur at any age but is most common in childhood between the ages of 3 and 10.[4] Less commonly, it may present in early infancy or adulthood. The neurological symptoms usually present as episodes of increasing severity. A less common exhibition of BTBGD involves persistent symptoms, rather than recurrent episodes.[4] In these cases, fewer symptoms are usually present, with their severity slowly increasing over time.[citation needed]\nRecurrent subacute encephalopathy is the most commonly observed symptom, followed by dystonia, both of which are nearly always present. Additional observed symptoms include spasticity or cogwheel rigidity, seizures, difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), ataxia, slurred speech (dysarthria), ophthalmoplegia, opisthotonus, facial palsy, confusion, hyperreflexia, Babinski responses, and ankle clonus.[5]\nIn early infancy, the presentation of BTBGD is considered as Leigh-like syndrome or atypical infantile spasms.[5] It is characterized by acute encephalopathy, vomiting, metabolic acidosis (specifically lactic acidosis), and poor feeding during the first 3 months of life.[1][5]\nPresentation of late-onset BTBGD is considered a Wernicke-like encephalopathy.[1][5] It is characterized by ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, double vision (diplopia), rapid and uncontrollable eye movement (nystagmus), status seizures, and droopy eyelid (ptosis). The onset of signs and symptoms for adulthood presentation occurs during or after the second decade of life.[citation needed]",
    "Causes": "SLC19A3 gene mutations cause BTBGD.[4] SLC19A3 is a gene on chromosome 2q36.3 that encodes the protein thiamine transporter 2.[4][5] Thiamine transporter 2 moves thiamine (vitamin B1) into cells, which is essential for nervous system functioning. Mutations of the gene encoding this protein (SLC19A3) are likely to impair the functioning of this protein and inhibit the transportation and absorption of thiamine.[citation needed]\nThe role of biotin in BTBGD is unclear.[4]\nEpisodes of symptoms can be triggered by several things:[5]",
    "Diagnosis": "BTBGD can be diagnosed based on brain imaging and confirmed with genetic testing.[9] Additional diagnostic tools include laboratory testing of biological fluids and reviewing autosomal recessive inheritance in the family history.[citation needed]\nThe MRI of individuals with BTBGD may reveal lesions on the basal ganglia and central bilateral necrosis in the caudate nucleus and putamen.[7][10] Vasogenic edema is also characteristic of BTBGD.[5] Additional MRI findings include high T2 signal intensity with possible swelling in basal ganglia, and abnormal diffuse involvement of the subcortical white matter, cortical, and infratentorial brain.[5][11] Involvement in the thalami, brain stem, and cerebellum may also be observed.[11]\nMolecular genetic tests that can be performed for BTBGD include:[5]\nOther disorders that present similar clinical findings include:[5]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment of BTBGD is done to manage specific symptoms and concerns.[5] If left untreated, the disease can be fatal. Treatment may vary by symptom, though it is common to administer thiamine (up to 40 mg/kg/day) and sometimes biotin (5-10 mg/kg/day) orally. This treatment is specifically used to address neurological symptoms and can reverse these symptoms if taken early enough. Biotin and thiamine oral therapy must continue throughout the entirety of the individual's life.[5] Other symptomatic treatments include anti-seizure medication to treat seizures and trihexyphenidyl or L-dopa to treat dystonia. Rehab and therapy are used for developmental and social concerns.[citation needed]\nManagement of BTBGD includes prevention of symptoms and routine surveillance.[5] Avoiding stressors is essential in managing BTBGD since stress and trauma can trigger episodes. Fevers are also triggers, so fever control is important. Other triggers that should be avoided include infections and excessive exercise. Routine surveillance should include evaluation of the individual's nervous system, education and development, and any other relevant areas.[citation needed]",
    "Epidemiology": "The prevalence of BTBGD is unknown.[4] Of the reported cases, it is predominately observed in individuals from Arab populations."

    "Disease": "Biotinidase deficiency",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of a biotinidase deficiency (BTD) can appear several days after birth. These include seizures, hypotonia and muscle/limb weakness, ataxia, paresis, hearing loss, optic atrophy, skin rashes (including seborrheic dermatitis and psoriasis), and alopecia. If left untreated, the disorder can rapidly lead to coma and death.[citation needed]\nNeonates with BTD may not exhibit any signs, and symptoms typically appear after the first few weeks or months of life. If left untreated, around 70% of infants with BTD will experience seizures (staring spells, jerking limb movements, stiffness, flickering eyelids), which often act as the first symptom of BTD. Infants with BTD may also have weak muscles and hypotonia; this may cause infants to appear abnormally \"floppy\" and have affected feeding and motor skills. BTD may result in developmental delays, vision or hearing problems, eye infections, alopecia, and eczema. The urine of infants with BTD may contain lactic acid and ammonia. Other symptoms that infants may exhibit include ataxia, breathing issues, lethargy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and speech problems. The condition may eventually result in a coma and death.[1]\nBiotinidase deficiency can also appear later in life. This is referred to as \"late-onset\" biotinidase deficiency. The symptoms are similar, but perhaps more mild, because if an individual survives the neonatal period, they likely have some residual activity of biotin-related enzymes. Studies[2][3] have noted individuals who were asymptomatic until adolescence or early adulthood. One study pointed out that untreated individuals may not exhibit symptoms until age 21.[4] Furthermore, in rare cases, even individuals with profound deficiencies of biotinidase can be asymptomatic.[2]\nSymptom severity is predictably correlated with the severity of the enzyme defect. Profound biotinidase deficiency refers to situations where enzyme activity is 10% or less.[3] Individuals with partial biotinidase deficiency may have enzyme activity of 10–30%.[3]\nFunctionally, there is no significant difference between dietary biotin deficiency and genetic loss of biotin-related enzyme activity. In both cases, supplementation with biotin can often restore normal metabolic function and proper catabolism of leucine and isoleucine.[citation needed]\nThe symptoms of biotinidase deficiency (and dietary deficiency of biotin) can be quite severe. A 2004 case study from Metametrix[5] detailed the effects of biotin deficiency, including aggression, cognitive delay, and reduced immune function.",
    "Diagnosis": "Biotinidase deficiency can be found by genetic testing.  This is often done at birth as part of newborn screening in several states throughout the United States.  Results are found through testing a small amount of blood gathered through a heel prick of the infant.  As not all states require that this test be done, it is often skipped in those where such testing is not required.  Biotinidase deficiency can also be found by sequencing the BTD gene, particularly in those with a family history or known familial gene mutation.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment is possible, but unless continued daily, problems may arise. Currently, this is accomplished through daily supplementation of 5–10 mg of oral biotin. If symptoms have started, standard treatments can take care of them, such as hearing aids for poor hearing.[citation needed]",

    "Disease": "Bladder exstrophy",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The classic manifestation of bladder exstrophy presents with:[citation needed]\nFemales frequently have a displaced and narrowed  vaginal orifice, a bifid clitoris, and divergent labia.[3]",
    "Causes": "The cause is not yet clinically established but is thought to be in part due to failed reinforcement of the cloacal membrane by underlying mesoderm.[4]",
    "Diagnosis": "In a small retrospective study of 25 pregnancies, five factors were found to be strongly associated with a prenatal diagnosis of bladder exstrophy:[4]\nWhile a diagnosis of bladder exstrophy was made retrospectively in a majority of pregnancies, in only three cases was a prenatal diagnosis made.[5]",
    "Treatment": "The extreme rarity of the disease limits the surgical opportunities to practice the complex closure required in these patients. For this reason, patients have the best outcomes when the bladder closures are performed at high volume centers where surgical and nursing teams have extensive experience in caring for the disease.[6] The highest volume center in the United States, and the world, is the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland; they have seen over 1300 exstrophy patients in the past 50 years.[7]\nUpon delivery, the exposed bladder is irrigated and a non-adherent film is placed to prevent as much contact with the external environment as possible. In the event the child was not born at a medical center with an appropriate exstrophy support team then transfer will likely follow. Upon transfer, or for those infants born at a medical center able to care for bladder exstrophy, imaging may take place in the first few hours of life prior to the child undergoing surgery.[3]\nPrimary (immediate) closure is indicated only in those patients with a bladder of appropriate size, elasticity, and contractility as those patients are most likely to develop a bladder of adequate capacity after early surgical intervention.[8]\nConditions that are absolute contraindications despite bladder adequacy include duplication of the penis or scrotum and significant bilateral hydronephrosis.[9]\nModern therapy is aimed at surgical reconstruction of the bladder and genitalia. Both males and females are born with this anomaly. Treatment is similar.\nIn males treatments have been:\nIn the modern staged repair of exstrophy (MSRE) the initial step is closure of the abdominal wall, often requiring a pelvic osteotomy. This leaves the patient with penile epispadias and urinary incontinence. At approximately 2–3 years of age, the patient then undergoes repair of the epispadias after testosterone stimulation. Finally, bladder neck repair usually occurs around the age of 4–5 years, though this is dependent upon a bladder with adequate capacity and, most importantly, an indication that the child is interested in becoming continent. In some of the bladder reconstructions, the bladder is augmented with the addition of a segment of the large intestines to increase the volume capacity of the reconstructed bladder.[citation needed]\nIn the complete primary repair of exstrophy (CPRE) the bladder closure is combined with an epispadias repair, in an effort to decrease costs and morbidity.[10] This technique has, however, led to significant loss of penile and corporal tissue, particularly in younger patients.[11]\nIn females treatment has included:\nSurgical reconstruction of the clitoris, which is separated into two distinct bodies. Surgical reconstruction to correct the split of the mons, redefine the structure of the bladder neck and urethra. Vaginoplasty will correct the anteriorly displaced vagina. If the anus is involved, it is also repaired. Fertility remains and women who were born with bladder exstrophy usually develop prolapse due to the weaker muscles of the pelvic floor.[12]",
    "Prognosis": "The most important criterion for improving long-term prognosis is success of the initial closure.[21][22] If a patient requires more than one closure their chance of continence drops off precipitously with each additional closure - at just two closures the chance of voiding continence is just 17%.[23]\nEven with successful surgery, people may have long-term complications.[24] Some of the most common include:",
    "Epidemiology": "Occurring at a rate between 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 50,000 [25] with a male-to-female ratio of 2.3–6:1,[26][27][28] bladder exstrophy is relatively rare. For those individuals with bladder exstrophy who maintain their ability to reproduce, the risk of bladder exstrophy in their children is approximately 500-fold greater than the general population.[26]"

    "Disease": "Bronchopulmonary dysplasia",
    "Causes": "Prolonged high oxygen delivery in premature infants causes necrotizing bronchiolitis and alveolar septal injury, with inflammation and scarring. This results in hypoxemia. Today, with the advent of surfactant therapy and high frequency ventilation and oxygen supplementation, infants with BPD experience much milder injury without necrotizing bronchiolitis or alveolar septal fibrosis. Instead, there are usually uniformly dilated acini with thin alveolar septa and little or no interstitial fibrosis. It develops most commonly in the first four weeks after birth.[9] Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is now known to be due to abnormal wound healing in response to injury;[10] it has been linked to alterations in the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.[11][12]",
    "Diagnosis": "The classic diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia may be assigned at 28 days of life if the following criteria are met:[citation needed]\nThe 2006 National Institute of Health (US) criteria for BPD (for neonates treated with more than 21% oxygen for at least 28 days)[13] is as follows:[14][15]",
    "Treatment": "Infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia are often treated with diuretics that decrease fluid in the alveoli where gas exchange occurs and bronchodilators that relax the airway muscles to facilitate breathing.[16] To alleviate bronchopulmonary dysplasia, caffeine is another commonly used treatment that reduces inflammation and increases lung volume thereby improving extubation success and decreasing the duration of mechanical ventilation.[17] Viral immunization is important for these children who have a higher risk of infections in the respiratory tract.[18]\nThere is evidence that steroids (systemic corticosteroid treatment) given to babies less than seven days old can prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia.[19] This treatment increases the risk of neurodevelopmental sequelae (cerebral palsy) and gastrointestinal perforation.[19]\nFor babies seven days old and older, \"late systemic postnatal corticosteroid treatment\" may reduce the risk of death and of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.[20] There is some evidence that this treatment does not increase the risk of cerebral palsy, however, long-term studies considering the neurodevelopmental outcomes is needed to further understand the risk of this treatment option.[20] Late systemic postnatal corticosteroid treatment is therefore only recommended for babies seven days old or older who cannot be taken off of a ventilator.[20] The benefit and risks of systemic corticosteroid treatment in older babies who are not intubated (on a ventilator) is not known.[20]\nVitamin A treatment in low birth weight babies may improve the 36-week mortality risk, decrease the days of mechanical ventilation, and decrease the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.[21]\nOxygen therapy at home is recommended in those with significant low oxygen levels.[22]\nHypercarbia (too much carbon dioxide in the blood) may contribute to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.[23] Monitoring the level of carbon dioxide in neonatal infants to ensure that the level is not too high or too low (hypocarbia) is important for improving outcomes for neonates in intensive care.[24]  Carbon dioxide can be monitored by taking a blood sample (arterial blood gas), through the breath (exhalation), and it can be measured continuously through the skin by using a minimally invasive transcutaneous device.[24] The most effective and safest approach for measuring carbon dioxide in newborn infants is not clear.[24]\nIt is not clear if treatment with superoxide dimutase supplementation is effective at preventing bronchopulmonary dysplasia in infants born preterm or at reducing preterm infant mortality.[25]",

    "Disease": "Camurati%E2%80%93Engelmann disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Patients with CED complain of chronic bone pain in the legs or arms, muscle weakness (myopathy) and experience a waddling gait. Other clinical problems associated with the disease include increased fatigue, weakness, muscle spasms, headache, difficulty gaining weight, and delay in puberty.  Some patients have an abnormal or absent tibia, may present with a flat foot, or have scoliosis.[1]\nThis disease may also cause bones to become abnormally hardened which is referred to as sclerosis. This hardening may affect the bones at the base of the skull or those in the hands, feet, or jaw. This causes ongoing pain and aching within the body parts that are affected. The pain has been described as either a hot electric stabbing pain, an ever-increasing pressure sensation around the bones (especially before electrical storms) or as a constant ache that radiates through several long bones at once. Pain may also occur in the hips, wrists, knees and other joints as they essentially lock up (often becoming very stiff, immobile and sore), mostly when walking up or down staircases, writing for extended periods of time, or during the colder months of the year. Those with the disease tend to have a very characteristic walk medically diagnosed as a 'waddling gait'. This is observed by the broad-based gait with a duck-like waddle to the swing phase, the pelvis drops to the side of the leg being raised, notable forward curvature of the lumbar spine and a marked body swing.[5][6]\nThe pain is especially severe during a flare-up, which can be unpredictable, exhausting and last anywhere from a few hours to several weeks. This is a common occurrence for several CED patients, often causing myopathy and extensive sleep deprivation from the chronic, severe and disabling pain. Patients may even require the use of a wheelchair (or additional carer's help with getting dressed, showering, mobility/shopping, preparing meals or lifting heavy items) especially when bedridden or housebound for days or weeks at a time. Flare-ups may be attributed to, or exacerbated by growth spurts, stress, exhaustion, exercise, standing or walking for too long, illness, infection, being accidentally knocked/hurt or injured, after surgery/anaesthetics, cold weather, electrical storms, and sudden changes in barometric pressure.[medical citation needed]\nCED may also affect internal organs, the liver and spleen, which may become enlarged.[medical citation needed] A loss of vision and/or hearing can occur if bones are adversely affected by the hardening in the skull. Hence proactive specialist check-ups, X-rays, diagnostic tests/scans, and regular blood tests are recommended on an annual basis to monitor the CED bony growth and secondary medical issues that may arise from this condition.[7]",
    "Causes": "Camurati-Engelmann disease is caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the gene TGFB1, localized at chromosome 19q13.[8]",
    "Diagnosis": "There are two forms:\nType 1 Camurati-Engelmann Disease is associated with an error occurring in the TGFB1 protein.  Affected individuals shared a haplotype between D19S881 to D19S606.[10]  TGFB1 protein is encoded by the TGF-B1 gene, which occurs on chromosome 19q13.1-13.3.[11]  This protein is responsible for a multitude of functions, one of which includes regulating the function of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, which decreases bone resorption and increases bone formation.[12]  These functions can be affected by a series of mutations that occur on exon 4, near the carboxyl terminus of the latency associated peptide, or LAP.[13]  TGFB1 is expressed as a latent form, a mature form and a B1-LAP.  Mutations to R218H affect the association of the B1-LAP and the mature form of TGFB1 by conformational changes to B1-LAP.[12]  These mutations can lead to a buildup of mature TGFB1, which accumulates in the mutant R218H fibroblasts.  Fibroblasts are a type of cell that creates collagen and the extracellular matrix.  This suggests that R218H mutation causes a disassociation between mature-TGFB1 and B1-LAP.[12]  Mutations at the LLL12-13ins and Y81H regions decrease the secretion of TGFB1, which leads to intracellular buildup of TGFB1.[14]\nType 2 Camurati-Engelmann Disease is still speculative, with no distinct evidence to credit its existence.  There are many similarities between Type 2 CED and hyperostosis generalisata with striations of the bones (HGS), with some speculating they are two phenotypic variations of the same disease.[15]",
    "Treatment": "Camurati–Engelmann disease is somewhat treatable. Glucocorticosteroids, which are anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents, are used in some cases.  This form of medication helps in bone strength; however, it can have multiple side effects.  In several reports, successful treatment with glucocorticosteroids was described, as certain side effects can benefit a person with CED. This drug helps with pain and fatigue as well as some correction of radiographic abnormalities.[16]\nAlternative treatments such as massage, relaxation techniques (meditation, essential oils, spa baths, music therapy, etc.), gentle stretching, and especially heat therapy have been successfully used to an extent in conjunction with pain medications. A majority of CED patients require some form of analgesics, muscle relaxant, and/or sleep inducing medication to manage the pain, specifically if experiencing frequent or severe flare-ups (e.g. during winter).[17]"

    "Disease": "Canavan disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The signs and symptoms of the most common (and most serious) form of Canavan disease typically appear in early infancy usually between the first three to six months of age.[4] Canavan disease then progresses rapidly from that stage, with typical cases involving intellectual disability, loss of previously acquired motor skills, feeding difficulties, abnormal muscle tone (i.e., initial floppiness – hypotonia – that may eventually translate into spasticity), poor head control, and megalocephaly (abnormally enlarged head). Paralysis, blindness, or seizures may also occur.[4]\nThere exists a much less common variant of Canavan disease which is generally much less serious and involves later onset of symptoms, which are often mild and nonspecific enough to go unrecognized as manifestations of Canavan's disease.[5] This variant does not seem to have any effect on lifespan and is typically limited to minor cases of speech and motor skill development delay.[6]",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of neonatal/infantile Canavan disease relies on the demonstration of a very high concentration of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) in the urine. In mild/juvenile Canavan disease, NAA may only be slightly elevated; thus, the diagnosis relies on molecular genetic testing of ASPA, the gene encoding the enzyme aspartoacylase.[9]",
    "Treatment": "No cure for Canavan disease is known, nor is there a standard course of treatment. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Physical therapy may help improve motor skills, and educational programs may help improve communication skills. Seizures are treated with antiepileptic drugs and gastrostomy is used to help maintain adequate food intake and hydration when swallowing difficulties exist.[10] Also, an experimental treatment uses lithium citrate. When a person has Canavan disease, their levels of N-acetylaspartate are chronically elevated. The lithium citrate was proven in a rat genetic model of Canavan disease to decrease levels of N-acetyl aspartate significantly. When tested on a human, the subject's condition reversed during a two-week wash-out period after withdrawal of lithium.[citation needed]\nThe investigation revealed both decreased N-acetylaspartate levels in regions of the brain tested and magnetic resonance spectroscopic values that are more characteristic of normal development and myelination. This evidence suggests that a larger controlled trial of lithium may be warranted as supportive therapy for children with Canavan disease.[11]\nExperimental gene therapy trial results, published in 2002, used a healthy gene to take over for the defective one that causes Canavan disease.[12]\nIn human trials, the results of which were published in 2012, this method appeared to improve the patient's life without long-term adverse effects during a five-year follow-up.[13]",
    "Prognosis": "Canavan disease typically results in death or development of life-threatening conditions by the age of ten, though life expectancy is variable,[14] and is highly dependent on specific circumstances.[15] On the other hand, the milder variants of the disorder seem not to have any effect on lifespan.[6]",
    "Epidemiology": "Although Canavan disease may occur in any ethnic group, it mostly affects people of Eastern European Jewish ancestry with about one in 40 (2.5%) individuals of Eastern European (Ashkenazi) Jewish ancestry being a carrier.[16]"

    "Disease": "Caroli disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The first symptoms typically include fever, intermittent abdominal pain, and an enlarged liver. Occasionally, yellow discoloration of the skin occurs.[4] Caroli disease usually occurs in the presence of other diseases, such as autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, cholangitis, gallstones, biliary abscess, sepsis, liver cirrhosis, kidney failure, and cholangiocarcinoma (7% affected).[2] People with Caroli disease are 100 times more at risk for cholangiocarcinoma than the general population.[4] After recognizing symptoms of related diseases, Caroli disease can be diagnosed.[citation needed]\nMorbidity is common and is caused by complications of cholangitis, sepsis, choledocholithiasis, and cholangiocarcinoma.[5] These morbid conditions often prompt the diagnosis. Portal hypertension may be present, resulting in other conditions including enlarged spleen, hematemesis, and melena.[6] These problems can severely affect the patient's quality of life. In a 10-year period between 1995 and 2005, only 10 patients were surgically treated for Caroli disease, with an average patient age of 45.8 years.[5]\nAfter reviewing 46 cases of Caroli disease before 1990,  21.7% of the cases were the result of an intrahepatic cyst or nonobstructive biliary tree dilation, 34.7% were linked with congenital hepatic fibrosis, 13% were isolated choledochal cystic dilation, and the remaining 24.6% had a combination of all three.[7]",
    "Causes": "The cause appears to be genetic; the simple form is an autosomal dominant trait, while the complex form is an autosomal recessive trait.[2] Females are more prone to Caroli disease than males.[8] Family history may include kidney and liver disease due to the link between Caroli disease and ARPKD.[6] PKHD1, the gene linked to ARPKD, has been found mutated in patients with Caroli syndrome. PKHD1 is expressed primarily in the kidneys with lower levels in the liver, pancreas, and lungs, a pattern consistent with phenotype of the disease, which primarily affects the liver and kidneys.[2][6] The genetic basis for the difference between Caroli disease and Caroli syndrome has not been defined.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "Modern imaging techniques allow the diagnosis to be made more easily and without invasive imaging of the biliary tree.[9]  Commonly, the disease is limited to the left lobe of the liver. Images taken by CT scan, X-ray, or MRI  show enlarged intrahepatic (in the liver) bile ducts due to ectasia. Using an ultrasound, tubular dilation of the bile ducts can be seen. On a CT scan, Caroli disease can be observed by noting the many fluid-filled, tubular structures extending to the liver.[4] A high-contrast CT must be used to distinguish the difference between stones and widened ducts. Bowel gas and digestive habits make it difficult to obtain a clear sonogram, so a CT scan is a good substitution. When the intrahepatic bile duct wall has protrusions, it is clearly seen as central dots or a linear streak.[10] Caroli disease is commonly diagnosed after this “central dot sign” is detected on a CT scan or ultrasound.[10] However, cholangiography is the best, and final, approach to show the enlarged bile ducts as a result of Caroli disease.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "The treatment depends on clinical features and the location of the biliary abnormality. When the disease is localized to one hepatic lobe, hepatectomy relieves symptoms and appears to remove the risk of malignancy.[11] Good evidence suggests that malignancy complicates Caroli disease in roughly 7% of cases.[11]\nAntibiotics are used to treat the inflammation of the bile duct, and ursodeoxycholic acid is used for hepatolithiasis.[9] Ursodiol is given to treat cholelithiasis. In diffuse cases of Caroli disease, treatment options include conservative or endoscopic therapy, internal biliary bypass procedures, and liver transplantation in carefully selected cases.[11] Surgical resection has been used successfully in patients with monolobar disease.[9] An orthotopic liver transplant is another option, used only when antibiotics have no effect, in combination with recurring cholangitis. With a liver transplant, cholangiocarcinoma is usually avoided in the long run.[12]\nFamily studies are necessary to determine if Caroli disease is due to inheritable causes. Regular follow-ups, including ultrasounds and liver biopsies, are performed.[citation needed]",
    "Prognosis": "Mortality is indirect and caused by complications. After cholangitis occurs, patients typically die within 5–10 years.[3]",
    "Epidemiology": "Caroli disease is typically found in Asia, and diagnosed in persons under the age of 22. Cases have also been found in infants and adults. As medical imaging technology improves, diagnostic age decreases.[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "Catamenial pneumothorax",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Symptoms include chest or shoulder pain, cough, dyspnea, and shortness of breath.[6] Chest and shoulder pain can be radiating out to the shoulder blades. A dry cough can also present and come with a \"crackling\" sound upon inhaling.[1] Typically, it occurs in women aged 30 to 40 years, but it has been diagnosed in young girls as early as 10 years of age and post menopausal women (exclusively in women of menstrual age), most with a history of pelvic endometriosis.[7] Chest pain requires immediate medical attention.",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis can be hinted by high recurrence rates of lung collapse in a woman of reproductive age with endometriosis.  CA-125 is elevated.\nClinical diagnosis can be made based on history and imaging, while the gold standard for definitive diagnosis remains Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, or VATS, which allows not only the visualization of the lesion, but also surgical treatment via cauterization of the ectopic endometrial tissue. Special staining under a microscope or utilizing a cell marker, such as PAX8, can be used to positively identify endometrial stroma.[6]\nCatamenial pneumothorax is the most common form of thoracic endometriosis syndrome, which also includes\ncatamenial hemothorax, catamenial hemoptysis, catamenial hemothorax and endometriosis lung nodules, as well as some exceptional presentations.[12][13]",
    "Treatment": "Surgery, hormonal treatments and combined approaches have all been proposed, with variable results in terms of short and long term outcome.[14] These have both been effective, separately and together. Both have been used to treat women with this condition, and specifics depend on each patient and each situation. Surgery may be used to excise endometrial tissue from the lungs and pleural space as well as repair damage and holes in the diaphragm.[1] Surgery may also be used to remove blisters (blebs). An additional procedure involves a mesh that is placed over the diaphragm to block any holes that may have been missed in the first surgery. Hormonal therapies can also be used to suppress ovulation. Surgical removal of the endometrial tissue should be endeavored during menstruation for optimal visualization.[15] Pleurodesis may also be effective in removing the space between the lung and the chest wall; preventing air build up between these layers.\nNon-surgical treatment includes pharmacological treatment via continuous oral contraceptive therapy to avoid cyclical bleeding with monthly menstruation. Oral contraceptives appear to be preferable for patients due to fewer negative side effects than treatment with GnRH agonist therapy, which can lead to hypoestrogenic effects including osteoporosis, resulting in discontinuation of therapy and thus a higher likelihood of recurrence of catamenial pneumothorax.[6]",
    "Epidemiology": "Some sources claim this entity represents 3 to 6% of pneumothorax in women.[16] In regard of the low incidence of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (i.e. not due to surgical trauma etc.) in women (about 1/100'000/year),[16] this is a very rare condition. Hence, many basic textbooks do not mention it, and many doctors have never heard of it. Therefore, catamenial pneumothorax is probably under-recognized.[17]"

    "Disease": "Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Although individuals with CPVT may not experience any symptoms, the most commonly reported symptoms are blackouts or sudden loss of consciousness, referred to as syncope.[1] These blackouts often occur during exercise or as a response to emotional stress—situations in which chemical messengers known as catecholamines, such as adrenaline, are released within the body. Blackouts may be misinterpreted as being caused by simple faints or epilepsy, often leading to delays in reaching the correct diagnosis.[7] In a third of those affected, the first manifestation of the disease may be cardiac arrest, potentially leading to sudden death.[8] This can occur in very young children, presenting as sudden infant death syndrome or 'cot death'.[1] Approximately 30% of those with CPVT will have a family member who has experienced blackouts, seizures, or sudden death in response to exercise or stress.[7]\nIn those with CPVT, catecholamine release can lead to an abnormal heart rhythm or arrhythmia known as ventricular tachycardia.[4] The ventricular tachycardia may take a characteristic form known as bidirectional ventricular tachycardia. This form of ventricular tachycardia occurs relatively infrequently, but if seen is suggestive of an underlying diagnosis of CPVT or the related condition Andersen-Tawil syndrome.[8][9] These ventricular arrhythmias in some cases terminate by themselves, causing a blackout from which the person then recovers. However, if the abnormal heart rhythm continues, it can degenerate into a more dangerous arrhythmia known as ventricular fibrillation causing a cardiac arrest and, if untreated, sudden death.[10]\nThere are typically very few abnormal signs on clinical examination in persons with CPVT. However, those with CPVT may develop a less serious heart rhythm disturbance called atrial fibrillation, which can be detected on examination as an irregular pulse.[8] Furthermore, approximately 20% of those with CPVT have a slow resting heart rate known as a sinus bradycardia.[4]",
    "Causes": "CPVT can be caused by mutations in several genes, all of which are responsible for regulating the concentrations of calcium within cardiac muscle cells. The most commonly identified genetic mutation in CPVT is a mutation in the RYR2 gene that encodes the cardiac ryanodine receptor, responsible for releasing calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.[16] Mutations associated with CPVT have also been identified in the CASQ2 gene which encodes calsequestrin,[17] a protein that binds calcium within the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Other genes associated with rarer, atypical forms of CPVT[16] include TECRL encoding Trans-2,3-enoyl-CoA reductase-like protein, CALM1, CALM2 and CALM3 all encoding Calmodulin, and TRDN encoding Triadin.[18]\nThe most commonly identified genetic mutations in those with CPVT occur in the RYR2 gene which encodes the cardiac ryanodine receptor.[11] Mutations in this gene lead to an autosomal dominant form of typical CPVT known as CPVT1.[16] While the precise effect differs between specific mutations in this gene, many RYR2 mutations cause the ryanodine receptor to open in response to lower concentrations of calcium—the threshold for calcium release is lower.[11] As a result, the sarcoplasmic reticulum spontaneously releases calcium through these abnormal ryanodine receptors when the concentration of calcium within the sarcoplasmic reticulum rises, a process known as store-overload induced calcium release.[10] Sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium content increases in response to stimulation from catecholamines, explaining why arrhythmias in those with CPVT occur at times when catecholamine levels are elevated. Some suggest that the increased sensitivity to calcium occurs only when the ryanodine receptor is phosphorylated by protein kinase A, while other suggest that the increased sensitivity also occurs under resting conditions.[11]\nTwo theories have been proposed for the underlying mechanism by which mutations in RYR2 promote store-overload induced calcium release: domain unzipping and FKBP12.6 unbinding.[10] Domain unzipping refers to the separation of two important regions of the ryanodine receptor, the N-terminus and the central domain. Through this mechanism, a mutation might destabilise the ryanodine receptor's closed state and increase its sensitivity to calcium.[10] A second potential mechanism involves the regulatory protein FKBP12.6, a protein that binds to and stabilises the ryanodine receptor. The binding of FKBP12.6 to the ryanodine receptor is regulated by phosphorylation. Phosphorylation by protein kinase A leads to the dissociation of FKBP12.6, rendering the ryanodine receptor more sensitive to cytosolic calcium. RYR2 mutations may interfere with the binding of FKB12.6 to the ryanodine receptor and thereby increase sensitivity to calcium. It is likely that FKBP12.6 plays a role in some CPVT mutations but not others.[10]\nRYR2 mutations responsible for CPVT are mainly found in four major domains of the gene.[10] Mutations affecting domains III and IV of the gene (corresponding to the N-terminal region of the protein and cytosolic linker respectively) occur in 46% of cases. Mutations are seen less frequently affecting domains I and II, both of which encode sections of the N-terminal region of the protein.[10] RYR2 mutations associated with CPVT that occur outside these four domains are very rare, being responsible for as few as 10% of reported cases. RYR2 mutations are most often missense mutations, such as single nucleotide substitutions causing one amino acid to be replaced by another, although in-frame substitutions and duplications have been described. More damaging nonsense mutations have not been reported in association with CPVT, potentially because these variants may lead to different cardiac diseases such as cardiomyopathies.[10]\nMutations in the CASQ2 gene are associated with an autosomal recessive form of typical CPVT known as CPVT2.[16] This gene encodes calsequestrin, the major calcium-binding protein and calcium buffer within the sarcoplasmic reticulum.[19][20] Mutations in CASQ2 account for only 3-5% of cases of CPVT.[16] Fourteen mutations in CASQ2 have been identified in association with CPVT. Two of these are nonsense mutations causing the protein to be abnormally short, and two are deletion mutations, while ten are missense mutations that substitute one amino acid for another in the chain forming the protein.[11]\nMutations in CASQ2 cause a decrease in sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium-buffering capacity. This means that abrupt changes in sarcoplasmic total calcium will be buffered less and therefore translate to larger shifts in free calcium. The higher peaks in free calcium have greater potential to cause store-overload induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, leading to afterdepolarisations.[10]\nIn addition to its role as a calcium buffer, calsequestrin also regulates the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum by directly modulating ryanodine receptors. When the concentration of calcium is low, calsequestrin monomers form a complex with the proteins triadin and junctin, which inhibit ryanodine receptors.[19] However, at high calcium concentrations, calsequestrin forms polymers that dissociate from the ryanodine receptor channel complex, removing the inhibitory response and increasing the sensitivity of the ryanodine receptor to spontaneously releasing calcium.[10]\nDecreased CASQ2 is also associated with high levels of calreticulin, a protein which among other roles regulates the reuptake of calcium into the sarcoplasmic reticulum by SERCA.[21] In the absence of CASQ2, calreticulin levels increase and provide some compensatory calcium binding within the sarcoplasmic reticulum. It is possible that calreticulin may contribute to the generation of arrhythmias seen in association with CASQ2 mutations.[21]",
    "Diagnosis": "CPVT may be challenging to diagnose as the structure of the heart appears normal in those affected by the condition when assessed using an echocardiogram, cardiac MRI scan or cardiac CT scan, while the electrical function of the heart also appears normal at rest when assessed using a standard 12-lead ECG.[1][2] However, in response to exercise or catecholamines such as adrenaline, abnormal heart rhythms such as bidirectional ventricular tachycardia or frequent polymorphic ventricular ectopic beats may be seen.[22]\nThe resting 12-lead ECG is a useful test to differentiate CPVT from other electrical diseases of the heart that can cause similar abnormal heart rhythms. Unlike conditions such as long QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome, the resting 12-lead ECG in those with CPVT is generally normal.[8] However, approximately 20% of those affected have a slow resting heart rate or sinus bradycardia.[8]\nExercise testing, commonly performed on a treadmill or stationary bicycle, can help to diagnose CPVT. During the test, those with CPVT often experience ectopic beats, which may progress to bidirectional and then polymorphic ventricular tachycardia as the intensity of exercise increases.[23] Some of those suspected of having CPVT, such as young children, may not be able to perform an exercise tolerance test. In these cases, alternative forms of testing include adrenaline provocation testing, during which adrenaline is infused into a vein at gradually increasing doses under close supervision and ECG monitoring.[22] Additionally, long term or Holter ECG monitoring can be performed, although this form of testing is less likely to detect an arrhythmia. Invasive electrophysiological studies do not provide useful information to help diagnose CPVT or to assess the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias.[2][22]\nCPVT can also be diagnosed by identifying a disease-causing mutation in a gene associated with CPVT using genetic testing.[2][22] This technique may be the only way to identify the condition in someone suspected of having CPVT who has died, and in this case may be known as a molecular autopsy.[24]",
    "Treatment": "Treatments for CPVT aim to prevent lethal abnormal heart rhythms from occurring, and to rapidly restore a normal rhythm if they do occur. As the arrhythmias in CPVT generally occur at times when the heart is exposed to high levels of adrenaline or other similar chemical messengers (catecholamines), many treatments for CPVT aim to lower the levels of catecholamines the heart is exposed to or block their effects on the heart.[8]\nThe first-line treatment for those with CPVT involves lifestyle advice. This includes avoiding competitive sports, very strenuous exercise and highly stressful environments, as high levels of adrenaline can occur in these settings, which can provoke arrhythmias.[2]\nSeveral medications can be useful for those with CPVT. The mainstays of treatment are beta blockers, which block the effects of adrenaline and other catecholamines on the heart, reducing the chance of abnormal heart rhythms developing.[2] Of all the beta blockers, nadolol has been proven to be the most effective for treating CPVT.[25] This drug lowers the heart rate to a greater extent than other beta blockers and only needs to be taken once daily, reducing the risk of missed doses. Nadolol may be difficult to obtain and is not available in all countries, and an alternative beta blocker suitable for use in CPVT may be propranolol, which however has a more complex dosing regimen.[25] Recently published data suggest that the use of selective beta blockers, such as atenolol, bisoprolol, or metoprolol, is associated with very high treatment failure rates.[25]\nFlecainide is a class 1c antiarrhythmic drug that is recommended for those with CPVT who experience abnormal heart rhythms despite taking a beta blocker.[2] Flecainide reduces the risk of arrhythmias in those with CPVT, but it remains uncertain how Flecainide achieves this. Some have suggested that Flecainide directly interacts with the cardiac ryanodine receptor, which is frequently abnormal in those with CPVT, while other suggest that the anti-arrhythmic effects of Flecainide rely entirely on its sodium channel blocking effects.[26]\nVerapamil is a calcium channel antagonist that, when combined with a beta blocker, may reduce the risk of arrhythmias in patients with CPVT.[27] Propafenone is another antiarrhythmic that may reduce the risk of arrhythmias, potentially through direct effects on the ryanodine receptor.[26]\nSome persons with CPVT continue to experience life-threatening arrhythmias despite pharmaceutical therapy. In this case a surgical procedure can be used to affect nerves supplying the heart that communicate using catecholamines.[2] A collection of nerves known as the sympathetic nervous system supply the heart as well as other organs. These nerves, when activated, encourage the heart to beat harder and faster.[28] The sympathetic nervous system uses noradrenaline, a catecholamine, as a chemical messenger or neurotransmitter, which can promote arrhythmias in those with CPVT.[2]\nTo prevent this, a region of the sympathetic nervous system can be intentionally damaged in an operation known as cardiac sympathetic denervation or sympathectomy.[29] While the sympathetic nervous system feeds into the heart from both sides, often only the left sided nerves are targeted during sympathectomy, although destruction of the nerves on both sides may be required.[29] Through this process, sympathectomy is effective at decreasing, but not abolishing, the risk of further life-threatening arrhythmias.[4]\nWhile medication and sympathectomy aim to prevent abnormal heart rhythms from occurring in the first place, an implantable defibrillator (ICD) may be used to treat arrhythmias that medication has failed to prevent and restore a normal heart rhythm.[2] These devices, usually implanted under the skin at the front of the chest below the shoulder, can continuously monitor the heart for abnormal heart rhythms. If a life-threatening arrhythmia is detected, the device can deliver a small electric shock to terminate the abnormal rhythm and restart the heart.[1]\nImplantable defibrillators are often recommended for those with CPVT who have experienced blackouts, ventricular arrhythmias or cardiac arrest despite taking appropriate medication.[2] These devices are life-saving, as it has been shown that their use confers a significant survival benefit in patients with CPVT.[25] It has been suggested that the resulting surge of adrenaline caused by the pain of an electric shock from the device could theoretically bring on a cycle of recurrent arrhythmias and shocks known as an electrical storm,[4] and therefore it is strongly recommended that those with an ICD implanted for CPVT take a beta blocker to dampen the effects of adrenaline.[4]",
    "Prognosis": "A significant proportion of those with CPVT will experience a life-threatening abnormal heart rhythm, with estimates of this risk ranging from 13 to 20% over the course of 7–8 years.[3] Life-threatening arrhythmias are more likely to occur if CPVT has been diagnosed in childhood, if a person with CPVT does not take beta blockers, and if arrhythmias occur on exercise testing despite taking beta blockers.[2]\nDuring treatment with nadolol, the preferred beta blocker for the treatment of CPVT, event rates have been estimated to be 0.8% per year. In patients treated with beta blockers, life-threatening arrhythmias are more likely if a person had already survived a cardiac arrest, had a syncope, or are carriers of disease-causing mutations affecting the highly conserved terminal portion of RYR2 gene,[25] called the C-terminal domain (amino acids 4889–4969).[30]",
    "Epidemiology": "CPVT is estimated to affect 1 in 10,000 people.[4] Symptoms from CPVT are typically first seen in the first or second decade of life,[25] and more than 60% of affected individuals experience their first episode of syncope or cardiac arrest by age 20.[1] Syncope during exercise or strong emotion should be considered a red flag,[25] as it is a characteristic of the disease. Lastly, a small number of patients may present later in life, and genetic testing in these patients frequently fails to identify a causative gene.[4]"

    "Disease": "CDKL5 deficiency disorder",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The symptoms of CDD include early infantile onset refractory epilepsy; hypotonia; developmental, intellectual, and motor disabilities, with little or no speech; and cortical visual impairment.[1] Patients usually present first with seizures within the first months of life, followed by infantile spasms which progress to epileptic seizures that are largely refractory to treatment.[2][3] Development of gross motor skills, such as sitting, standing, and walking, is severely delayed, along with restricted fine motor skills.[4] About one-third of affected individuals can ambulate with assistance,[2] but most CDD patients rely on wheelchairs. Additional features include repetitive hand movements (stereotypies), such as clapping, hand licking, and hand sucking; tooth grinding (bruxism); disrupted sleep; feeding difficulties; gastrointestinal problems including constipation and gastroesophageal reflux. Some patients show irregular breathing.[4]",
    "Causes": "CDD is caused by pathogenic variants in the gene CDKL5. This gene provides instructions for making a protein (cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5) that is essential for normal brain development and function.[4] The CDKL5 protein is widely expressed in the brain, predominantly in nerve cells (neurons), with roles in cell proliferation, neuronal migration, axonal outgrowth, dendritic morphogenesis, and synapse development.[1] Inheritance Pattern: the CDKL5 gene is located on the X chromosome but nearly all known pathogenic mutations are de novo, rather than being inherited from an affected mother or father; the profound neurodevelopmental disabilities of CDD patients makes it extremely unlikely they would have children. There is one reported case of an inherited CDKL5 mutation; a mother carried a CDKL5 mutation on one X chromosome, but was high functioning and showed only mild cognitive impairment. The mother's mutant CDKL5 allele was skewed in its X-inactivation, being expressed in only 20% of circulating lymphoblasts. However, her daughter, who was diagnosed with CDD, expressed the mutant in 50% of her circulating lymphoblasts.[5]\nFemales: a mutation in one of the two copies of the CDKL5 gene in each cell causes the disorder. Males: a mutation in the only copy of the gene causes the disorder.[6]",
    "Diagnosis": "For the clinical diagnosis of CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder, minimal diagnostic criteria have been established, including motor and cognitive delays, epilepsy with onset within the first year of life, and the presence of a pathogenic or likely-pathogenic mutation of the CDKL5 gene.[7] While initial diagnosis is based mostly on clinical suspicion, definitive diagnosis requires confirmation by genetic testing. The first presentation of epileptic seizures within the first few months of life would suggest a possible diagnosis of CDD. Initial clinical testing for differential diagnosis may include MRI and CSF testing for structural or infectious etiologies; however, CDKL5 is now widely included in DNA sequence-based molecular diagnostic gene panels or infantile epilepsy for more rapid and precise diagnosis. Note: many adolescents and young adults may have CDD but were never tested since such tests were not available when they were infants. Therefore, epilepsy panels for CDD and other genes should be considered in such individuals.[8]\nA diagnostic ICD-10 code has been assigned to CDKL5 deficiency disorder: G40.42 (since 2020).[9]",
    "Treatment": "Antiseizure medications (ASMs) are used to manage seizures; however, in most cases, control is partial or transient.[10] Commonly used ASMs include valproic acid, clobazam, vigabatrin, felbamate, steroids, and lamotrigine for seizures,[11] although comprehensive data are limited for the efficacy and safety of ASMs in CDD; medications for infantile spasms include ACTH, prednisolone, and vigabatrin. Clinical trials support the efficacy some new ASMs.[12]\nIn March 2022, ganaxolone (Ztalmy) became the first therapeutic approved for the treatment of CDD symptoms. This drug, a GABA(A) receptor positive modulator, was approved by the US FDA in March 2022 for the treatment of seizures associated with CDD.[13]\nApproval from the EMA for the use of ganaxolone for the treatment of seizures associated with CDD was granted in July 2023.[14]\nCurrently, several other therapeutics are in phase 2 and phase 3 clinical studies for the treatment of CDD symptoms.\nMedications to control GI and sleep disturbances are often prescribed. Therapies, including physical, occupational, and vision therapy, are recommended. Specialized diets, such as the ketogenic diet, have been reported to help manage seizures, though the effect is often partial and transitory.[15]",
    "Prognosis": "The long-term prognosis for patients with CDD is not fully known, as the disorder was identified in 2013.[16] Clinical research on the natural history of CDD is required. The average life expectancy for CDD patients remains unknown.[17]",
    "Epidemiology": "The incidence rate of CDD is ~1 in 42,000 live births[18][19] This is based on both the calculated incidence rate for CDKL5 pathogenic mutations in a study population,[20] as well as comparison studies in genetic testing cohorts, in which the frequency of CDKL5 mutations is compared to that of genes whose associated disorders have more robust incidence estimates, such as SCN1A for Dravet syndrome.[21][22]"

    "Disease": "Cerebroretinal microangiopathy with calcifications and cysts",
    "Signs and symptoms": "A child who has inherited this disorder will grow slower than normal in the uterus before birth and typically will be born before term.[1][2][3] The pregnancy can be complicated by gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia.[citation needed]\nThe majority of affected children present with symptoms and signs relating to the eyes such as leukokoria, redness, irritation and impaired vision, which result from retinal detachment and glaucoma.[1][2][3] A minority present with seizures or spasticity. The time of onset of symptoms varies from infancy to adolescence. Because a child born before term will need to undergo screening for retinopathy of prematurity, some will have abnormalities in their retinal blood vessels detected when they have no symptoms yet.[citation needed]\nNeurologic symptoms and signs vary depending on the site of the brain abnormalities. Common symptoms are partial epilepsy, asymmetric spasticity, ataxia and cognitive impairment.[1][2][3] The latter affects visuospatial and visuoconstructive skills first. The intracranial pressure can be elevated if cysts develop in the brain. Migraine-like headaches can occur.[citation needed]\nSmaller blood vessels of the retina are abnormally developed and appear tortuous and dilated to a variable extent, typically in one sector and mainly in the peripheral and temporal portions of the retina.[1][2][3][9] This is known as telangiectasia. The vessel walls are weak and leak blood plasma and lipid within and underneath the retina. This leakage can lead to exudative retinal detachment, also known as exudative retinopathy in this context. The detachment typically has a yellowish tint because the fluid under the retina contains lipid. These findings mimic Coats disease.[9] Characteristically, the abnormal vessels are localized and the retinal blood vessels peripheral to the abnormal ones seemingly have failed to develop and are thus not seen.\nIn some eyes, retinal vessels form small nodules on the surface of the retina, known as angiomas.[1] These can bleed and be attached to the vitreous humour. The attachment can cause traction retinal detachment.\nRecurrent intestinal bleeding is fairly common.[1][2][6] It originates from telangiectatic small blood vessels in the intestinal mucosa. Additional findings in some individuals are portal hypertension and liver failure.[1][2]\nMany affected children develop anemia, which may be macrocytic in type.[1][2][4] Some also develop thrombocytopenia. Bone marrow examinations may show megaloblasts and increased erythropoiesis or bone marrow suppression.[1][2][4]\nThe long bones show osteopenia and pathologic fractures can occur.[1][2][4][5]\nSome children have sparse and greying hair, café au lait spots and nail dystrophy.[1][2][9]\nMost patients continue to grow poorly after birth.[1][3]",
    "Diagnosis": "The retinal changes are easily identified by ophthalmoscopy, which is performed under general anesthesia if the child is very young. The abnormal vessels are even better seen with fluorescein angiography. In advanced disease, glaucoma is diagnosed by measuring intraocular pressure and cataract by using slit lamp biomicroscopy.[citation needed]\nThe most consistent finding are widespread calcifications, which involve\nthe white matter of the cerebrum mostly adjacent to the junction with the grey matter, the thalami, the basal ganglia and the brainstem.[1][2] The white matter of the cerebellum and the dentate nuclei are less often involved. However, the brain may appear normal in the neonatal period. The calcifications are visible both with computed tomography and with magnetic resonance imaging.\nMagnetic resonance imaging shows additionally diffuse or patchy white matter changes, especially in the periventricular region, the thalami and the internal capsule. Cerebellar and brainstem lesions are less common. Imaging also uncovers parenchymal cysts situated mainly in the thalamic region and more rarely in the brainstem, the parietal lobe and the frontal lobe.\nThe long bones may be osteopenic and various skeletal changes are found in several patients, such as metaphyseal sclerosis and mild flaring, which is most pronounced in the femur and  tibia.[3][4][5]\nThe cerebrospinal fluid and blood tests are typically normal, except for anemia and thrombocytopenia in some children.[1][2][4]",
    "Treatment": "Seizures are managed with anticonvulsive medications.\nLaser coagulation or cryoablation (freezing) of the retina can be used to destroy the abnormal blood vessels. Retinal detachment is repaired with a scleral buckle or with vitrectomy. Removal or enucleation of the eye is a last resort option if the eye already has become blind and painful.[citation needed]\nRepeated blood transfusions may be needed to control anemia, and thrombocytopenia can be managed with splenectomy.[1]",
    "Prognosis": "The neurological symptoms are progressive and can lead to severe spasticity, bulbar symptoms and dysarthria within one to two decades.[1][3] The life span is shorter than normal. Death occurs between 2 and 30 years of age, depending on the severity of the syndrome. The immediate cause of death is pneumonia, fulminant intestinal bleeding or multiple organ dysfunction.[1]\nIf not treated, the retinal detachment can lead to ischemia and growth of new blood vessels over the iris and anterior chamber angle. This in turn can cause secondary glaucoma, cataract and, ultimately, blindness of the eye.[1][2]",
    "Epidemiology": "This syndrome is usually sporadic although families with two or more affected siblings of both sexes are known.[1][3]"

    "Disease": "Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis manifests in a variety of ways, including several organs and a wide spectrum of neurological and non-neurological symptoms.[3] For CTX patients, the average age of symptom onset is 19 years.[4]\nIn patients with CTX, central nervous system symptoms and signs are frequently present and can serve as the first indications. Parkinsonism and epilepsy are the first neurological conditions associated with CTX.[5][6] A wide range of neurological characteristics associated with CTX have been documented in the literature; these characteristics include dystonia, progressive ataxia, palatal myoclonus, intellectual disability, dementia, and psychiatric symptoms (such as behavioral changes, depression, agitation, hallucinations, and suicidal thoughts).[2]\nOne common indicator of CTX is cataract which develops in childhood.[7] It has been highlighted that this is an early symptom that comes before neurological symptoms and tendon xanthoma, and it is thought to be helpful for an early diagnosis.[2] Adults with CTX frequently have cataracts and optic disk paleness as well.[8] Other ocular problems associated with CTX include deposits that resemble cholesterol and retinal vessel sclerosis.[9]\nAmong the many clinical symptoms of CTX that have been documented are cardiovascular disease and premature atherosclerosis.[10] Despite having normal serum cholesterol levels, patients with CTX experienced significant premature atherosclerosis.[11] Patients with CTX have a heightened risk of developing cardiovascular disease due to their significantly elevated levels of 27-hydroxycholesterol and decreased levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in their blood lipid analysis.[12]\nPatients with CTX frequently have osteoporosis and recurrent bone fractures as clinical symptoms. Patients with significant gait abnormalities who have little bone mass are more likely to fall and break their bones accidentally.[2] In CTX patients, serum calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D metabolites are normal, but intestine radiocalcium absorption is reduced and total body bone mineral density is poor.[13]\nChronic and intractable diarrhea is a common symptom of CTX.[14] Gallstones, cholecystic polypus, and newborn cholestatic jaundice are also observed in certain CTX patients.[15][8]\nIn individuals with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, xanthomas frequently develop in the second or third decade of life, while they can occasionally not develop. They usually originate on the Achilles tendons, although they have also been discovered in the lungs, bones, and central nervous system, as well as on the extensor tendons of the elbow, hand, patellar tendon, and neck.[8]",
    "Causes": "CTX is associated with mutations in the CYP27A1 gene, located on chromosome 2q33-qter.[16] The disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.[17]",
    "Diagnosis": "Molecular genetic analysis, neuroimaging, biochemical testing, and clinical findings are the main methods used in the diagnosis of CTX. When individuals present with neurological symptoms beginning in childhood with xanthomas, a CTX diagnosis should be taken into consideration.[2]\nEnhanced plasma cholestanol and elevated bile alcohol levels in urine, along with a decreased biliary concentration of chenodeoxycholic acid, are among the biochemical anomalies observed in CTX patients.[19] Another characteristic of CTX is an increased plasma level of cholestanol.[20]",
    "Treatment": "Surgery, replacement therapy, and additional symptomatic treatment are all part of the management of CTX.[2] Bile acids such as taurocholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), cholic acid, and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are administered as part of replacement treatment.[21][22] The preferred treatment for both neurological and non-neurological symptoms of CTX is CDCA treatment (750 mg/d), although cholic acid is also effective for non-neurological symptoms. Liver transplantation,[8] low-density lipoprotein apheresis,[23] and vitamin E supplementation are further potential treatments that do not yet have solid clinical backing.[2] Owing to the wide range of symptoms and signs associated with CTX, symptomatic treatment is crucial.[2] This includes antidepressant medicine for depression,[24] antiepileptic therapy for convulsive seizures,[5] levodopa for parkinsonism,[25] and botulinum toxin for dystonia.[26]"

    "Disease": "Cherubism",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The appearance of people with the disorder is caused by a loss of bone in the mandible which the body replaces with excessive amounts of fibrous tissue. In most cases, the condition fades as the child grows, but in rare cases the condition continues to deform the affected person's face. Cherubism also causes premature loss of the primary teeth and lack of eruption and or displacement of the permanent teeth.[1]\nCherubism is a rare autosomal dominant disease of the maxilla and mandible. Five hundred and thirteen cases were reported in the medical literature by 2021, with 57.2% being in males.[2] Cherubism is usually first diagnosed around age seven and continues through puberty and may or may not continue to advance with age.[3] Degrees of cherubism vary from mild to severe. Osteoclastic and osteoblastic remodeling contributes to the change of normal bone to fibrous tissue and cyst formation. As noted by the name, the patient's face becomes enlarged and disproportionate due to the fibrous tissue and atypical bone formation. The sponge-like bone formations lead to early tooth loss and permanent tooth eruption problems. The condition also affects the orbital area, creating an upturned eye appearance. The cause of cherubism is believed to be traced to a genetic defect resulting from a mutation of the SH3BP2 gene from chromosome 4p16.3.[4] While the condition is rare and painless, the afflicted suffer the emotional trauma of disfigurement. The effects of cherubism may also interfere with normal jaw motion and speech. Currently, removal of the tissue and bone by surgery is the only treatment available. This condition is also one of the few that unexpectedly stops and regresses.[5] Normal bone remodeling activity may resume after puberty.\nCherubism is displayed with genetic conformation and when excessive osteoclasts are found in the affected areas of the mandible and maxilla. Large cysts will be present with excessive fibrous areas inside the bone. The fibers and cysts will be found among the trabecula of the Coronoid process, the ramus of mandible, the body of mandible and the maxilla regions. The maxilla will be affected up to and including the orbits and sometimes inside the lower orbits.[6] The maxilla and zygomatic bones are depressed and eyes appear to gaze upward.[7]   The maxilla has been found to be more severely affected in most cases than the mandible bone. Some patients found with lower inner orbital growths and cysts may lose vision.",
    "Causes": "Cherubism is autosomal dominantly linked. Cherubism has also been found from the random mutation of a gene in an individual having no family history of the condition. However it is not well understood why males tend to express the disease more frequently.  Children with cherubism vary in severity in their maxilla and mandible bony lesions. The disease is expressed at a rate of 80 to 100% of all affected.  Studies of multiple generations of families with the gene found that all boys developed cherubism, but 30–50% of girls show no symptoms.[8]\nThe cause of cherubism is believed to be from a mutation of gene of SH3BP2. Cherubism has also been found combined with other genetic disorders including Noonan syndrome, Ramon syndrome, and fragile X syndrome.[9] SH3BP2 mutations were reported in 93.5% of the cases in which the gene was investigated and mainly occurred at protein residues 415, 418, 419, and 420.[2] The mutation of the SH3BP2 gene is believed to increase production of over active proteins from this gene. However, Specific amino acid substitutions of SH3BP2 mutations were not associated with the clinical grading of the disease.[2] The SH3BP2 gene is found on the smaller arm of chromosome 4 at position 16.3.[4] The SH3BP2 protein is involved with chemical signaling to immune system cells known as macrophages and B cells.[citation needed]\nThe effects of SH3BP2 mutations are still under study, but researchers believe that the abnormal protein disrupts critical signaling pathways in cells associated with the maintenance of bone tissue and in some immune system cells. The overactive protein likely causes inflammation in the jaw bones and triggers the production of osteoclasts, which are cells that break down bone tissue during bone remodeling. Osteoclasts also sense the increased inflammation of the mandible and maxilla and are further activated to break down bone structures.  Bone loss and inflammation lead to increased fibrous tissue and cyst growth. An excess of these bone-eating cells contributes to the destruction of bone in the upper and lower jaws. A combination of bone loss and inflammation likely underlies the cyst-like growths characteristic of cherubism.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "The chemical imbalance is usually diagnosed when dental abnormalities are found. These abnormalities include premature deciduous teeth and abnormal growth of permanent teeth due to displacement by cysts and lesions. The only definite way to correctly diagnose the condition is by sequence analysis of the SH3BP2 gene. The gene has been found to have missense mutation in exon 9.[5] Initial study of the patient is usually conducted using x-ray and CT scans. Neurofibromatosis may resemble cherubism and may accompany the condition. Genetic testing is the final diagnosis tool.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Because cherubism changes and improves over time, the treatment should be individually determined. Generally, moderate cases are watched until they subside or progress into the more severe range. Severe cases may require surgery to eliminate bulk cysts and fibrous growth of the maxilla and mandible. There are few reports in the medical literature in which the patients were treated with different medical drugs.[2] Surgical bone grafting of the cranial facial bones may be successful on some patients. Surgery is preferred for patients aged 5 to 15.[3] Special consideration should be taken when operating on the face to avoid the marginal mandibular branch as well as the zygomatic branch of the facial nerve. Unintentional damage to these nerves can decrease muscle strength in the face and mandible region. Orthodontic treatment is generally required to avoid permanent dental problems arising from malocclusive bite and misplaced permanent teeth that have not erupted.[3] Orthodontic treatment may be used to erupt permanent teeth that have been unable to descend due to lesions and cysts being in their path of eruption. Patients with orbital issues of diplopia, eye proptosis, and visual loss will require ophthalmologic treatment.[3]",
    "Prognosis": "Due to the rarity of the condition, it is difficult to reliably estimate statistics. However, a 2006 study which followed 7 cases over an average of 8.5 years noted that \"In general, cherubism does not have a poor prognosis. It has been noted that the condition does not progress beyond puberty. As the patient grows to adulthood, the jawbone lesions tend to resolve, and a progressively more normal jaw configuration is noted.\"[10]"

    "Disease": "Childhood dementia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "By their usual definitions, childhood dementias always cause global neurocognitive decline. In some childhood dementia conditions the child's early development is indistinguishable from their healthy peers, then slows or plateaus before declining. In other childhood dementia disorders, early development may be slower than typical before declining.[12]\nThis progressive decline causes difficulty concentrating, memory loss, confusion, and learning difficulties,[4] in addition to the loss of developmental skills acquired previously, such as: walking, talking, writing, reading, and playing.[4][13] Eventually the body loses its ability to function, leading to an early death.[12][4][13]\nOther symptoms and complications can occur depending on the subtype.[1]\nOther symptoms:\nOther complications:",
    "Causes": "The majority of childhood dementia cases are caused by genetic diseases.[1] More than 145 monogenic diseases have been identified that cause dementia with onset in childhood. Examples include lysosomal disorders such as Sanfilippo syndrome, Niemann-Pick disease type C and Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinoses (NCLs or Batten Disease), some mitochondrial diseases such as Leigh syndrome and peroxisomal disorders such as X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. Two-thirds of the cases can be attributed to inborn errors of metabolism.[1][15]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis typically involves a combination of biochemical testing and genetic testing, often performed around the age of four. Early diagnosis is crucial for managing symptoms and improving the quality of life for those affected.[1] In most cases, childhood dementia is diagnosed after developmental regression is observed.\nChildhood dementia is very often diagnosed late, misdiagnosed, or not diagnosed at all.[9] A correct diagnosis happens, on average, 2 years or more after symptoms become apparent. Additionally, children affected by childhood dementia are often misdiagnosed with:\nThese issues in diagnosis are attributed to the:",
    "Treatment": "Treatment of childhood dementia focuses on managing symptoms and improving quality of life.\nThis can include:",
    "Prognosis": "The prognosis for childhood dementia is generally poor, with most children experiencing a significant decline in cognitive and motor function.\nThe impact on life expectancy depends on the individual condition,[9] but is usually severe without treatment.[1][3] It is estimated that only 25–29% of people affected survive to adulthood, and only 10% to the age of 50.[1] The median life expectancy is around 9 years, and the average life expectancy is 16.3 years.[1]\nThe causes of death are attributed to respiratory complications in the late stage of the disease (e.g. pneumonia), neurological complications (e.g. drug resistant epilepsy), and cardiac events.[10][11]",
    "Epidemiology": "Current estimates place the incidence of childhood dementias at 1 in 1186 births.[1] This is higher than the incidence of some diseases with more widespread awareness, such as cystic fibrosis[3] (affecting around 1 in 3000-4000 births)[21] and spinal muscular atrophy (around 1 in 11000 births).[1][22]\nMeanwhile, the estimates for the prevalence are lower, at 1 in 3484 people in the general population[1] and 1 in 1715 among children.[1]",

    "Disease": "Childhood granulomatous periorificial dermatitis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "CGPD is characterized by the presence of small, raised, dome-shaped, flesh-colored or yellow-brown papules primarily distributed around the mouth, eyes, and nose.[1] Affected children may also have papules on the ears, eyelids, cheeks, forehead, and nose.[1] CGPD skin lesions rarely affect areas of the skin other than the face.[1]",
    "Causes": "The cause of CGPD is unknown.[3]",
    "Diagnosis": "The approach to diagnosing CGPD is controversial.[2] Certain dermatologists suggest that ruling out infectious and allergic causes of similar skin eruptions and a skin biopsy demonstrating features consistent with CGPD is adequate for diagnosis. In contrast, other dermatologists advocate for performing a complete history and physical examination and obtaining laboratories and appropriate imaging to rule out cutaneous sarcoidosis.[2] On microscopy, non-tuberculous granulomas with surrounding lymphocytes clustered around hair follicles may be seen; additionally, infiltrates of epithelioid macrophages, lymphocytes, and giant cells may also be seen.[2][3]\nSeveral conditions exhibit skin findings similar to those of CGPD. These conditions include perioral dermatitis, acne vulgaris, granulomatous rosacea, contact dermatitis, folliculitis, atopic dermatitis, cheilitis, medication-induced acneiform eruptions, lupus miliaris disseminatus faciei, benign cephalic histiocytosis, granulosis rubra nasi, xanthomas, zinc deficiency, glucagonoma, cutaneous sarcoidosis, and scabies.[2][3]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment recommendations for CGPD vary and may include observation without treatment, stopping the use of topical corticosteroids, and the use of topical or oral antibiotics as well as isotretinoin.[2] Topical antibiotics such as metronidazole and erythromycin have been used for CGPD.[2] Oral antibiotics of the tetracycline class such as minocycline, doxycycline, and tetracycline have been recommended for CGPD.[1] Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole has also been used.[2] The use of oral systemic antibiotics is limited by side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity of the skin to sunlight.[1] Tetracycline antibiotics are not recommended for children under the age of 8 since tetracyclines are known to deposit in teeth (thereby staining them) and impair bone growth in children.[1]\nThe use of calcineurin inhibitor creams such as tacrolimus or pimecrolimus on the skin is controversial and results have been mixed.[1] Certain studies found the use of topical calcineurin inhibitors led to resolution of CGPD whereas others saw incomplete resolution or prolonged symptoms.[1] Topical azelaic acid has been used successfully to treat CGPD.[1] Immediate discontinuation of topical corticosteroids is recommended since corticosteroids are thought to worsen CGPD.[2]",
    "Prognosis": "CGPD is known to be a temporary skin disease with a benign course.[1] The skin papules typically resolve after a few months to a few years. After CGPD resolves, the skin may return to normal without scarring or may have small atrophic depressions with collagen loss, milia, or small pit-like scars.[1]",
    "Epidemiology": "CGPD occurs most often in children of Afro-Caribbean descent  before puberty though reports of this disease occurring in Asian and Caucasian children have also been described.[1][3] Due to the limited number of reported cases, it remains controversial whether CGPD occurs more often in African children than in children of other races.[2] CGPD is more common in boys than girls.[3]"

Patients develop generalized chorea and a minority of Choreoacanthocytosis patients develops Parkinsonism.[11]\nIn a least one third of patients, seizures, typically generalized, are the first manifestation of disease. Impairment of memory and executive functions is frequent, although not invariable.[11]\nPeople afflicted by this disease also experience a loss of neurons. Loss of neurons is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases. Due to the generally non-regenerative nature of neuronal cells in the adult central nervous system, this results in an irreversible and fatal process of neurodegeneration.[10] There is also the presence of several movement related disorders including chorea, dystonia and bradykinesia, one of the more incapacitating ones includes Truncal spasms.[7]",
    "Causes": "Choreo-acanthocytosis is caused by a mutation in both copies of the gene VPS13A, which codes for vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 13A.[12]",
    "Diagnosis": "Protein function tests that demonstrate a reduce in chorein levels and also genetic analysis can confirm the diagnosis given to a patient. For a disease like this it is often necessary to sample the blood of the patient on multiple occasions with a specific request given to the haematologist to examine the film for acanthocytes.[6] Another point is that the diagnosis of the disease can be confirmed by the absence of chorein in the western blot of the erythrocyte membranes.[10]",
    "Treatment": "The treatment to battle the disease chorea-acanthocytosis is completely symptomatic. For example, botulinum toxin injections can help to control orolingual dystonia.[6]\nDeep brain stimulation is a treatment that has varied effects on the people suffering from the symptoms of this disease, for some it has helped in a large way and for other people it did not help whatsoever, it is more effective on specific symptoms of the disease.[7] Patients with chorea-acanthocytosis should undergo a cardiac evaluation every five years to look for cardiomyopathy.[citation needed]"

These symptoms appear within days of birth in the more severe forms of the disease with complete deficiency of the enzyme. As ammonia accumulates further, the affected infant may enter a hyperammonemic coma, which indicates neurological damage and can cause developmental delays, cognitive disabilities, cerebral palsy, hypertonia, spasticity, ankle clonus, seizures, and liver failure.[2]\nMilder forms of the disease are caused by partial arginosuccinate synthetase deficiency and may manifest in childhood or in adulthood. Symptoms of mild CTLN1 include failure to thrive, avoidance of high-protein foods, ataxia, worsening lethargy, and vomiting. Hyperammonemic coma can still develop in these people.[2] CTLN1 can also develop in the perinatal period.[3]",
    "Diagnosis": "As one of the urea cycle disorders, citrullinemia type I needs to be distinguished from the others: carbamoyl phosphate synthetase deficiency, \nargininosuccinic acid lyase deficiency, ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, arginase deficiency, and N-Acetylglutamate synthase deficiency. Other diseases that may appear similar to CTLN1 include the organic acidemias and citrin deficiency. To diagnose CTLN1, a blood test for citrulline and ammonia levels can indicate the correct diagnosis; high levels of both are indicative of this disorder. Newborns are routinely screened for CTLN1 at birth. A genetic test is the only definitive way to diagnose it.[2]",
    "Treatment": "The main treatments for CTLN1 include a low-protein, high-calorie diet with amino acid supplements, particularly arginine. The Ucyclyd protocol, using buphenyl and ammonul, is used for treatment as well. Hyperammonemia is treated with hemodialysis; intravenous arginine, sodium benzoate, and sodium phenylacetate.

    "Disease": "Cockayne syndrome",
    "Causes": "If hyperoxia or excess oxygen occurs in the body, the cellular metabolism produces several highly reactive forms of oxygen called free radicals. This can cause oxidative damage to cellular components including the DNA. In normal cells, our body repairs the damaged sections. In the case of this disease, due to subtle defects in transcription, children's genetic machinery for synthesizing proteins needed by the body does not operate at normal capacity. Over time, went this theory, results in developmental failure and death. Every minute, the body pumps 10 to 20 liters of oxygen through the blood, carrying it to billions of cells in our bodies. In its normal molecular form, oxygen is harmless. However, cellular metabolism involving oxygen can generate several highly reactive free radicals. These free radicals can cause oxidative damage to cellular components including the DNA. In an average human cell, several thousand lesions occur in the DNA every day. Many of these lesions result from oxidative damage. Each lesion—a damaged section of DNA—must be snipped out and the DNA repaired to preserve its normal function. Unrepaired DNA can lose its ability to code for proteins. Mutations also can result. These mutations can activate oncogenes or silence tumor suppressor genes. According to research, oxidative damage to active genes is not preferentially repaired, and in the most severe cases, the repair is slowed throughout the whole genome. The resulting accumulation of oxidative damage could impair the normal functions of the DNA and may even result in triggering a program of cell death (apoptosis). The children with this disease do not repair the active genes where oxidative damage occurs. Normally, oxidative damage repair is faster in the active genes (which make up less than five percent of the genome) than in inactive regions of the DNA. The resulting accumulation of oxidative damage could impair the normal functions of the DNA and may even result in triggering a program of cell death (apoptosis).[12]",
    "Diagnosis": "People with this syndrome have smaller than normal head sizes (microcephaly), are of short stature (dwarfism), their eyes appear sunken, and they have an \"aged\" look. They often have long limbs with joint contractures (inability to relax the muscle at a joint), a hunched back (kyphosis), and they may be very thin (cachetic), due to a loss of subcutaneous fat. Their small chin, large ears, and pointy, thin nose often give an aged appearance.[9]\nThe skin of those with Cockayne syndrome is also frequently affected: hyperpigmentation, varicose or spider veins (telangiectasia),[9] and serious sensitivity to sunlight are common, even in individuals without XP-CS. Often patients with Cockayne Syndrome will severely burn or blister with very little heat exposure.\nThe eyes of patients can be affected in various ways and eye abnormalities are common in CS. Cataracts and cloudiness of the cornea (corneal opacity) are common. The loss of and damage to the nerves of the optic nerve, causing optic atrophy, can occur.[3] Nystagmus, or involuntary eye movement, and pupils that fail to dilate demonstrate a loss of control of voluntary and involuntary muscle movement.[9] A salt and pepper retinal pigmentation is also a typical sign.\nDiagnosis is determined by a specific test for DNA repair, which measures the recovery of RNA after exposure to UV radiation. Despite being associated with genes involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER), unlike xeroderma pigmentosum, CS is not associated with an increased risk of cancer.[6]\nIn Cockayne syndrome patients, UV-irradiated cells show decreased DNA and RNA synthesis.[20] Laboratory studies are mainly useful to eliminate other disorders. For example, skeletal radiography, endocrinologic tests, and chromosomal breakage studies can help in excluding disorders included in the differential diagnosis.[citation needed]\nBrain CT scanning in Cockayne syndrome patients may reveal calcifications and cortical atrophy.[15]\nPrenatal evaluation is possible. Amniotic fluid cell culturing is used to demonstrate that fetal cells are deficient in RNA synthesis after UV irradiation.[citation needed]\nImaging studies reveal a widespread absence of the myelin sheaths of the neurons in the white matter of the brain and general atrophy of the cortex.[6] Calcifications have also been found in the putamen, an area of the forebrain that regulates movements and aids in some forms of learning,[9] along with the cortex.[7] Additionally, atrophy of the central area of the cerebellum found in patients with Cockayne syndrome could also result in the lack of muscle control, particularly involuntary, and poor posture typically seen.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "There is no cure for this syndrome, although patients can be symptomatically treated. Treatment usually involves physical therapy and minor surgeries to the affected organs, such as cataract removal.[3] Also wearing high-factor sunscreen and protective clothing is recommended because Cockayne Syndrome patients are very sensitive to UV radiation.[21] Optimal nutrition can also help. Genetic counseling for the parents is recommended, as the disorder has a 25% chance of being passed to any future children, and prenatal testing is also a possibility.[3] Another important aspect is the prevention of recurrence of CS in other siblings. Identification of gene defects involved makes it possible to offer genetic counseling and antenatal\ndiagnostic testing to the parents who already have one affected child.[22]\nCurrently, there are two ongoing projects focused on the development of gene therapy for Cockayne syndrome. The first project, led by the Viljem Julijan Association for Children with Rare Diseases, aims to develop gene therapy specifically for Cockayne syndrome type B.[23] The second project, led by the Riaan Research Initiative, is dedicated to the development of gene therapy for Cockayne syndrome type A.[24]",
    "Prognosis": "The prognosis for those with Cockayne syndrome is poor, as death typically occurs by the age of 12.[25]\nThe prognosis for Cockayne syndrome varies by disease type. There are three types of Cockayne syndrome according to the severity and onset of the symptoms. However, the differences between the types are not always clear-cut, and some researchers believe the signs and symptoms reflect a spectrum instead of distinct types:\nCockayne syndrome Type A (CSA) is marked by normal development until a child is 1 or 2 years old, at which point growth slows and developmental delays are noticed. Symptoms are not apparent until they are 1 year. Life expectancy for type A is approximately 10 to 20 years. These symptoms are seen in CS type 1 children.\nCockayne syndrome type B (CSB), also known as \"cerebro-oculo-facio-skeletal (COFS) syndrome\" (or \"Pena-Shokeir syndrome type B\"), is the most severe subtype. Symptoms are present at birth and normal brain development stops after birth. The average lifespan for children with type B is up to 7 years of age. These symptoms are seen in CS type 2 children.\nCockayne syndrome type C (CSC) appears later in childhood with milder symptoms than the other types and a slower progression of the disorder. People with this type of Cockayne syndrome live into adulthood, with an average lifespan of 40 to 50 years. These symptoms are seen in CS type 3.[15]",
    "Epidemiology": "Cockayne syndrome is rare worldwide. No racial predilection is reported for Cockayne syndrome. No sexual predilection is described for Cockayne syndrome; the male-to-female ratio is equal. Cockayne syndrome I (CS-A) manifests in childhood. Cockayne syndrome II (CS-B) manifests at birth or in infancy, and it has a worse prognosis.[15]"

    "Disease": "Combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The clinical phenotypes of CMAMMA are highly heterogeneous and range from asymptomatic, mild to severe symptoms.[7][8] The underlying pathophysiology is not yet understood.[5] In the literature[note 2], the following symptoms have been reported:[3][4][2][9][7][10]\nWhen the first symptoms appear in childhood, they are more likely to be intermediary metabolic disorders, whereas in adults they are usually neurological symptoms.[2]",
    "Causes": "CMAMMA is an inborn, autosomal-recessive metabolic disorder caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in the ACSF3 gene.[2] This results in a defect of the mitochondrial enzyme acyl-CoA synthetase family member 3 (ACSF3), leading to reduced or complete loss of its activity.[2] The ACSF3 gene, located on chromosome 16 at locus q24.3, consists of 14 exons and produces four alternatively spliced mRNAs that encode two isoforms of the ACSF3 protein:\nBased on minor allele frequency (MAF), a prevalence of ~ 1: 30 000 can be predicted for CMAMMA.[2]",
    "Diagnosis": "CMAMMA is thought to be an under-recognized disorder, as it escapes detection by newborn screening programs and presents with a wide range of clinical symptoms.[3][4] In many case reports, severe or recurrent infections were the trigger for seeking medical attention, which, after further investigations, led to the diagnosis of CMAMMA.[3][7][10][11]\nNewborn screenings detect possible methylmalonic acidemias in first-tier testing by elevated propionylcarnitine (C3) and abnormal ratios such as propionylcarnitine to acetylcarnitine (C3/C2) or C3/methionine in dried blood spots.[43][44][45] However, methylmalonic acid is measured only in later-tier testing after abnormal first-tier markers, and CMAMMA is not detected by this approach because propionylcarnitine remains normal.[43][44][45][3]\nBiochemically, CMAMMA is characterized by methylmalonic acid levels exceeding those of malonic acid and for differential diagnosis, it can be rapidly distinguished from classic methylmalonic acidemias by the blood plasma methylmalonic acid to malonic acid ratio.[3]\nThe following table summarizes reported blood and urine values[note 3] of methylmalonic acid, malonic acid, and their ratio in CMAMMA patients:\nIn CMAMMA, the acylcarnitine profile is normal, including propionylcarnitine (C3), as malonyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, and methylmalonyl-CoA do not accumulate, and homocysteine, vitamin B12, and ammonia are also within the normal range in the absence of other disorders.[4][8]\nGenomic techniques represent a key diagnostic tool for CMAMMA, especially when early biochemical detection has been missed.[2] The final diagnosis is defined by biallelic pathogenic variants in the ACSF3 gene, which can be identified on the one hand, through targeted testing usually prompted by elevated methylmalonic acid levels and detected using specific multigene panels for methylmalonic acidemias.[46][48] On the other hand, CMAMMA may be discovered incidentally during broader genetic investigations for unexplained clinical features.\nExpanded carrier screening (ECS) in the context of fertility treatment can detect heterozygous ACSF3 variants, which are asymptomatic in carriers but indicate a reproductive risk when both partners are carriers.[49]",
    "Treatment": "Currently, no treatment has been conclusively shown to be effective in managing CMAMMA.[10] The following treatment options are under discussion:\nDiet interventions have been proposed to reduce the accumulation of malonic acid and methylmalonic acid, although results have been conflicting.[47][8] While a 1998 case report, describing a CMAMMA patient with normal malonyl-CoA decarboxylase activity but without genetic testing for ACSF3, recommended a high-carbohydrate, low-protein diet, a later study reported no influence of protein restriction on methylmalonic acid levels.[47][8]\nSince some methylmalonic acidemias respond to vitamin B12, treatment attempts in CMAMMA with vitamin B12 have been made, also in the form of hydroxocobalamin injections, which, however did not lead to any clinical or biochemical effects.[4]\nL-Carnitine facilitates the excretion of acyl-CoA esters by converting them into acylcarnitines via carnitine acyltransferases, but in CMAMMA such CoA esters do not accumulate as in isolated methylmalonic acidemias, and carnitine acyltransferases cannot utilize malonic or methylmalonic acid as substrates.[50][39] One study mentions treatment with L-carnitine in patients with CMAMMA, but only retrospectively and without mentioning results.[4]\nPreclinical proof of concept studies in animal models have shown that mRNA therapy is also suitable for use in rare metabolic diseases.[51] In this context, Moderna's therapy candidate mRNA-3705 for mut-type methylmalonic acidemia, currently in phase 1/2, is notable.[52] While it is not targeted at CMAMMA, it illustrates the potential of such approaches for similar metabolic disorders."

    "Disease": "Congenital hyperinsulinism",
    "Signs and symptoms": "As HI is a congenital condition, an infant usually starts to show signs and symptoms within the first few days of life, although very occasionally symptoms may appear later in life. It is often difficult to identify signs and symptoms of HI because they are often confused with the typical behaviours of newborns and infants.[18] About 60% of babies with HI develop hypoglycemia during the first month of life. An additional 30% will be diagnosed later in the first year and some later in life.[5]\nHI may present in several ways; common symptoms of hypoglycemia include:\nOlder children and adults' symptoms may also include headaches, confusion, and dizziness.[23]\nParents often describe initial concerns or symptoms such as their infants \"not feeding well, being sleepy and jittery\".[5]\nMore severe symptoms, such as seizures (fits or convulsions), can occur with a prolonged or extremely low blood sugar level.[24][22][19][20] If the blood sugar level is not corrected, it can lead to loss of consciousness and potential brain injury.[24]\nA simple blood sugar measurement is essential if there are any symptoms of hypoglycaemia.[25]",
    "Causes": "Hyperinsulinism or congenital hyperinsulinism can be a genetic or acquired condition. Acquired HI may be secondary to factors around birth, such as growth restriction of the fetus, less oxygen to the baby, or maternal diabetes. Together, these are often called perinatal stress-induced HI. They are typically present in the first 24 hours of life but often resolve by two weeks of age.[17][26]\nIn contrast to the resolving perinatal stress-induced low blood sugars, HI can also be due to a genetic cause. Therefore, genetic testing should be considered in children in whom acquired HI is unlikely. This typically includes those not responding to first-line medication diazoxide. A genetic cause is also possible in children responding to diazoxide but where low sugars persist beyond the first 4 months of life.[6][27]\nThere are many different genetic forms of HI which can be present in isolation or as part of a wider condition, called a syndrome.[28]\nIsolated hyperinsulinism occurs in the majority of individuals with HI. The most common genetic cause is a change in one or both copies of a gene that instructs the building of the potassium channel (ABCC8 and KCNJ11).[29][30] This channel normally regulates insulin production from the β-cell in the pancreas in response to sugar levels in the blood. A change or fault in the channel leads to uncontrolled and excessive production of insulin. These changes in the ABCC8/KCNJ11 genes can be inherited in a dominant or recessive manner. In the dominant form, a single (monoallelic) change inherited from one parent (or arising spontaneously) causes diffuse HI. In diffuse HI, the whole pancreas is affected. Dominant HI may be mild and respond to diazoxide or severe and diazoxide unresponsive. Some changes in the ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes are not inherited dominantly but are inherited recessively. In these families, each parent carries one copy of a faulty gene, but are themselves unaffected. A child will develop HI if they inherit two copies of the faulty ABCC8/KCNJ11 gene, one from each parent. Recessively inherited changes in the ABCC8/KCNJ11 genes cause diffuse HI which typically does not respond to diazoxide. In some cases, a paternal copy of the faulty gene is inherited by the child which occurs in combination with a loss of the mother's normal copy of the gene in the pancreas. This gives rise to focal HI where only one part of the pancreas (called a focal lesion) produces excess insulin.[6][31][7]\nIf HI is severe and not responsive to medicines, rapid testing of the ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes is recommended. This helps to identify the possibility of focal HI early in the course of the illness. Following a genetic finding, specialised positron emission tomography (PET) scanning using the radiotracer 18-fluoro-dopa can be used to localise the focal abnormality (lesion) for surgical removal. Genetic testing is also helpful to determine if two copies of faulty ABCC8/KCNJ11 genes are inherited – these indicate a diagnosis of diffuse HI that may not respond to diazoxide. Such cases require treatment with alternative medications such as octreotide and may need surgical removal of most of the pancreas. Therefore, early rapid genetic testing is important to guide the medical and surgical management of children with severe HI. Results from HI genetic testing are preferably analysed by molecular genetics laboratories experienced and specialised in HI.[32][28][7][27]\nAnother common genetic cause of HI results from changes in the gene for the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). This genetic form of HI is also known as GDH-CHI or GLUD1-CHI. These gene changes are inherited dominantly but may also arise spontaneously. In this condition, ammonia levels in the blood are mildly raised. Children and adults with GDH-CHI often respond to diazoxide. An excess of proteins in the diet can bring about low sugars, so a good carbohydrate-to-protein ratio is advisable. There are many other genetic causes of isolated HI. Examples include changes in the genes that make the enzymes hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase gene (SCHAD-CHI) and glucokinase (GCK-CHI). More recently, changes in hexokinase 1 (HK1), another enzyme similar to glucokinase have been identified to cause both mild and severe forms of illness.[27][7][33]\nSyndromic HI is less common than isolated HI. Data from patient registries suggest a prevalence of less than 1% among reported cases.[34] In syndromic HI, genetic causes are common.[35] Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), an overgrowth syndrome is a well-recognized form of syndromic HI. Other syndromes that commonly feature HI include Kabuki syndrome and Turner syndrome. Most individuals with syndromic HI respond to treatment with diazoxide and HI may resolve over time. However, HI with BWS can be severe and be unresponsive to usual therapy.[36][37][38]",
    "Diagnosis": "HI is due to dysregulation of the secretion of the hormone insulin from beta-cells in the pancreas. Insulin is present in the blood at the time of hypoglycemia rather than being suppressed. This can be difficult to measure due to fluctuation in insulin levels. The diagnosis of HI is made based on increased insulin action and/or inadequate suppression of plasma insulin during a time of hypoglycemia. Increased insulin action can be demonstrated by increased glucose requirement (e.g., > 8 mg/kg/minute in a newborn compared to normal of 4-6 mg/kg/minute.[39] Another sign of excess insulin action is suppressed blood levels of free fatty acids and ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate) during hypoglycemia. The clinical diagnosis is also supported by a large blood glucose rise after glucagon administration at the time of hypoglycemia.[40][41][42] Glucagon is another hormone secreted from the pancreas that opposes insulin action and stimulates the release of glucose from liver glycogen stores. Measurement of insulin, c-peptide (which is co-secreted with insulin) free fatty acids and ketones together with a glucagon stimulation test can be performed during the spontaneous time of hypoglycemia or during hypoglycemia induced by a period of supervised and monitored fasting. In newborn infants, there is a time of transitional hypoglycaemia due to hyperinsulinism for the first after birth 72 hours. Hence the clinical diagnosis is best established after 72 hours of age.[28] Assessing blood ammonia and acylcarnitine profile, urinary metabolic profiles, in addition to provocative responses to protein and amino acids (leucine) may be helpful in defining the subtype of HI.[43][44][45][46]",
    "Treatment": "The goal of treatment in hyperinsulinism is to prevent hypoglycemia-induced brain damage, thus, the goal of therapy is to maintain the blood sugar level in the normal range [>70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L)]. The first step is the restoration of blood sugar level to the normal range after acute hypoglycemia, followed by the prevention of recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia, which is common in congenital hyperinsulinism. This is best accomplished with intravenous dextrose initially.\nOnce the diagnosis of HI has been established, including determination of the genotype and phenotype, whenever possible, specific treatment should be initiated. Some of the following measures are often tried:\nDiazoxide, a KATP channel opener, that inhibits insulin secretion by binding to the sulfonylurea 1 (SUR1) component of the KATP channel, is the only drug with regulatory approval for the treatment of HI and the first-line of therapy for this condition.[48] To prevent complications from diazoxide-induced fluid retention, diuretic therapy is typically initiated concomitantly with diazoxide. Dose selection and dose escalation should be carefully considered weighing the response and potential for side effects. Because of its long half-life, it may take up to 5 days to achieve a full therapeutic effect. An important next step is the assessment of the responsiveness to diazoxide, which has important diagnostic and therapeutic implications. Responsiveness to diazoxide is defined by the demonstration that the cardinal feature of HI, hypoketotic hypoglycemia, is corrected by treatment. This is best assessed by a fasting test demonstrating that the child can fast for 12-18 hours with plasma glucose ≥ 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) or that plasma betahydroxybutyrate increases to > 1.8 mmol/L before plasma glucose decreases below 50-60 mg/dL (2.8-3.3 mmol/L) during fasting. Lack of responsiveness to diazoxide suggests the possibility that the HI is due to inactivating mutation(s) in the genes encoding the KATP channels which accounts for up to 90% of cases of diazoxide-unresponsive HI. For these cases, rapid genetic testing of the genes ABCC8 and KCNJ11 is critical to determine the likelihood of focal HI.[30]\nSurgery is the treatment of choice for focal HI, but before surgery, it is important to localize the lesion. These lesions are not visible using conventional imaging techniques such as ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scan, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) However, specialized imaging using 18-F-L 3,4 dihydroxyphenylalanine (18F DOPA) positron emission tomography (PET) scan is almost 100% accurate in localizing a focal lesion.[49] Expert assessment of the pancreatic histology during surgery using frozen biopsies and surgical expertise are key for the success of the surgery. The reported cure rate for focal HI is 97%.[12]\nFor non-focal diazoxide-unresponsive cases, treatment options are limited. Off-label use of the somatostatin analogue octreotide has been the long-standing second line of treatment for HI,[50] but its effectiveness is limited by the development of tachyphylaxis. It is important to note that in countries where diazoxide is not available, octreotide may be the first line of therapy. Because of its association with potentially fatal necrotizing enterocolitis, octreotide use in very young infants should be carefully considered weighting the risk versus the potential benefits.[51] Octreotide is administrated as a subcutaneous injection typically every 6 hours but it can also be administrated continuously through a subcutaneous pump. Long-acting somatostatin analogues, octreotide LAR (administrated intramuscularly) and lanreotide (administered as a deep subcutaneous injection), are convenient options for older children. An alternative treatment approach for diazoxide-unresponsive cases that are either not eligible or unresponsive to somatostatin analogues is the use of a continuous infusion of dextrose through a gastrostomy tube.[52]",
    "Prognosis": "The outcomes of individuals with HI are affected by the disease process itself, including the consequences of delayed diagnosis, the side effects of therapy, and the effectiveness of treatment.\nSide effects of therapy are common in children treated with diazoxide and somatostatin analogues, affecting up to 50% of treated patients with various degrees of severity.[53][54][55][56][50] Surgical outcomes are excellent for children with the focal form of HI with a cure rate of 97%.[12] However, up to 50% of children with the diffuse form of the disease that undergo a near-total pancreatectomy continue to have hypoglycemia after surgery requiring additional therapy.[12][10] Over time, these children developed insulin-dependent diabetes and pancreatic insufficiency. Ninety-one percent of children who had undergone a near-total pancreatectomy require insulin by age 14 years.[57]\nThe frequency of neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioral problems in children with hyperinsulinism is as high as 40-50% across different patient types  and countries.[11][10][58][59] Therefore neurodevelopmental assessments should be performed throughout childhood, even in those children who have outgrown or have undergone surgical cure of the disease.",
    "Epidemiology": "The incidence of HI is variable. It ranges from 1:2500 in people where cousin marriages are common to 1:50,000 in other people. These numbers may be inaccurate as they are based on small numbers of children with HI admitted to hospitals.[8] The incidence of persistent forms of HI has been reported in the UK to be 1:28,389.[60] In Finland, the incidence has been reported to be 1:13,500.[61] The incidence of transient forms of HI has been reported at 1:7400. However, perinatal stress induced hyperinsulinism is relatively common and so the figure is predicted to be higher.[61][7] The true incidence of HI will not be known until newborn screening services are developed for HI.\nThe natural history of HI varies with the severity of illness and whether or not HI is transient. Children with severe HI are often unresponsive to medical treatment and may require pancreatic surgery.[32] Although surgery is more likely in those with genetic forms of HI, there appears to be a reduction in severity over time, encouraging some clinicians to maintain normal glucose levels by a combination of medications such as octreotide and carbohydrate-rich feeds.[12][62] Similarly, some children with changes in genes making up the potassium channel (ABCC8/KCNJ11) showed a reduction in severity.[63]\nChanges in a single copy of the ABCC8/KCNJ11 genes can be inherited by dominant transmission, i.e., transmission from an affected parent to the child. In such children, remission can happen, although variably.[64][65] In this group, some children and adults may also develop high blood sugar and diabetes in later life.[66] Similarly, a change from low to high blood sugar can also be seen in those with changes in HNF1A and HNF4A genes.[67][68]\nThe natural history of HI goes beyond the problem of hypoglycemia. An important consequence of early-life hypoglycemia is brain injury. Delays in childhood development have been reported in up to 50%, particularly in those with severe HI.[10][11] Feeding problems are also reported commonly by parents.[5][34] Feeding problems appear to be more frequent in children with severe HI and may continue over long periods.[69][70]\nThe natural history of HI includes the onset and progress of treatment-related side effects. In the short term, diazoxide may cause life-threatening pulmonary hypertension but this happens only in a minority of cases.[71] More commonly, many on diazoxide develop excess body hair or a change in facial features over a long time.[6][34][55] Children with focal forms of HI treated by limited surgery to the pancreas are usually cured and have no residual pancreas problems. By contrast, those having more extensive surgery, for example, subtotal pancreatectomy, invariably develop diabetes requiring insulin by late childhood or adolescence.[57] In the period after pancreatic surgery, they often have a combination of low and high sugars before frank diabetes. About half of such individuals develop the need for pancreatic enzyme supplements.[72]",
    "Society and culture": "Patient advocacy organizations dedicated to improving the lives of people born with congenital hyperinsulinism play an important role in supporting people with the disease and their families, participating in and funding research on HI, and raising awareness of the condition.[78][79] For example Congenital Hyperinsulinism International is a globally focused patient advocacy organization dedicated to improving the lives of people born with congenital hyperinsulinism. They are a member of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative's Rare as One Network, which is a group of patient-led organizations that have launched collaborative research networks.[34]\nCountry-specific patient advocacy organizations include:\nPeople with congenital hyperinsulinism can participate in a patient reported registry called the HI Global Registry. By submitting a survey on their experiences to the registry, people with HI can help research the condition.[34][89]\nSince 2021, centers that provide the highest quality of care for people with congenital hyperinsulinism (HI) have been designated as Centers of Excellence (COE) by the Congenital Hyperinsulinism International (CHI). Being a COE also involves a commitment to research and collaboration.[78][90][91]\nThe CHI Center of Excellence are:[92]"

    "Disease": "Congenital insensitivity to pain",
    "Signs and symptoms": "For people with this disorder, cognition and sensation are otherwise normal; for instance, patients can still feel discriminative touch (though not always temperature), and there are generally no detectable physical abnormalities.[1][3] Congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA) is a kind of CIP categorized by patients' inability to sweat (also known as HSAN-IV).[1][4] The inability to regulate internal temperature can lead to unexplained persistent fevers.[4]\nBecause children and adults with CIP cannot perceive pain, they may not respond to pain-inducing stimuli, putting them at a high risk for infections and complications resulting from injuries.[5] Children with this condition often sustain self-inflicted damage, both in and around the oral cavity (such as having bitten off the tip of their tongue) or fractures to bones.[5] Repeated bone fractures can lead to improper healing, potentially resulting in permanent joint damage, or in severe cases, Charcot joints.[4][6] Many young children also present with persistent ear infections and damaged fingertips due to biting.[4] Unnoticed infections and corneal damage due to foreign objects in the eye are also common.[5][4][7] Particular strains of CIP put individuals at a higher risk for developing Staphylococcus aureus infections.[2][4] Depending on the genetic cause of CIP, individuals may be intellectually impaired and may have conditions such as ADHD.[4] The degree of the effect of CIP on the intellectual impairment of an individual has to do with the location of the mutation on the affected gene.[6] The life expectancy of individuals with CIP is shorter than normal life expectancy.[1]\nThere are generally two types of CIP:",
    "Causes": "CIP is caused by extremely rare genetic disorders.[2] Roughly 50% of CIP cases are inherited from a parent with CIP.[6] Of the five HSAN disorders, HSAN II, III, IV, and V are inherited via an autosomal recessive pattern, while HSAN I is inherited via an autosomal dominant pattern.[1] The breakdown of specific genetic mutation types among those diagnosed with CIP is unknown as of 2020.[4] HSAN IV, one of the more common forms of CIP, is caused by a mutation in the NTRK1 gene (also known as TrkA).[4]\nVarious case studies have demonstrated how specific genetic mutations have led to CIP. In all cases, this disorder can be in the voltage-gated sodium channel SCN9A (Nav1.7).[9] There are three mutations in SCN9A: W897X, located in the P-loop of domain 2; I767X, located in the S2 segment of domain 2; and S459X, located in the linker region between domains 1 and 2.[10] This results in a truncated non-functional protein.[10] Nav1.7 channels are expressed at high levels in nociceptive neurons of the dorsal root ganglia.[10] As these channels are likely involved in the formation and propagation of action potentials in such neurons, it is expected that a loss-of-function mutation in SCN9A leads to abolished nociceptive pain propagation.[10][11]\nThe PRDM12 gene is normally switched on during the development of pain-sensing nerve cells.[12] People with homozygous mutations of the PRDM12 gene experience congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP).[12][13]\nAnother gene implicated in human pain insensitivity is ZFHX2, which encodes zinc finger homeobox 2.[14] A 2018 study analyzed six members of a family with inherited pain insensitivity and identified a \"novel point mutation in ZFHX2, encoding a putative transcription factor expressed in small diameter sensory neurons\" as the cause.[14] As a therapeutic application, the study further discusses how \"the ZFHX2 variant and downstream regulated genes associated with a human pain-insensitive phenotype are ... potential novel targets for the development of new analgesic drugs\".[14]\nJo Cameron is an example of one individual known to have congenital analgesia. She has two mutations, one in the gene encoding fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and one in the pseudogene FAAH-OUT modulating FAAH expression, which are theorized to be responsible for her condition.[15][16][17][18] FAAH is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of endocannabinoids like anandamide.[19][20][21][17][18] Cameron has high levels of anandamide and other endocannabinoids.[15][17][18]",
    "Treatment": "As of 2020, there is no agreed-upon method in the medical community for treating CIP.[4] Treatment plans involve injury management and prevention.[6] In an experimental trial, an opioid antagonist, naloxone, allowed a woman with CIP to experience pain for the first time.[22] This result revealed that opioid antagonists like naloxone and naltrexone may be effective in treating CIP in the future.[22] Additionally, the genes that cause CIP provide promising targets for novel pain medications, also known as analgesics.[2]",
    "Epidemiology": "A 2020 estimate places the incidence of CIP as one person in a million, based on the observation that under thirty cases are known in the United Kingdom.[1][4] CIP is found at an abnormally high frequency in Vittangi, a village in Kiruna Municipality in northern Sweden, where nearly 40 cases have been reported.[23]"

Since people with this condition are unable to sweat, they are unable to properly regulate their body temperature.[1] Those affected are unable to feel pain and temperature.[2][3]\nThe absence of pain experienced by people with CIPA puts them at high risk for accidental self-injury. Corneal ulceration occurs due to a lack of protective impulses.[4] Joint and bone problems are common due to repeated injuries, and wounds heal poorly.[5]\nDelayed developmental milestones in early years may be observed.[6]\nPatients often have severe learning difficulties, irritability, hyperactivity, self-injurious behaviour, and cognitive impairment,[6] but patients with normal intelligence have also been reported.[6]",
    "Causes": "CIPA is caused by a genetic mutation that prevents the formation of nerve cells responsible for transmitting signals of pain, heat, and cold in the brain.\nThe disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion.[6]\nCIPA is caused by a mutation in NTRK1,[6] a gene encoding the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor.[7] NTRK1 is a receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF). This protein induces outgrowth of axons and dendrites and promotes the survival of embryonic sensory and sympathetic neurons. The mutation in NTRK1 does not allow NGF to bind properly, causing defects in the development and function of nociceptive reception.[3]\nMitochondrial abnormalities in muscle cells have been found in people with CIPA. Skin biopsies show a lack of innervation of the eccrine glands[4] and nerve biopsies show a lack of small myelinated and unmyelinated fibers.[4][8][3]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is made based on clinical criteria, supported by nerve biopsy findings of reduced unmyelinated and small myelinated fibres, and can be confirmed with genetic testing.[1][2]\nThe absence of or significantly reduced sweating in CIPA patients can be used for a differential diagnosis.[6]",

    "Disease": "Corticobasal degeneration",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Because CBD is progressive, a standard set of diagnostic criteria can be used, which is centred on the disease's evolution.  Included in these fundamental features are problems with cortical processing, dysfunction of the basal ganglia, and a sudden and detrimental onset.[2]  Psychiatric and cognitive dysfunctions, although present in CBD, are much less prevalent and lack establishment as common indicators of the presence of the disease.[3]\nAlthough corticobasal degeneration has a plethora of symptoms, some are more prevalent than others. In a study of 147 patients with CBD, it was found that all of them had at least one Parkinsonian sign, 95% having two and 93% had some higher order dysfunction (cognitive impairments like acalculia, sensory loss, dementia, neglect, etc.). In a separate study of 14 patients recorded 3 years after the onset of symptoms, many patients had high numbers of motor symptoms. 71% had bradykinesia (slow movements), 64% showed apraxia, 43% reported limb dystonia, and although more cognitive 36% had dementia. In another study of 36, over half had a useless/alien arm and 27% had a gait impediment[21]. From this, we can see why CBD is hard to diagnose. Even if it can be distinguished as different from one of the other similar diseases, the varying combinations of symptoms create a difficult path to diagnosis.[citation needed]\nSome of the most prevalent symptom types in people exhibiting CBD pertain to identifiable movement disorders and problems with cortical processing.  These symptoms are initial indicators of the presence of the disease.  Each of the associated movement complications typically appears asymmetrically and the symptoms are not observed uniformly throughout the body.  For example, a person exhibiting an alien hand syndrome (explained later) in one hand, will not correspondingly display the same symptom in the other hand.  Predominant movement disorders and cortical dysfunctions associated with CBD include:[citation needed]\nThe presence of parkinsonism as a clinical symptom of CBD is largely responsible for complications in developing unique diagnostic criteria for the disease.[4]  Other such diseases in which parkinsonism forms an integral diagnostic characteristic are Parkinson's disease (PD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).  Parkinsonism in CBD is largely present in an extremity such as the arm, and is always asymmetric. It has been suggested that the non-dominant arm is involved more often.[5] Common associated movement dysfunctions that comprise parkinsonism are rigidity, bradykinesia, and gait disorder, with limb rigidity forming the most typical manifestation of parkinsonism in CBD.  Despite being relatively indistinct, this rigidity can lead to disturbances in gait and correlated movements.  Bradykinesia in CBD occurs when there is notable slowing in the completion of certain movements in the limbs.  In an associated study, it was determined that, three years following first diagnosis, 71% of persons with CBD demonstrate the presence of bradykinesia.[3]\nAlien hand syndrome has been shown to be prevalent in roughly 60% of people diagnosed with CBD.[6]  This disorder involves the failure of an individual to control the movements of their hand, which results from the sensation that the limb is \"foreign\".[2]  The movements of the alien limb are a reaction to external stimuli and do not occur sporadically or without stimulation.  The presence of an alien limb has a distinct appearance in CBD, in which the diagnosed individual may have a \"tactile mitgehen\". This mitgehen [1] (German, meaning \"to go with\") is relatively specific to CBD, and involves the active following of an experimenter's hand by the subject's hand when both hands are in direct contact.  Another, rarer form of alien hand syndrome has been noted in CBD, in which an individual's hand displays an avoidance response to external stimuli.  Additionally, sensory impairment, revealed through limb numbness or the sensation of prickling, may also concurrently arise with alien hand syndrome, as both symptoms are indicative of cortical dysfunction.  Like most of the movement disorders, alien hand syndrome also presents asymmetrically in those diagnosed with CBD.[7]\nIdeomotor apraxia (IMA), although clearly present in CBD, often manifests atypically due to the additional presence of bradykinesia and rigidity in those individuals exhibiting the disorders.  The IMA symptom in CBD is characterized by the inability to repeat or mimic particular movements (whether significant or random) both with or without the implementation of objects.  This form of IMA is present in the hands and arms, while IMA in the lower extremities may cause problems with walking.  Those with CBD that exhibit IMA may appear to have trouble initiating walking, as the foot may appear to be fixed to floor.  This can cause stumbling and difficulties in maintaining balance.[3]  IMA is associated with deterioration in the premotor cortex, parietal association areas, connecting white matter tracts, thalamus, and basal ganglia.  Some individuals with CBD exhibit limb-kinetic apraxia, which involves dysfunction of finer motor movements often performed by the hands and fingers.[6]\nAphasia in CBD is revealed through the inability to speak or a difficulty in initiating spoken dialogue and falls under the non-fluent (as opposed to fluent or flowing) subtype of the disorder. This may be related to speech impairment such as dysarthria, and thus is not a true aphasia, as aphasia is related to a change in language function, such as difficulty retrieving words or putting words together to form meaningful sentences.   The speech and/or language impairments in CBD result in disconnected speech patterns and the omission of words.  Individuals with this symptom of CBD often lose the ability to speak as the disease progresses.[3]\nPsychiatric problems associated with CBD often present as a result of the debilitating symptoms of the disease.  Prominent psychiatric and cognitive conditions cited in individuals with CBD include dementia, depression, and irritability, with dementia forming a key feature that sometimes leads to the misdiagnosis of CBD as another cognitive disorder such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Frontotemporal dementia can be an early feature.[8]",
    "Diagnosis": "New diagnostic criteria known as the Armstrong criteria were proposed in 2013, although the accuracy of these is limited and further research is needed.[18]\nRecent findings in clinicopathology have made it possible to distinguish CBD from Parkinson's and increase the accuracy of diagnosis, using developments in MRI and nuclear medicine.[19]\nSymptoms may be symmetric or asymmetric.\nOne or more of:[citation needed]\nMore likely (probable sporadic CBS) if:[citation needed]\nTwo of:[citation needed]\nEffortful, agrammatic speech plus at least one of:[citation needed]\nThree of:[citation needed]\nThese apply to all types of CBD.\nThe diagnostic criteria for clinical use may result in a misdiagnosis of other tau-based diseases.[18]\nThe probable criteria are proposed for clinical research.[18]\nOne of the most significant problems associated with CBD is the inability to perform a definitive diagnosis while an individual exhibiting the symptoms associated with CBD is still alive.  A clinical diagnosis of CBD is performed based upon the specified diagnostic criteria, which focus mainly on the symptoms correlated with the disease.  However, this often results in complications as these symptoms often overlap with numerous other neurodegenerative diseases.[21]  Frequently, a differential diagnosis for CBD is performed, in which other diseases are eliminated based on specific symptoms that do not overlap.  However, some of the symptoms of CBD used in this process are rare to the disease, and thus the differential diagnosis cannot always be used.[3]\nPostmortem diagnosis provides the only true indication of the presence of CBD.  Most of these diagnoses utilize the Gallyas-Braak staining method, which is effective in identifying the presence of astroglial inclusions and coincidental tauopathy.[citation needed]\nProgressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is frequently the disease most often confused with CBD.  Both PSP and CBD result in similar symptoms, and both display tauopathies upon histological inspection.[22]  However, it has been noted that tauopathy in PSP results in tuft-shaped astrocytes in contrast with the ring-shaped astrocytic plaques found as a result of CBD.[13]\nIndividuals diagnosed with PD often exhibit similar movement dysfunction as those diagnosed with CBD, which adds complexity to its diagnosis.  Some other neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) also show commonalities with CBD.[3][23][8]\nThe types of imaging techniques that are most prominently utilized when studying and/or diagnosing CBD are:[citation needed]\nDevelopments or improvements in imaging techniques provide the future possibility for definitive clinical diagnosis prior to death.  However, despite their benefits, information learned from MRI and SPECT during the beginning of CBD progression tend to show no irregularities that would indicate the presence of such a neurodegenerative disease.[3]  FDOPA PET is used to study the efficacy of the dopamine pathway.[24]\nDespite the undoubted presence of cortical atrophy (as determined through MRI and SPECT) in individuals experiencing the symptoms of CBD, this is not an exclusive indicator for the disease.  Thus, the utilization of this factor in the diagnosis of CBD should be used only in combination with other clinically present dysfunctions.[4]\nMRI images are useful in displaying atrophied portions of neuroanatomical positions within the brain.  As a result, it is especially effective in identifying regions within different areas of the brain that have been negatively affected due to the complications associated with CBD.  To be specific, MRI of CBD typically shows posterior parietal and frontal cortical atrophy with unequal representation in corresponding sides.  In addition, atrophy has been noted in the corpus callosum.[24]\nFunctional MRI (fMRI) has been used to evaluate the activation patterns in various regions of the brain of individuals affected with CBD.  Upon the performance of simple finger motor tasks, subjects with CBD experienced lower levels of activity in the parietal cortex, sensorimotor cortex, and supplementary motor cortex than those individuals tested in a control group.[24]\nSPECT is currently being used to try to detect CBD. With many patients of CBD, there are areas in the basal ganglia which have difficulties receiving dopamine, typically asymmetrically. Specifically affected, are dopamine transporters which are presynaptic on the nigrostriatal cells. SPECT is used to detect these abnormalities in Dopamine transporters. Given that many patients have asymmetrical loss of function and metabolism this can help differentiate patients with CBD and those with Alzheimer's.[citation needed]\nSPECT studies of individuals diagnosed with CBD involve perfusion analysis throughout the parts of the brain.  SPECT evaluation through perfusion observation consists of monitoring blood release into different locations in tissue or organ regions, which, in the case of CBD, pertains to localized areas within the brain.  Tissue can be characterized as experiencing overperfusion, underperfusion, hypoperfusion, or hyperperfusion.  Overperfusion and underperfusion relate to a comparison with the overall perfusion levels within the entire body, whereas hypoperfusion and hyperperfusion are calculated in comparison to the blood flow requirements of the tissue in question.  In general, the measurements taken for CBD using SPECT are referred to as regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF).[24]\nIn general, SPECT reveals hypoperfusion within both the posterior regions of the frontal and parietal lobes.  As in images gathered through MRI, SPECT images indicated asymmetry in the presentation of abnormalities throughout the brain.[4]  Additional studies have revealed the presence of perfusion anomalies in the thalamus, temporal cortex, basal ganglia, and pontocerebellar (from the pons to the cerebellum) locations within subjects' brains.[24]\nResearch has suggested that the integrity of the dopamine system in the striatum has been damaged as an effect of CBD.  Current studies employing the use of FDOPA PET scanning (FDOPA PET) as a possible method for identifying CBD have focused on analyzing the efficiency of neurons in the striatum that utilize the neurotransmitter dopamine.  These studies have concluded that, in general, dopamine uptake was diminished in the caudate and the putamen.  This characteristic also has the potential to be useful in distinguishing CBD from the similar PD, as individuals having been diagnosed with PD were more likely to have a lower uptake of dopamine than in individuals with CBD.[24]\nOther clinical tests or procedures that monitor the presence of dopamine within the brain (β-CIT SPECT and IBZM SPECT) have shown similar findings.  β-CIT serves as an indicator for presynaptic dopaminergic neurons, whereas IBZM is a tracer that shows an affinity for the postsynaptic neurons of the same type.  Despite agreement with other imaging studies, these two SPECT methods suffer some scrutiny due to better accuracy in other imaging methods.  However, β-CIT SPECT has proven to be helpful in distinguishing CBD from PSP and multiple system atrophy (MSA).[24]\nAll of the disorders and dysfunctions associated with CBD can often be categorized into a class of symptoms that present with the disease of CBD.  These symptoms that aid in clinical diagnosis are collectively referred to as corticobasal syndrome (CBS) or corticobasal degeneration syndrome (CBDS). Alzheimer's disease, Pick's disease, FTDP-17 and progressive supranuclear palsy can display a corticobasal syndrome.[25][14] It has been suggested that the nomenclature of corticobasal degeneration only be used for naming the disease after it has received verification through postmortem analysis of the neuropathology.[4]  CBS patients with greater temporoparietal degeneration are more likely to have AD pathology as opposed to frontotemporal lobar degeneration.[15]",
    "Treatment": "Because the exact cause of CBD is unknown, there is no formal treatment for the disease.  Instead, treatments focus on minimizing the appearance or effect of symptoms. The most easily treatable symptom of CBD is parkinsonism, most commonly treated with dopaminergic drugs.  However, there is usually only moderate improvement, and the relief from the symptom is not long-lasting.  In addition, palliative therapies, including the use of wheelchairs, speech therapy, and feeding techniques, are often used to alleviate many of the symptoms that are not improved by medication.[17]\nMany treatments have low success rates or have not been tested thoroughly or produced frequently. For example, in relation to the motor aspect of disability, CBD has high resistance against treatments to improve dopamine intake, such as levodopa. A number of studies have reported no real levels of improvement based on similar drugs/dopaminergic agonists. Because of the brain's levels of inhibition, some medications have focused on creating an inhibition that would negate the effect. Many of these relaxants and anticonvulsants have some success but also have unwanted side effects[21][clarification needed].\nCognitive and associative effects of CBD are also hard to treat as the effects of many of the treatments for the symptomatic conditions that ensue such as dementia, aphasia, neglect, and apraxia are not well understood.[citation needed]",
    "Prognosis": "The prognosis for an individual diagnosed with CBD is death within approximately eight years, although some patients have been diagnosed in 2000 but were still in relatively good condition in 2017, albeit with serious debilitation such as dysphagia, and overall limb rigidity.[citation needed] The partial (or total) use of a feeding tube may be necessary and will help prevent aspiration pneumonia, primary cause of death in CBD. Incontinence is common, as  patients often can't express their need to go, due to eventual loss of speech. Therefore, proper hygiene is mandatory to prevent urinary tract infections.[3]",
    "Epidemiology": "Clinical presentation of CBD usually does not occur until age 60, with the earliest recorded diagnosis and subsequent postmortem verification being age 28.[24]  Although men and women present with the disease, some analysis has shown a predominant appearance of CBD in women.  Current calculations suggest that the prevalence of CBD is approximately 4.9 to 7.3 per 100,000 people.\nCBD research has been limited by the rarity of the disease and the lack of research criteria. It is estimated to affect 0.6-0.9 per 100,000 per year.[citation needed]\nProgressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) without CBD is estimated to be ten times more common. CBD represents roughly 4–6% of patients with Parkinsonism. Average age at disease onset is about 64, with the youngest confirmed onset being at age 43. There may be a slight female predominance.[16]",
    "Society and culture": "PSPA is a  British charity, set up in 1994, which aims to \"create a better future\" for people with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and CBD through information, support and research.[28][29]\nThe Salt Path by Raynor Winn is an account of walking England's 630-mile South West Coast Path with her husband, whom Winn claims has corticobasal degeneration.[30]"

    "Disease": "Cranio-lenticulo-sutural dysplasia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The following are symptoms characteristic with individuals having the disorder. Individuals may display some, most, or all of these symptoms throughout the course of their life, though symptoms may vary with each patient.[2]\nOnset of the disease is in neonatal development and infancy, and symptoms tend to become evident soon after birth.",
    "Causes": "CLSD is caused by a missense mutation in the 14q13-q21 region of Chromosome 14, where the amino acid phenylalanine is mistranslated and replaced with leucine. Amino acid sequences are encoded in the DNA of each cell in an organism, which is transcribed into RNA and then translated in a ribosome (in this case, the ribosome is attached to the endoplasmic reticulum) which produces a chain of amino acids which makes up a protein. If an amino acid sequence isn't correct, it won't make a functional protein. The missense mutation in CLSD causes an inactivation of the SEC23A protein, which is responsible for closure of the COPII pathway.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment for CLSD is largely focused on treating the symptoms of the disorder, because it is still in the early stages of research. Symptomatic treatment is also the only option due to the genetic nature of the disorder. Treatment may include surgeries to correct facial and cranial dysmorphisms or therapy sessions to help alleviate behavioral abnormalities associated with the disorder.[citation needed]",
    "Prognosis": "Though the children affected with CLSD will have problems throughout life, the treatment for this disease thus far is symptomatic. However, prognosis is good; at the time of the most recently published articles, identified children were still alive at over 4 years of age.[4]\nMutant proteins still maintain some residual activity, allowing for the release of some collagen, but still form an extremely distended endoplasmic reticulum.[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "Creutzfeldt%E2%80%93Jakob disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The first symptom of CJD is usually rapidly progressive dementia, leading to memory loss, personality changes, and hallucinations. Myoclonus (jerky movements) typically occurs in 90% of cases, but may be absent at initial onset.[15] Other frequently occurring features include anxiety, depression, paranoia, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and psychosis.[16] This is accompanied by physical problems such as speech impairment, balance and coordination dysfunction (ataxia), changes in gait, and rigid posture. In most people with CJD, these symptoms are accompanied by involuntary movements. Rarely, unusual symptoms like the alien limb phenomenon have been observed.[17] The duration of the disease varies greatly, but sporadic (non-inherited) CJD can be fatal within months or even weeks.[18] Most affected people die six months after initial symptoms appear, often of pneumonia due to impaired coughing reflexes. About 15% of people with CJD survive for two or more years.[19]\nThe symptoms of CJD are caused by the progressive death of the brain's nerve cells, which are associated with the build-up of abnormal prion proteins forming in the brain. When brain tissue from a person with CJD is examined under a microscope, many tiny holes can be seen where the nerve cells have died. Parts of the brain may resemble a sponge where the prions were infecting the areas of the brain.[20]",
    "Causes": "CJD is a type of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE), which is caused by prions.[8] Prions are misfolded proteins that occur in the neurons of the central nervous system (CNS). The CJD prion is dangerous because it promotes refolding of cellular prion proteins into the diseased state.[21] The number of misfolded protein molecules will increase exponentially, and the process leads to a large quantity of insoluble proteins in affected cells. This mass of misfolded proteins disrupts neuronal cell function and causes cell death. Mutations in the gene for the prion protein can cause a misfolding of the dominantly alpha helical regions into beta pleated sheets. This change in conformation disables the protein's ability to undergo digestion. Once the prion is transmitted, the defective proteins invade the brain and induce other prion protein molecules to misfold in a self-sustaining feedback loop. These neurodegenerative diseases are commonly called prion diseases.[22]\nPrPC, the normal fibril cellular proteins responsible for a wide range of CNS functions, are misfolded by what current research suggests are small, highly neurotoxic oligomeric aggregates, known as PrPSc, which interact with cell surfaces to disrupt neuronal function.[23] The binding of prion oligomers to normal prion protein on neurons may trigger toxic signals similar to how oligomeric β-amyloid causes synaptic damage in Alzheimer’s disease.[23] Different conformations of PrPSc (often termed prion “strains”) are thought to cause the distinct subtypes of prion disease, explaining variations in clinical features and progression.[24] They are thought to affect signaling processes, damaging neurons and resulting in degeneration that causes the spongiform appearance in the affected brain.[25] Other forms of TSEs that are found in humans are Gerstmann–Sträussler–Scheinker syndrome, fatal familial insomnia, kuru, and variably protease-sensitive prionopathy.[26] Susceptibility and disease phenotype are influenced by a common polymorphism at codon 129 of the PRNP gene (methionine/valine). Notably, individuals homozygous at codon 129 are over-represented in sporadic CJD cases and tend to have shorter incubation periods.[27]\nThe defective protein can be transmitted by contaminated harvested human brain products, corneal grafts,[28] dural grafts,[29] or electrode[30] implants and pituitary human growth hormone, which has been replaced by recombinant human growth hormone that poses no such risk.[31]\nIt can be familial (fCJD) or it may appear without clear risk factors (sporadic form: sCJD). In the familial form, a mutation has occurred in the gene for PrP, PRNP, in that family. All types of CJD are transmissible irrespective of how they occur in the person.[32]\nIt is thought that humans can contract the variant form of the disease by eating food from animals infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), the bovine form of TSE, also known as mad cow disease. However, it can also cause sCJD in some cases.[33][34]\nCannibalism has also been implicated as a transmission mechanism for abnormal prions, causing the disease known as kuru, once found primarily among women and children of the Fore people in Papua New Guinea, who previously engaged in funerary cannibalism.[35] While the men of the tribe ate the muscle tissue of the deceased, women and children consumed other parts, such as the brain, and were more likely than men to contract kuru from infected tissue.[36]\nPrions, the infectious agent of CJD, may not be inactivated using routine surgical instrument sterilization procedures. The World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that instrumentation used in such cases be immediately destroyed after use; short of destruction, it is recommended that heat and chemical decontamination be used in combination to process instruments that come in contact with high-infectivity tissues. Thermal depolymerization also destroys prions in infected organic and inorganic matter, since the process chemically attacks protein at the molecular level, although more effective and practical methods involve destruction by combinations of detergents and enzymes similar to biological washing powders.[37]\nPeople can also develop CJD because they carry a mutation of the gene that codes for the prion protein (PRNP), located on chromosome 202p12-pter. This occurs in only 10–15% of all CJD cases.[38] In sporadic cases, the misfolding of the prion protein is a process that is hypothesized to occur as a result of the effects of aging on cellular machinery, explaining why the disease often appears later in life.[4][39] An EU study determined that \"87% of cases were sporadic, 8% genetic, 5% iatrogenic and less than 1% variant.\"[40]",
    "Diagnosis": "Testing for CJD has historically been problematic, due to the nonspecific nature of early symptoms and difficulty in safely obtaining brain tissue for confirmation. The diagnosis may initially be suspected in a person with rapidly progressing dementia, particularly when it is also found with the characteristic medical signs and symptoms such as involuntary muscle jerking,[41] difficulty with coordination/balance and walking, and visual disturbances.[4] Further testing can support the diagnosis and may include:\nIn recent years, studies have shown that the tumour marker neuron-specific enolase (NSE) is often elevated in CJD cases; however, its diagnostic utility is seen primarily when combined with a test for the 14-3-3 protein.[47] As of 2010[update], screening tests to identify infected asymptomatic individuals, such as blood donors, are not yet available, though methods have been proposed and evaluated.[48]\nImaging of the brain may be performed during medical evaluation, both to rule out other causes and to obtain supportive evidence for diagnosis. Imaging findings are variable in their appearance and also variable in sensitivity and specificity.[49] While imaging plays a lesser role in diagnosis of CJD,[50] characteristic findings on brain MRI in some cases may precede onset of clinical manifestations.[51]\nBrain MRI is the most useful imaging modality for changes related to CJD. Of the MRI sequences, diffuse-weighted imaging sequences are most sensitive.[52] Characteristic findings are as follows:\nBrain FDG PET-CT tends to be markedly abnormal, and is increasingly used in the investigation of dementias.\nTesting of tissue remains the most definitive way of confirming the diagnosis of CJD, although even a biopsy is not always conclusive.[56]\nIn one-third of people with sporadic CJD, deposits of \"prion protein (scrapie)\", PrPSc, can be found in the skeletal muscle or the spleen.[57] Diagnosis of vCJD can be supported by biopsy of the tonsils, which harbor significant amounts of PrPSc; however, biopsy of brain tissue is the definitive diagnostic test for all other forms of prion disease. Due to its invasiveness, a biopsy will not be done if clinical suspicion is sufficiently high or low. A negative biopsy does not rule out CJD, since it may predominate in a specific part of the brain.[58]\nThe classic histologic appearance is spongiform change in the gray matter: the presence of many round vacuoles from one to 50 micrometers in the neuropil, in all six cortical layers in the cerebral cortex, or with diffuse involvement of the cerebellar molecular layer.[59] These vacuoles appear glassy or eosinophilic and may coalesce. Neuronal loss and gliosis are also seen.[60] Plaques of amyloid-like material can be seen in the neocortex in some cases of CJD.[61]\nHowever, extra-neuronal vacuolization can also be seen in other disease states. Diffuse cortical vacuolization occurs in Alzheimer's disease, and superficial cortical vacuolization occurs in ischemia and frontotemporal dementia. These vacuoles appear clear and punched out. Larger vacuoles encircling neurons, vessels, and glia are a possible processing artifact.[58]\nTypes of CJD include:[62]",
    "Treatment": "As of 2025, there is no cure or effective treatment for CJD.[72] Some of the symptoms, like twitching, can be managed, but otherwise treatment is palliative care.[72] Psychiatric symptoms like anxiety and depression can be treated with sedatives and antidepressants. Myoclonic jerks can be handled with clonazepam or sodium valproate. Opiates can help with pain.[73] Seizures are very uncommon but can nevertheless be treated with antiepileptic drugs.[74]\nIn 2022, results of an early-stage trial of PRN100, a monoclonal antibody against PrP, were reported: the drug appeared safe and reached the brain, but treated patients did not show clearly improved survival compared to historical controls. While not curative, this trial demonstrated the feasibility of immunotherapy for prion disease.[75]",
    "Prognosis": "Life expectancy is greatly reduced for people with Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, and the average is less than six months. As of 1981, no one was known to have lived longer than 2.5 years after the onset of CJD symptoms.[76] One of the world's longest survivors of vCJD was Jonathan Simms, a Northern Irish man who lived for 10 years after his diagnosis and received experimental treatment with pentosan polysulfate. Simms died in 2011.[77]",
    "Epidemiology": "The CDC monitors the occurrence of CJD in the United States through periodic reviews of national mortality data. According to the CDC:[78][79][80]\nFurther information from the CDC:[82]\nAlthough not fully understood, additional information suggests that CJD rates in nonwhite groups are lower than in whites. While the mean onset is approximately 67 years of age, cases of sCJD have been reported as young as 17 years and over 80 years of age. Mental capabilities rapidly deteriorate and the average amount of time from onset of symptoms to death is 7 to 9 months.[83]\nAccording to a 2020 systematic review on the international epidemiology of CJD:[81]\nThe intensity of CJD surveillance increases the number of reported cases, often in countries where CJD epidemics have occurred in the past and where surveillance resources are greatest.[81] An increase in surveillance and reporting of CJD is most likely in response to BSE and vCJD.[83] Possible factors contributing to an increase in CJD incidence are an aging population, population increase, clinician awareness, and more accurate diagnostic methods. Since CJD symptoms are similar to other neurological conditions, it is also possible that CJD is mistaken for stroke, acute nephropathy, general dementia, and hyperparathyroidism.[81]"

    "Disease": "Cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita",
    "Signs and symptoms": "People with visible marks generally feel fine (physically) and can act normally, but when it is mentioned, they may become withdrawn and self-conscious. Some children may have low self-esteem due to the condition. CMTC is an uncommon, sporadic congenital vascular malformation characterized by a generalized or localized reticulated cutaneous vascular network.[citation needed]\nCutaneous lesions described in patients with CMTC include nevus flammeus, hemangioma, nevus anemicus, café-au-lait spots, melanocytic nevus, aplasia cutis and acral cyanosis.[5]\nIt has a marbled bluish to deep-purple appearance. The dark skin lesions often show a palpable loss of dermal substance. The reticulated mottling frequently appears more prominent in a cold environment (physiologic cutis marmorata), but tends not to disappear with warming. Hence, the erythema may be worsened by cooling, physical activity, or crying. CMTC frequently involves the extremities, with the lower extremities involved most commonly, followed by the upper extremities, and then the trunk and face. The lower extremities often show atrophy and seldom show hypertrophy resulting in limb circumference discrepancy.[citation needed]\nWhen located on the trunk, the lesions of CMTC tend to show mosaic distribution in streaks with a sharp midline demarcation seen across the abdomen.[5] The lesions are primarily localized, but can be segmental or generalized, often unilateral in appearance.[5] Diffuse involvement of the skin is usually not observed.\nAlthough its course is variable, the majority of lesions in mild cases fade by adolescence. Ulceration and secondary infection are complications in severe cases and can be fatal if present in the neonatal period.[6]",
    "Causes": "Fewer than 100 cases of CMTC have been published worldwide. Petrozzi reported the first case of CMTC in the United States in 1970.[7] CMTC is believed to be more common than suspected, as studies have shown that milder forms of the disease are not being recognized as CMTC.[5]\nThe pathophysiology is still unclear, with most cases occurring sporadically, although rare cases were reported in families. Studies indicated the primary involvement of capillaries, venules and veins, and possibly also that of arterioles and lymphatics.\nHypotheses that have been proposed include: environmental/external factors;[8] peripheral neural dysfunction; failure of the development of mesodermic vessels in an early embryonic stage; autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance and, finally, the theory of Happle.[9]",
    "Diagnosis": "During the first few weeks after birth, when the lesions are not very reticulated, CMTC may look very similar to vascular lesions such as port-wine stains. However, during follow-up, CMTC lesions become characteristic in their appearance. They must be differentiated from other causes of persistent reticulated vascular lesions, such as those in the following table:\nSome patients have a few or no histopathologic abnormalities. Histological examination of a biopsy may show an increase in the number and size of capillaries and veins (rarely lymphatics), dilated capillaries located in the deeper dermis, and hyperplasia and swollen endothelial cells with occasional dilated veins and venous lakes.[citation needed]\nAssociated abnormalities include the following:",
    "Treatment": "In general, there is no treatment available for CMTC, although associated abnormalities can be treated. In the case of limb asymmetry, when no functional problems are noted, treatment is not warranted, except for an elevation device for the shorter leg.\nLaser therapy has not been successful in the treatment of CMTC, possibly due to the presence of many large and deep capillaries and dilated veins. Pulsed-dye laser and long-pulsed-dye laser have not yet been evaluated in CMTC, but neither argon laser therapy nor YAG laser therapy has been helpful.[11]\nWhen ulcers develop secondary to the congenital disease, antibiotic treatment such as oxacillin and gentamicin administered for 10 days has been prescribed. In one study, the wound grew Escherichia coli while blood cultures were negative.[6]",
    "Prognosis": "The prognosis is favorable in most patients with an isolated cutaneous abnormality. In the majority of cases, both the vivid red marking and the difference in circumference of the extremities regress spontaneously during the first year of life. It is theorized that this may be due to the normal maturation process, with thickening of the epidermis and dermis. Improvements for some patients can continue for up to 10 years, while in other cases, the marbled skin may persist for the patient's lifetime.\nOne study reported an improvement in lesions in 46% of patients within three years.[8] If CMTC persists into adulthood, it can result in complaints due to paresthesia, increased sensitivity to cold and pain, and the formation of ulcers.[6]\nFew reports included long-term follow up of CMTC into adolescence and adulthood. While about 50% of patients seem to show definite improvement in the reticular vascular pattern,[11] the exact incidence and cause of persistent cases are unknown.",
    "Epidemiology": "CMTC is observed at birth or shortly thereafter in 94% of patients.[8] In other reports, however, patients did not develop skin lesions until three months or even two years after birth.[12][13] Females are typically affected more often than males (64%).[14]"

    "Signs and symptoms": "The common symptoms of neutropenia are recurrent fever, malaise, inflammation of the tissues surrounding the teeth, mouth ulcers, inflammation and bacterial infection of the respiratory tract, digestive tract, skin, and abdominal pain.[1][2] It is considered that the greatest risk for death is from developing necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), peritonitis, bacteremia or Clostridium and Escherichia coli sepsis and septic shock, and pneumonia.[1][3][4]",
    "Causes": "Cyclic neutropenia (CyN), like severe congenital neutropenia (SCN), is a rare disorder. It is considered that in the general population, CyN has a frequency of one in one million.[1] It is the result of autosomal dominant mutation in ELANE gene located on the short arm (p) of chromosome 19 (19p13.3), the gene encoding neutrophil elastase, which is also the most common cause of the SCN.[1][5][6][7] It sporadically occurs as a de novo mutation variant or can be present among members of the same family.[1] In the case of CyN, the mutation variants have been found to mostly cluster in intron 4 and exon 4 and 5,[6][3] but were also located in intron 3, and exon 2 and 3.[8][9][10][11][12] Some mutation variants have been found in both Cyn and SCN, which indicates they are phenotypes of the same disease with different severity.[9]\nIt is considered that the mutation causes a decrease in the \"neutrophil production or excessive apoptosis (shorter half-life)\" which results in a deficiency of mature neutrophils in the blood.[13] The exact pathological mechanism is still researched, with the main hypotheses being mislocalization of ELANE or unfolded protein response (UPR) induced by mutant ELANE,[14] however according to Mehta et al. (2016), the \"UPR induction by mutant ELANE is not strong enough to promote cell death and that mutant ELANE causes SCN through an alternative mechanism\".[15] According to Garg et al. (2020), new \"findings challenge the currently prevailing model that SCN results from mutant ELANE, which triggers endoplasmic reticulum stress, UPR, and apoptosis\".[16] The expression of the ELANE gene has been linked to GFI1 gene,[8][17] and some considered that interaction with other genes causes the emergence and severity of one or the other phenotypic disorder.[9] It is unclear what causes the cyclic aspect in CyN.[17] According to Donadieu et al. (2011), the \"cyclic aspect ... suggests the existence of a cryptic biological clock that regulates granulopoiesis. This putative clock might be revealed by particular mutations\".[13] Michael Mackey \"postulates that the production of neutrophils is governed by long‐range stimulatory factors in a long feedback loop that has a built‐in time delay in the maturation of promyelocytes to fully differentiated neutrophils\".[18] It is also not clear what causes that the levels of secretory leucocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), which influences the induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR), are not diminished and as such activation of UPR is absent in CyN compared to SCN, in other words, different ELANE mutations \"have different effects on UPR activation, and SLPI regulates the extent of ELANE‐triggered UPR\".[19]\nA 2020 study published in Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences about the pathomechanism of CyN revealed that \"some HSPCs escape the UPR‐induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and proliferate in response to granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor (G‐CSF) to a certain threshold at which UPR again affects the majority of HSPCs. There is a cyclic balance between ER stress-induced apoptosis of HSPCs and compensatory G‐CSF–stimulated HSPC proliferation followed by granulocytic differentiation\"; in other words, CyN is \"characterized by cycling UPR activities and cycling UPR‐escaping cells\". Also, the most probable reason that from the same mutation variant develops SCN and not CyN is due to more severe damage caused by UPR stress in SCN.[18]",
    "Diagnosis": "A diagnosis is usually confirmed by monitoring absolute neutrophil (ANC) count three times per week for at least six weeks.[1][3] The confirmation can be assisted with Lomb periodogram.[20] During the condition, which lasts for three to six days and tends to occur approximately every three weeks (but can range from 14 to 36 days),[2][3] the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is less than 200-500 cells/μL (<0.2-0.5 billion/L), with increase of monocyte counts, and mild oscillations of other cells, including a mild anemia.[1][21] Between cycles the neutrophil count mostly peaks at subnormal or normal values.[17]\nGenetic testing is advised for mutations in the ELANE and other neutropenia related genes (like HAX1, G6PC3, GFI1 etc.) to differentiate it from other secondary causes and forms of neutropenia.[1][22] In some cases intervals and oscillations can be lower, making the ANC analysis insufficient,[1] and since both disorders can have the same mutation variants in ELANE it is preferable to have both ANC and genetic analysis to confirm in the diagnosis whether it is severe congenital or cyclic neutropenia.[21][20]",
    "Treatment": "Although individuals between cycles are generally healthy and symptoms tend to improve in adulthood, it is advised avoiding activities prone to injuries, to have regular oral and dental care,[2] and BCG vaccine to be avoided.[1][13] It is advised monitoring white blood cells several times a year. The treatment following the symptoms should be immediate to prevent infections, especially during a fever when it requires broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (see febrile neutropenia). The most important and often life-saving treatment is the preventive therapy of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), in the form of filgrastim, which regulates the production of neutrophils within the bone marrow, but shortens the neutropenic cycle to about 7-14 days and the duration of the severe condition.[1][17] The subcutaneous injections, with median dosage of 1.5 μg/kg/day,[18] can be given daily, intermittently once every three days, or timed to just treat the neutropenic period.[13][23] The therapy is considered to be \"safe and effective\", with no significant adverse effects,[24] besides a possibility of development of osteopenia.[21]\nThe granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is less effective with more adverse effects. Another alternative is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), but is usually practiced in SCN,[1] and in one case between two sibling donors, one of which was undergoing HSCT treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) while the second had CyN and whose marrow was transferred, was also transferred CyN through allogeneic marrow grafting. It shows that CyN is a stem cell disorder.[25] Yearly bone marrow examinations are not recommended.[23]",
    "Prognosis": "There is a very high risk of life-threatening infections and death at an early age.[13] The quality of life and survival greatly improves with G-CSF treatment, which is practiced since the late 1980s.[21] Unlike severe congenital neutropenia, individuals with cyclic neutropenia have a better response to G-CSF and do not have a risk of developing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).[1][3] However, in long-term observation of over 300 patients with CyN, there has been one case of developing chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and one of AML,[21][24] indicating it is also a pre-leukemic condition, but the risk is \"very low\" (1%[18]),[26] and the risk is \"correlated with disease severity rather than with occurrence of an ELANE mutation\".[10] According to Donadieu et al. (2011), \"the cumulative risk of experiencing at least one serious (potentially life-threatening) infection by age 20 years is similar in patients with permanent and cyclic neutropenia, although the former patients tend to have earlier manifestations\".[13]"

    "Disease": "Cystic fibrosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Cystic fibrosis typically manifests early in life. Newborns and infants with cystic fibrosis tend to have frequent, large, greasy stools (a result of malabsorption) and are underweight for their age.[17]: Clinical Manifestations  Of newborns, 15–20% have their small intestine blocked by meconium, often requiring surgery to correct.[17]: Clinical Manifestations  Newborns occasionally have neonatal jaundice due to blockage of the bile ducts.[17]: Clinical Manifestations  Children with cystic fibrosis lose excessive salt in their sweat, and parents often notice salt crystallizing on the skin, or a salty taste when they kiss their child.[17]: Clinical Manifestations\nThe primary cause of morbidity and death in people with cystic fibrosis is progressive lung disease, which eventually leads to respiratory failure.[17]: Respiratory Tract  This typically begins as a prolonged respiratory infection that continues until treated with antibiotics.[17]: Respiratory Tract  Chronic infection of the respiratory tract is nearly universal in people with cystic fibrosis, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, fungi, and mycobacteria all becoming increasingly common over time.[18] Inflammation of the upper airway results in frequent runny nose and nasal obstruction. Nasal polyps are common, particularly in children and teenagers.[17]: Respiratory Tract  As the disease progresses, people tend to have shortness of breath, and a chronic cough that produces sputum.[17]: Biliary Tract  Breathing problems make it increasingly challenging to exercise, and prolonged illness causes those affected to be underweight for their age.[17]: Biliary Tract  In late adolescence or adulthood, people begin to develop severe signs of lung disease: wheezing, digital clubbing, cyanosis, coughing up blood, pulmonary heart disease, and collapsed lung (atelectasis or pneumothorax).[17]: Respiratory Tract\nIn rare cases, cystic fibrosis can manifest itself as a coagulation disorder. Vitamin K is normally absorbed from breast milk, formula, and later, solid foods. This absorption is impaired in some CF patients. Young children are especially sensitive to vitamin K malabsorptive disorders because only a very small amount of vitamin K crosses the placenta, leaving the child with very low reserves and limited ability to absorb vitamin K from dietary sources after birth. Because clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X are vitamin K–dependent, low levels of vitamin K can result in coagulation problems. Consequently, when a child presents with unexplained bruising, a coagulation evaluation may be warranted to determine whether an underlying disease is present.[19]\nLung disease results from clogging of the airways due to mucus build-up, decreased mucociliary clearance, and resulting inflammation.[20][21] In later stages, changes in the architecture of the lung, such as pathology in the major airways (bronchiectasis), further exacerbate difficulties in breathing. Other signs include high blood pressure in the lung (pulmonary hypertension), heart failure, difficulties getting enough oxygen to the body (hypoxia), and respiratory failure requiring support with breathing masks, such as bilevel positive airway pressure machines or ventilators.[22] Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the three most common organisms causing lung infections in CF patients.[21]: 1254  In addition, opportunistic infection due to Burkholderia cepacia complex can occur, especially through transmission from patient to patient.[23]\nIn addition to typical bacterial infections, people with CF more commonly develop other types of lung diseases. Among these is allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, in which the body's response to the common fungus Aspergillus fumigatus causes worsening of breathing problems. Another is infection with Mycobacterium avium complex, a group of bacteria related to tuberculosis, which can cause lung damage and do not respond to common antibiotics.[24]\nThe mucus in the paranasal sinuses is equally thick and may also cause blockage of the sinus passages, leading to infection. This may cause facial pain, fever, nasal drainage, and headaches. Individuals with CF may develop overgrowth of the nasal tissue (nasal polyps) due to inflammation from chronic sinus infections.[25] Recurrent sinonasal polyps can occur in 10% to 25% of CF patients.[21]: 1254  These polyps can block the nasal passages and increase breathing difficulties.[26][27]\nCardiorespiratory complications are the most common causes of death (about 80%) in patients at most CF centers in the United States.[21]: 1254\nDigestive problems are also prevalent in individuals with CF. Approximately 15%-20% of newborns diagnosed with CF experience intestinal blockage (meconium ileus), and other digestive issues may arise due to mucus accumulation in the pancreas.[28] Consequently, there is impaired insulin production, leading to cystic fibrosis-related diabetes mellitus. Moreover, enzyme transport disruption from the pancreas to the intestines results in digestive problems such as recurrent diarrhea or weight loss.[29]\nIn cystic fibrosis, there is impaired chloride secretion due to the mutation of CFTR. This disrupts the ionic balance, causes impaired bicarbonate secretion, and alters the pH. The pancreatic enzymes that work in a specific pH range cannot act as the chyme is not neutralized by bicarbonate ions. This causes impairment of the digestion process.[30]\nThe thick mucus seen in the lungs has a counterpart in thickened secretions from the pancreas, an organ responsible for providing digestive juices that help break down food. These secretions block the exocrine movement of the digestive enzymes into the duodenum and result in irreversible damage to the pancreas, often with painful inflammation (pancreatitis).[31] The pancreatic ducts are totally plugged in more advanced cases, usually seen in older children or adolescents.[21] This causes atrophy of the exocrine glands and progressive fibrosis.[21]\nIn addition, protrusion of internal rectal membranes (rectal prolapse) is more common, occurring in as many as 10% of children with CF,[21] and it is caused by increased fecal volume, malnutrition, and increased intra–abdominal pressure due to coughing.[32]\nIndividuals with CF also have difficulties absorbing the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K.[33]\nIn addition to the pancreas problems, people with CF experience more heartburn,[33] intestinal blockage by intussusception, and constipation.[34] Older individuals with CF may develop distal intestinal obstruction syndrome, which occurs when feces becomes thick with mucus (inspissated) and can cause bloating, pain, and incomplete or complete bowel obstruction.[35][33]\nExocrine pancreatic insufficiency occurs in the majority (85–90%) of patients with CF.[21]: 1253  It is mainly associated with \"severe\" CFTR mutations, where both alleles are completely nonfunctional (e.g. ΔF508/ΔF508).[21]: 1253  It occurs in 10–15% of patients with one \"severe\" and one \"mild\" CFTR mutation where little CFTR activity still occurs, or where two \"mild\" CFTR mutations exist.[21]: 1253  In these milder cases, a sufficient pancreatic exocrine function is still present so enzyme supplementation is not required.[21]: 1253  Usually, no other GI complications occur in pancreas-sufficient phenotypes, and in general, such individuals usually have excellent growth and development.[21]: 1254  Despite this, idiopathic chronic pancreatitis can occur in a subset of pancreas-sufficient individuals with CF, and is associated with recurrent abdominal pain and life-threatening complications.[21]\nLiver diseases are another common complication in CF patients. The prevalence in studies ranged from 18% at age two to 41% at age 12, with no significant increase thereafter.[36] Another study found that males with CF are more prone to liver diseases compared to females, and those with meconium ileus have an increased risk of liver diseases.[37]\nThickened secretions also may cause liver problems in patients with CF. Bile secreted by the liver to aid in digestion may block the bile ducts, leading to liver damage. Impaired digestion or absorption of lipids can result in steatorrhea. Over time, this can lead to scarring and nodularity (cirrhosis). The liver fails to rid the blood of toxins and does not make important proteins, such as those responsible for blood clotting.[38][39] Liver disease is the third-most common cause of death associated with CF.[21]\nAround 5–7% of people experience liver damage severe enough to cause symptoms: typically gallstones causing biliary colic.[17]: Biliary Tract\nThe pancreas contains the islets of Langerhans, which are responsible for making insulin, a hormone that helps regulate blood glucose. Damage to the pancreas can lead to loss of the islet cells, leading to a type of diabetes unique to those with the disease.[40] This cystic fibrosis-related diabetes shares characteristics of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and is one of the principal nonpulmonary complications of CF.[41]\nVitamin D is involved in calcium and phosphate regulation. Poor uptake of vitamin D from the diet because of malabsorption can lead to the bone disease osteoporosis in which weakened bones are more susceptible to fractures.[42]\nInfertility affects both men and women. At least 97% of men with cystic fibrosis are infertile, but not sterile, and can have children with assisted reproductive techniques.[43] The main cause of infertility in men with cystic fibrosis is congenital absence of the vas deferens (which normally connects the testes to the ejaculatory ducts of the penis), but potentially also by other mechanisms causing no sperm, abnormally shaped sperm, and few sperm with poor motility.[44] Many men found to have congenital absence of the vas deferens during evaluation for infertility have a mild, previously undiagnosed form of CF.[45] While females with CF are generally fertile, around 20% of women with CF have fertility difficulties due to thickened cervical mucus or malnutrition. In severe cases, malnutrition disrupts ovulation and causes a lack of menstruation.[46]",
    "Causes": "CF is caused by having no functional copies (alleles) of the gene cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). As of 2018, over 1,900 mutations leading to CF have been described, but only 5 of them have a frequency greater than 1% among patients. The most common mutant allele, ΔF508 (also termed F508del), is a deletion (Δ signifying deletion) of three nucleotides that results in a loss of the amino-acid residue phenylalanine (F) at the 508th position of the protein.[47][48] This mutant allele is already present in 1 in 20 to 25 people of Northern European ancestry; it accounts for 70% of CF cases worldwide and 90% of cases in the United States; however, over 700 other mutant alleles, some of which represent new mutations, can produce CF.[49] Although most people have two working copies (alleles) of the CFTR gene, only one is needed to prevent cystic fibrosis. CF develops when neither allele can produce a functional CFTR protein. Thus, CF is considered an autosomal recessive disease.[50]\nThe CFTR gene, found at the q31.2 locus of chromosome 7, is 230,000 base pairs long, and encodes a protein that is 1,480 amino acids long. More specifically, the location is between base pair 117,120,016 and 117,308,718 on the long arm of chromosome 7, region 3, band 1, subband 2, represented as 7q31.2. Structurally, the CFTR is a type of gene known as an ABC gene. The product of this gene (the CFTR protein) is a chloride ion channel important in creating sweat, digestive juices, and mucus. This protein possesses two ATP-hydrolyzing domains, which allows the protein to use energy in the form of ATP. It also contains two domains comprising six alpha helices apiece, which allow the protein to cross the cell membrane. A regulatory binding site on the protein allows activation by phosphorylation, mainly by cAMP-dependent protein kinase.[22] The carboxyl terminal of the protein is anchored to the cytoskeleton by a PDZ domain interaction.[51] Most CFTR in lung passages is produced by rare ion-transporting cells that regulate mucus properties.[52]\nIn addition, the evidence is increasing that genetic modifiers besides CFTR modulate the frequency and severity of the disease. One example is mannan-binding lectin, which is involved in innate immunity by facilitating phagocytosis of microorganisms. Polymorphisms in one or both mannan-binding lectin alleles that result in lower circulating levels of the protein are associated with a threefold higher risk of end-stage lung disease, as well as an increased burden of chronic bacterial infections.[21]\nUp to one in 25 individuals of Northern European ancestry is considered a genetic carrier.[53] The disease appears only when two of these carriers have children, as each pregnancy between them has a 25% chance of producing a child with the disease. Although only about one of every 3,000 newborns of the affected ancestry has CF, since the CFTR gene's discovery in 1989, over 2,000 variants have been identified, but only about 700 of these have been recognized as responsible for causing CF.[54] Current tests look for the most common mutations.[53]\nThe mutant alleles screened by the test vary according to a person's ethnic group or by the occurrence of CF already in the family. More than 10 million Americans, including one in 25 white Americans, are carriers of one mutant allele of the CF gene. CF is present in other races, though not as frequently as in white individuals. About one in 46 Hispanic Americans, one in 65 African Americans, and one in 90 Asian Americans carry a mutation of the CF gene.[53]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis of CF is initially based on clinical findings indicative of respiratory diseases, various digestive problems, meconium ileus, and more. Definitive diagnosis may involve genetic testing based on family history or chloride concentration testing in sweat, which is relatively high (>60mEq/L) in individuals with CF.[citation needed]\nIn many localities all newborns are screened for cystic fibrosis within the first few days of life, typically by blood test for high levels of immunoreactive trypsinogen.[79] Newborns with positive tests or those who are otherwise suspected of having cystic fibrosis based on symptoms or family history, then undergo a sweat test. An electric current is used to drive pilocarpine into the skin, stimulating sweating. The sweat is collected and analyzed for salt levels. Having unusually high levels of chloride in the sweat suggests CFTR is dysfunctional; the person is then diagnosed with cystic fibrosis.[17]: Diagnosis and Assessment [note 1] Genetic testing is also available to identify the CFTR mutations typically associated with cystic fibrosis. Many laboratories can test for the 30–96 most common CFTR mutations, which can identify over 90% of people with cystic fibrosis.[17]: Diagnosis and Assessment\nPeople with CF have less thiocyanate and hypothiocyanite in their saliva[81] and mucus (Banfi et al.). In the case of milder forms of CF, transepithelial potential difference measurements can be helpful. CF can also be diagnosed by the identification of mutations in the CFTR gene.[82]\nIn many cases, a parent makes the diagnosis because the infant tastes salty.[21] Immunoreactive trypsinogen levels can be increased in individuals who have a single mutated copy of the CFTR gene (carriers) or, in rare instances, in individuals with two normal copies of the CFTR gene. Due to these false positives, CF screening in newborns can be controversial.[83][84]\nBy 2010 every US state had instituted newborn screening programs[85] and as of 2016[update] 21 European countries had programs in at least some regions.[86]\nWomen who are pregnant or couples planning a pregnancy can have themselves tested for the CFTR gene mutations to determine the risk that their child will be born with CF. Testing is typically performed first on one or both parents and, if the risk of CF is high, testing on the fetus is performed. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends all people thinking of becoming pregnant be tested to see if they are a carrier.[87]\nBecause the development of CF in the fetus requires each parent to pass on a mutated copy of the CFTR gene and because CF testing is expensive, testing is often performed initially on one parent. If testing shows that the parent is a CFTR gene mutation carrier, the other parent is tested to calculate the risk that their children will have CF. CF can result from more than a thousand different mutations.[50] As of 2016[update], typically only the most common mutations are tested for, such as ΔF508.[50] Most commercially available tests look for 32 or fewer different mutations. If a family has a known uncommon mutation, specific screening for that mutation can be performed. Because not all known mutations are found on current tests, a negative screen does not guarantee that a child will not have CF.[88]\nDuring pregnancy, testing can be performed on the placenta (chorionic villus sampling) or the fluid around the fetus (amniocentesis). However, chorionic villus sampling has a risk of fetal death of one in 100 and amniocentesis of one in 200;[89] a recent study has indicated this may be much lower, about one in 1,600.[90]\nEconomically, for carrier couples of cystic fibrosis, when comparing preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) with natural conception (NC) followed by prenatal testing and abortion of affected pregnancies, PGD provides net economic benefits up to a maternal age around 40 years, after which NC, prenatal testing, and abortion have a higher economic benefit.[91]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment for CF is diverse, tailored to different symptoms, and includes various devices, inhalation medications to alleviate respiratory difficulties, oral enzyme supplements to address exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and, in some cases, surgical interventions for conditions such as meconium ileus.[92] While treatment alleviates symptoms and prevents potential complications, there is currently no cure for the disease.[citation needed]\nThe management of CF has improved significantly over the past 70 years. While infants born with it 70 years ago would have been unlikely to live beyond their first year, infants today are likely to live well into adulthood. Advances in the treatment of cystic fibrosis have meant that people with cystic fibrosis can live a fuller life less encumbered by their condition. The cornerstones of management are the proactive treatment of airway infection, encouragement of good nutrition, and an active lifestyle. Pulmonary rehabilitation as a management of CF continues throughout a person's life, and is aimed at maximizing organ function, and therefore the quality of life.[93] Occupational therapists use energy conservation techniques in the rehabilitation process for patients with cystic fibrosis.[94] Examples of energy conservation techniques are ergonomic principles, pursed lip breathing, and diaphragmatic breathing.[95] People with CF tend to have fatigue and dyspnoea due to chronic pulmonary infections, so reducing the amount of energy spent during activities can help people feel better and gain more independence.[94] At best, current treatments delay the decline in organ function.[citation needed] Because of the wide variation in disease symptoms, treatment typically occurs at specialist multidisciplinary centers and is tailored to the individual. Targets for therapy are the lungs, gastrointestinal tract (including pancreatic enzyme supplements), the reproductive organs (including assisted reproductive technology), and psychological support.[96]\nThe most consistent aspect of therapy in CF is limiting and treating the lung damage caused by thick mucus and infection, with the goal of maintaining quality of life. Intravenous, inhaled, and oral antibiotics are used to treat chronic and acute infections. Mechanical devices and inhalation medications are used to alter and clear the thickened mucus. These therapies, while effective, can be extremely time-consuming. Oxygen therapy at home is recommended in those with significantly low oxygen levels.[97] Many people with CF use probiotics, which are thought to be able to correct intestinal dysbiosis and inflammation, but the clinical trial evidence regarding the effectiveness of probiotics for reducing pulmonary exacerbations in people with CF is uncertain.[98]\nMany people with CF are on one or more antibiotics at all times, even when healthy, to prophylactically suppress infection. The choice of antibiotics for cystic fibrosis depends on the specific bacteria that are causing the infection, as well as the patient's age, weight, and other medical conditions.[citation needed] Antibiotics are necessary whenever pneumonia is suspected or a noticeable decline in lung function is seen, and are usually chosen based on the results of a sputum analysis and the person's past response.[citation needed] This prolonged therapy often necessitates hospitalization and insertion of a more permanent IV such as a peripherally inserted central catheter or Port-a-Cath. Inhaled therapy with antibiotics such as tobramycin, colistin, and aztreonam is often given for months at a time to improve lung function by impeding the growth of colonized bacteria.[99][100][101] Inhaled antibiotic therapy helps lung function by fighting infection, but also has significant drawbacks such as development of antibiotic resistance, tinnitus, and changes in the voice.[102] Inhaled levofloxacin may be used to treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa in people with cystic fibrosis who are infected.[103]\nAntibiotics by mouth such as ciprofloxacin or azithromycin are given to help prevent infection or to control ongoing infection.[104] The aminoglycoside antibiotics (e.g. tobramycin) used can cause hearing loss, damage to the balance system in the inner ear or kidney failure with long-term use.[105] To prevent these side-effects, the amount of antibiotics in the blood is routinely measured and adjusted accordingly.[106]\nCurrently, no reliable clinical trial evidence shows the effectiveness of antibiotics for pulmonary exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis and Burkholderia cepacia complex[107] or for the use of antibiotics to treat nontuberculous mycobacteria in people with CF.[108]\nThe early management of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection is usually suggested using nebulised antibiotics with or without oral antibiotics to remove the bacteria from the person's airways for some time.[109] When choosing antibiotics to treat lung infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in people with cystic fibrosis, it is still unclear whether the choice of antibiotics should be based on the results of testing antibiotics separately (one at a time) or in combination with each other.[110] It is also unclear if these treatment approaches for the Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection improve the person's quality of life or lifespan.[109] The negative side effects of antibiotics for this infection are also poorly studied.[109] Intravenous antibiotic therapy to treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections is not any better than antibiotics taken orally.[109]\nMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections can be dangerous for people with cystic fibrosis and can worsen lung damage leading to more rapid decline. Early antibiotic treatment is standard; however, further research is needed to determine longer-term effects and benefits (3–6 months after the treatment or longer) and survival rates associated with different treatment options.[111]\nFactors related to antibiotic use, the chronicity of the disease, and the emergence of resistant bacteria demand more exploration for different strategies such as antibiotic adjuvant therapy.[112] Antibiotic adjuvant therapy refers to therapeutic approaches that aim to improve the action of antibiotics such a pharmaceutical agents or supplements that impact the virulence of the bacterium or that change the susceptibility of the organism to the antibiotic so that the antibiotics are more effective.[112] There is no strong evidence to recommend specific antibiotic adjuvant therapies such as β-carotene, nitric oxide, zinc supplements, or KB001-A.[112]\nAerosolized medications that help loosen secretions include dornase alfa and hypertonic saline.[113] Dornase is a recombinant human deoxyribonuclease, which breaks down DNA in the sputum, thus decreasing its viscosity.[114] Dornase alpha improves lung function and probably decreases the risk of exacerbations but there is insufficient evidence to know if it is more or less effective than other similar medications.[115] Dornase alpha may improve lung function; however, there is no strong evidence that it is better than other hyperosmolar therapies.[115]\nDenufosol, an investigational drug, opens an alternative chloride channel, helping to liquefy mucus.[116] Whether inhaled corticosteroids are useful is unclear, but stopping inhaled corticosteroid therapy is safe.[117] There is weak evidence that corticosteroid treatment may cause harm by interfering with growth.[117] Pneumococcal vaccination has not been studied as of 2014[update].[118] As of 2014[update], there is no clear evidence from randomized controlled trials that the influenza vaccine is beneficial for people with cystic fibrosis.[119]\nIvacaftor is a medication taken by mouth for the treatment of CF due to several specific mutations responsive to ivacaftor-induced CFTR protein enhancement.[120][121] It improves lung function by about 10%; however, as of 2014[update] it is expensive.[120] The first year it was on the market, the list price was over $300,000 per year in the United States.[120] In July 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved lumacaftor/ivacaftor.[122] In 2018, the FDA approved the combination ivacaftor/tezacaftor; the manufacturer announced a list price of $292,000 per year.[123] Tezacaftor helps move the CFTR protein to the correct position on the cell surface, and is designed to treat people with the F508del mutation.[124]\nIn 2019, the combination drug elexacaftor/ivacaftor/tezacaftor, marketed as Trikafta and described as modulator therapy,[125] was approved for CF patients over the age of 12 in the United States,[126][127] extended to age 6 in 2021.[128] In Europe this drug was approved in 2020 and marketed as Kaftrio.[129]  It is used in those who have a f508del mutation, found in about 90% of patients with cystic fibrosis.[126][130] According to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, \"this medicine represents the single greatest therapeutic advancement in the history of CF, offering a treatment for the underlying cause of the disease that could eventually bring modulator therapy to 90 percent of people with CF.\"[125] In a clinical trial, participants who were administered the combination drug experienced a subsequent 63% decrease in pulmonary exacerbations and a 41.8 mmol/L decrease in sweat chloride concentration.[131] By mitigating a repertoire of symptoms associated with cystic fibrosis, the combination drug significantly improved quality-of-life metrics among patients with the disease as well.[131][125] The combination drug is also known to interact with CYP3A inducers,[132] such as carbamazepine used in the treatment of bipolar disorder, causing elexacaftor/ivacaftor/tezacaftor to circulate in the body at decreased concentrations. As such, concurrent use is not recommended.[133] The list price in the US is going to be $311,000 per year;[134] however, insurance may cover much of the cost of the drug.[135]\nUrsodeoxycholic acid, a bile salt, has been used; however, a 2021 study aimed at evaluating whether the incidence of severe liver disease differed between CF centers routinely prescribing or not prescribing UDCA found no reduction in portal hypertension.[136]\nThe combination vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor (Alyftrek) was approved for medical use in the United States in December 2024.[137]\nIt is uncertain whether vitamin A or beta-carotene supplementation has any effect on eye and skin problems caused by vitamin A deficiency.[138]\nThere is no strong evidence that people with cystic fibrosis can prevent osteoporosis by increasing their intake of vitamin D.[139]\nFor people with vitamin E deficiency and cystic fibrosis, there is evidence that vitamin E supplementation may improve vitamin E levels, although it is still uncertain what effect supplementation has on vitamin E-specific deficiency disorders or on lung function.[140]\nRobust evidence regarding the effects of vitamin K supplementation in people with cystic fibrosis is lacking as of 2020.[141]\nVarious studies have examined the effects of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation for people with cystic fibrosis but the evidence is uncertain whether it has any benefits or adverse effects.[142]\nSeveral mechanical techniques are used to dislodge sputum and encourage its expectoration. One technique good for short-term airway clearance is chest physiotherapy where a respiratory therapist percusses an individual's chest by hand several times a day, to loosen up secretions. This \"percussive effect\" can be administered also through specific devices that use chest wall oscillation or intrapulmonary percussive ventilator. Other methods such as biphasic cuirass ventilation, and associated clearance mode available in such devices, integrate a cough assistance phase, as well as a vibration phase for dislodging secretions. These are portable and adapted for home use.[12]\nAnother technique is positive expiratory pressure physiotherapy which consists of providing back pressure to the airways during expiration. This effect is provided by devices that consist of a mask or a mouthpiece in which resistance is applied only during the expiration phase.[143] Operating principles of this technique seem to be the increase of gas pressure behind mucus through collateral ventilation along with a temporary increase in functional residual capacity preventing the early collapse of small airways during exhalation.[144][145]\nAs lung disease worsens, mechanical breathing support may become necessary. Individuals with CF may need to wear special masks at night to help push air into their lungs. These machines, known as bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) ventilators, help prevent low blood oxygen levels during sleep. Non-invasive ventilators may be used during physical therapy to improve sputum clearance.[146] It is not known if this type of therapy has an impact on pulmonary exacerbations or disease progression.[146] It is unknown what role non-invasive ventilation therapy has in improving exercise capacity in people with cystic fibrosis.[146] However, the authors noted that \"non-invasive ventilation may be a useful adjunct to other airway clearance techniques, particularly in people with cystic fibrosis who have difficulty expectorating sputum\".[147] During severe illness, a tube may be placed in the throat (a procedure known as a tracheostomy) to enable breathing supported by a ventilator.[148][149]\nFor children, preliminary studies show massage therapy may help people and their families' quality of life.[150]\nSome lung infections require surgical removal of the infected part of the lung. If this is necessary many times, lung function is severely reduced.[151] The most effective treatment options for people with CF who have spontaneous or recurrent pneumothoraces is not clear.[152]\nLung transplantation may become necessary for individuals with CF as lung function and exercise tolerance decline. Although single lung transplantation is possible in other diseases, individuals with CF must have both lungs replaced because the remaining lung might contain bacteria that could infect the transplanted lung. A pancreatic or liver transplant may be performed at the same time to alleviate liver disease and/or diabetes.[153] Lung transplantation is considered when lung function declines to the point where assistance from mechanical devices is required or survival is threatened.[154] According to Merck Manual, \"bilateral lung transplantation for severe lung disease is becoming more routine and more successful with experience and improved techniques. Among adults with CF, median survival posttransplant is about 9 years.\"[155]\nNewborns with intestinal obstruction typically require surgery, whereas adults with distal intestinal obstruction syndrome typically do not. Treatment of pancreatic insufficiency by replacement of missing digestive enzymes allows the duodenum to properly absorb nutrients and vitamins that would otherwise be lost in the feces. However, the best dosage and form of pancreatic enzyme replacement are unclear, as are the risks and long-term effectiveness of this treatment.[156]\nSo far, no large-scale research involving the incidence of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease in adults with cystic fibrosis has been conducted. This is likely because the vast majority of people with cystic fibrosis do not live long enough to develop clinically significant atherosclerosis or coronary heart disease.[157]\nDiabetes is the most common nonpulmonary complication of CF. It mixes features of type 1 and type 2 diabetes and is recognized as a distinct entity, cystic fibrosis-related diabetes.[41][158] While oral antidiabetic drugs are sometimes used, the recommended treatment is the use of insulin injections or an insulin pump,[159] and, unlike in type 1 and 2 diabetes, dietary restrictions are not recommended.[41] While Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is relatively common in people with cystic fibrosis, the evidence about the effectiveness of antibiotics for S. maltophilia is uncertain.[160]\nBisphosphonates taken by mouth or intravenously can be used to improve bone mineral density in people with cystic fibrosis, but there is no proof that this reduces fractures or increases survival rates.[161] When taking bisphosphates intravenously, adverse effects such as pain and flu-like symptoms can be an issue.[161] The adverse effects of bisphosphates taken by mouth on the gastrointestinal tract are unknown.[161]\nPoor growth may be avoided by insertion of a feeding tube for increasing food energy through supplemental feeds or by administration of injected growth hormone.[162]\nSinus infections are treated by prolonged courses of antibiotics. The development of nasal polyps or other chronic changes within the nasal passages may severely limit airflow through the nose, and over time reduce the person's sense of smell. Sinus surgery is often used to alleviate nasal obstruction and to limit further infections. Nasal steroids such as fluticasone propionate are used to decrease nasal inflammation.[163]\nFemale infertility may be overcome by assisted reproduction technology, particularly embryo transfer techniques. Male infertility caused by the absence of the vas deferens may be overcome with testicular sperm extraction, collecting sperm cells directly from the testicles. If the collected sample contains too few sperm cells to likely have spontaneous fertilization, intracytoplasmic sperm injection can be performed.[164] Third party reproduction is also a possibility for women with CF. Whether taking antioxidants affects outcomes is unclear.[165]\nPhysical exercise is usually part of outpatient care for people with cystic fibrosis.[166] Aerobic exercise seems to be beneficial for aerobic exercise capacity, lung function, and health-related quality of life; however, the quality of the evidence was poor.[166]\nDue to the use of aminoglycoside antibiotics, ototoxicity is common. Symptoms may include \"tinnitus, hearing loss, hyperacusis, aural fullness, dizziness, and vertigo\".[167]\nProblems with the gastrointestinal system including constipation and obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract including distal intestinal obstruction syndrome are frequent complications for people with cystic fibrosis.[35] Treatment of gastrointestinal problems is required in order to prevent a complete obstruction, reduce other CF symptoms, and improve the quality of life.[35] While stool softeners, laxatives, and prokinetics (GI-focused treatments) are often suggested, there is no clear consensus from experts as to which approach is the best and comes with the least risks.[35] Mucolytics or systemic treatments aimed at dysfunctional CFTR are also sometimes suggested to improve symptoms.[168] The evidence supporting these recommendations is very weak and more research is needed to understand how to prevent and treat GI problems in people with CF.[168] In addition, there is a risk of gastrointestinal malignancy, especially in the transplanted patient, and screening procedures may be considered at an earlier age.[169]",
    "Prognosis": "The prognosis for cystic fibrosis has improved due to earlier diagnosis through screening and better treatment and access to health care. In 1959, the median age of survival of children with CF in the United States was six months.[170]\nIn 2010, survival is estimated to be 37 years for women and 40 for men.[171] In Canada, median survival increased from 24 years in 1982 to 47.7 in 2007.[172] In the United States those born with CF in 2016 have a predicted life expectancy of 47.7 when cared for in specialty clinics.[173] Due to the recent development of new treatments, such as CFTR modulators, life expectancy has increased rapidly during recent years. In 2020 the median predicted life expectancy was around 59 years, although there are uncertainties in the estimates due to the low number of annual deaths for persons with cystic fibrosis.[174]\nIn the US, of those with CF who are more than 18 years old as of 2009, 92% had graduated from high school, 67% had at least some college education, 46% were in full-time or part-time employment, 56% were single, and 39% were married or living with a partner.[175]\nChronic illnesses can be difficult to manage. CF is a chronic illness that affects the \"digestive and respiratory tracts resulting in generalized malnutrition and chronic respiratory infections.\"[176] The thick secretions clog the airways in the lungs, which often cause inflammation and severe lung infections.[177][178] If it is compromised, it affects the quality of life of someone with CF and their ability to complete activities of daily living (ADLs).[179]\nAccording to Schmitz and Goldbeck (2006), CF significantly increases emotional stress on both the individual and the family, \"and the necessary time-consuming daily treatment routine may have further negative effects on quality of life\".[180] However, Havermans and colleagues (2006) have established that young outpatients with CF who have participated in the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised \"rated some quality of life domains higher than did their parents\".[181] Consequently, outpatients with CF have a more positive outlook for themselves. As Merck Manual notes, \"with appropriate support, most patients can make an age-appropriate adjustment at home and school. Despite myriad problems, the educational, occupational, and marital successes of patients are impressive.\"[155]\nFurthermore, there are many ways to enhance the quality of life in CF patients. Exercise is promoted to increase lung function. Integrating an exercise regimen into the CF patient's daily routine can significantly improve quality of life.[182] No definitive cure for CF is known, but diverse medications are used, such as mucolytics, bronchodilators, steroids, and antibiotics, that have the purpose of loosening mucus, expanding airways, decreasing inflammation, and fighting lung infections, respectively.[183]",
    "Epidemiology": "Cystic fibrosis is the most common life-limiting autosomal recessive disease among people of European heritage.[185] In the United States, about 30,000 individuals have CF; most are diagnosed by six months of age. In Canada, about 4,000 people have CF.[186] Around 1 in 25 people of European descent, and one in 30 of white Americans,[187] is a carrier of a CF mutation. Although CF is less common in these groups, roughly one in 46 Hispanics, one in 65 Africans, and one in 90 Asians carry at least one abnormal CFTR gene.[188][189] Ireland has the world's highest prevalence of CF, at one in 1353;[190] Japan's prevalence of CF is among the lowest in the world, at one in 350,000.[191]\nAlthough technically a rare disease, CF is ranked as one of the most widespread life-shortening genetic diseases. It is most common among nations in the Western world. An exception is Finland, where only one in 80 people carries a CF mutation.[192] The World Health Organization states, \"In the European Union, one in 2000–3000 newborns is found to be affected by CF\".[193] In the United States, one in 3,500 children is born with CF.[194] In 1997, about one in 3,300 white children in the United States was born with CF. In contrast, only one in 15,000 African American children have it, and in Asian Americans, the rate was even lower at one in 32,000.[195]\nCystic fibrosis is diagnosed equally in males and females. For reasons that remain unclear, data have shown that males tend to have a longer life expectancy than females,[196][197] though recent studies suggest this gender gap may no longer exist, perhaps due to improvements in health care facilities.[198][199] A recent study from Ireland identified a link between the female hormone estrogen and worse outcomes in CF.[200]\nThe distribution of CF alleles varies among populations. The frequency of ΔF508 carriers has been estimated at one in 200 in northern Sweden, one in 143 in Lithuanians, and one in 38 in Denmark. No ΔF508 carriers were found among 171 Finns and 151 Saami people.[201] ΔF508 does occur in Finland, but it is a minority allele there. CF is known to occur in only 20 families (pedigrees) in Finland.[202]\nThe ΔF508 mutation is estimated to have occurred up to 52,000 years ago.[203] Numerous hypotheses have been advanced as to why such a lethal allele has persisted and spread in the human population. Other common autosomal recessive diseases such as sickle-cell anemia have been found to protect carriers from other diseases, an evolutionary trade-off known as heterozygote advantage. Resistance to the following have all been proposed as possible sources of heterozygote advantage:"

    "Causes": "Although the genetic cause of Danon disease is known, the mechanism of the disease is not well understood. Danon disease involves a genetic defect (mutation) in a gene called LAMP2, which results in a change to the normal protein structure. While the function of the LAMP2 gene is not well understood, it is known that LAMP2 protein is primarily located in small structures within cells called lysosomes.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "Making a diagnosis for a genetic or rare disease can often be challenging. Healthcare professionals typically look at a person's medical history, symptoms, physical exam, and laboratory test results to make a diagnosis. The following resources provide information relating to diagnosis and testing for this condition. If you have questions about getting a diagnosis, you should contact a healthcare professional.[citation needed]\nTesting Resources\nThe Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests for this condition.

    "Disease": "Darier%27s disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Diagnosis of Darier disease is often made by the appearance of the skin and nails, family history, and/or genetic testing for the mutation in the ATP2A2 gene. However, many individuals are never diagnosed because of the mildness of their symptoms. Mild cases present clinically as minor rashes (without odor) that can become exacerbated by heat, humidity, stress, and sunlight.\nClinical symptoms  of the disease:[citation needed]\nOther less common or less noticed symptoms are:[6]",
    "Causes": "Skin changes in Darier's disease are related to a type of nutritional vitamin A deficiency that is caused by genetic mutations (that is, DD is a systemic Vitamin A deficiency). The skin displays follicular dyskeratosis (degeneration of the skin in hair follicules), which reflects as hypovitaminosis A.[15] The skin reactions are caused by an abnormality in the desmosome-keratin filament complex leading to a breakdown in cell adhesion.[16][5]\nMutations in a single gene, ATP2A2, are the ultimate cause for the development of Darier's disease. It is an autosomal dominant disorder, that is, if one parent has DD, there is a 50% chance than a child will inherit DD.[a]\nSubtypes of DD have been preliminarily suggested. A large number of mutant alleles of ATP2A2 have been identified in association with Darier's Disease. One study of 19 families and 6 sporadic cases found 24 specific, novel mutations associated with DD symptoms. This study reported a loose, imperfect correlation between the severity of ATP2A2 mutations with the severity of the condition. Significant variability in disease severity between members of the same family carrying the same mutation was also reported by this study, suggesting that genetic modifiers contribute to the phenotypic penetrance of certain mutations.[20]\nOne subtype is linear Darier's disease. These cases result from somatic mutations to ATP2A2 in epidermal stem cells. Such individuals display phenotypic mosaicism, where the Darier's phenotype only affects the subset of epidermal tissue arising from the mutated progenitor cell.  Somatic mutations are not inherited by the offspring of such individuals.[21]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis of Darier disease is often made by the appearance of the skin and nails, family history, and/or genetic testing for the mutation in the ATP2A2 gene. However, many individuals are never diagnosed because of the mildness of their symptoms. Mild cases present clinically as minor rashes (without odor) that can become exacerbated by heat, humidity, stress, and sunlight.\nClinical symptoms  of the disease:[citation needed]\nOther less common or less noticed symptoms are:[6]",
    "Treatment": "Two recent reviews of the medical literature have evaluated treatment strategies for DD.  Management and treatment of Darier disease depends on the severity of the presented clinical symptoms. Mild symptoms are often treated with moisturising creams, and more severe symptoms with topical and oral retinol or other medications (oral medications having higher strength than topical equivalents), and medical procedures.[22][23]\nIn many mild cases, DD can be managed by avoiding excessive perspiration and non-breathable and abrasive clothing (producing contact dermatitis), washing with salty water, and gentle abrasion with a gauze pad. This is supplemented by moisturising lotions and topical sunscreens. Most patients with Darier's disease can live normal healthy lives.\nIn more severe cases of DD, application of topical and oral medications, particularly retinoids, is prescribed. Hospitalisation may be required for seriously affected individuals who display frequent relapse and remit patterns and severe infections.\nRapid resolution of rash symptoms can be complicated by the increased vulnerability of affected skin surfaces to secondary bacterial or viral infections. Bacterial overgrowth can produce an odour. The main bacteria is epidermal Staphylococcus aureus. The main viruses are human papillomavirus (HPV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV). Infections are treated with antibiotics (for bacteria) and antiviral medications (for viruses).[citation needed]\nTreatments that have evidence-based support (though not for all persons treated) can be classified into a number of groups.[22] Because DD is a product of systemic Vitamin A deficiency, retinoids, chemical compounds (molecules) that are forms of (or related to) Vitamin A, are often recommended. Vitamin A acid compounds are often preferred as being less toxic than Vitamin A itself.[15]\n1. Topical medications: Retinoids (Adapalene, Tretinoin, Isotretinoin, Tazarotene gel). Topical retinoids help in the reduction of hyperkeratosis. They work by causing the skin cells in the top layers to die and be shed off.\n2. Other topical medications.\n3. Oral medications: Retinoids (Acitretin, Isotretinoin). If symptoms are severe, oral retinoids have been proven to be very effective. However, there can be many adverse (and sometimes serious) side-effects associated with prolonged use.[22]\n4. Medical Procedures: Surgical excision and dermabrasion, laser procedures, radiation procedures (grenz-ray, X-ray, radiology).",
    "Epidemiology": "Worldwide prevalence of DD is estimated as between 1:30,000 and 1:100,000.  Case studies have shown estimated prevalence by country to be 3.8:100,000 in Slovenia,[8] 1:36,000 in north-east England,[9] 1:30,000 in Scotland,[10] and 1:100,000 in Denmark.[11]\nDD is seen in males and females equally. Symptoms typically arise between the ages of about 15 and 30, and vary over the lifetime in a relapse and remit pattern, in particular flareups that need to be managed. DD is inherited (genetic), and in particular can be traced in family groups in specific geographic localities.\nDarier's disease is a non-communicable disorder, but secondary infections by bacteria and viruses can be spread to others.\nDD was initially identified and studied by dermatologists (skin specialists) as a purely skin disease. Recent research however suggests DD has a whole-body effect, including cognitive and mental health issues.[12]\nA study of 100 British individuals diagnosed with Darier's disease reported that affected individuals display elevated frequencies of neuropsychiatric conditions. They had high lifetime rates for mood disorders (50%), including depression (30%), bipolar disorder (4%), suicidal thoughts (31%), and suicide attempts (13%).[12]\nA Swedish study of 770 individuals with DD showed a six-fold risk of being diagnosed with an intellectual disability, compared to matched Swedish population controls.[13]\nA study of 76 DD patients found that 41% reported learning difficulties, notably reading difficulties, and 74% reported a family history of learning disabilities.[14] The full range of learning difficulties is not known."

    "Disease": "Degos disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The characteristic symptom of Degos disease is the development of papules. Initially, individuals may have skin lesions or rashes, but they will proceed to develop distinct bumps, or papules.[4] Papules are circular in shape, have a porcelain-white center and red border. As papules age, the white centers will sink in and only the border will remain raised. Typically, papules range from 0.5 to 1 cm in width. Papules appear on the trunk and upper extremities and are not found on the individual's palms, soles, scalp, or face.[1]\nSymptoms vary, depending on whether an individual has the benign variant or malignant variant of the disease. Both the benign and malignant forms have development of the characteristic papules. Individuals with the benign form will have the typical papules persisting anywhere from a few years to throughout their whole lives. In the benign form, no inner organs are affected. If an individual develops the malignant form, it means that not only are the papules present, but inner organs are involved. Most malignant cases involve problems of the gastrointestinal tract leading to small intestine lesions, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bowel perforation. If the central nervous system is involved, symptoms can include headaches, dizziness, seizures, paralysis of cranial nerves, weakness, stroke, damage to small areas of the brain due to artery blockage (cerebral infarcts, and cerebral hemorrhage). Additional organs commonly impacted include the heart, lungs, and kidneys. Symptoms that may develop from damage to these organs include double vision (diplopia), clouding of lenses of eyes, swelling of the optic disc (papilledema), partial loss of vision, shortness of breath, chest pain, epilepsy, and thickening of pericardium.[3][4]\nSomeone with the benign form may suddenly develop symptoms of the malignant form.[1] Symptoms can last anywhere from a few weeks to several years. Onset of symptoms typically begins to manifest between the ages of 20–50.[5] A few cases of this condition in newborns have also been described.[6]",
    "Causes": "The papules characteristic for this disease develop due to infarctions, or blockages in small-medium arteries and veins. The underlying cause is unknown for this disease.[1] Though not confirmed, some cases have shown signs of inheritance between first-degree relatives. It has been suggested that the disease has a familial inheritance pattern; it is thought to be an autosomal dominant disorder. In most cases of familial inheritance, the benign variant of the disease has been present.[4][7][8]\nDue to the lack of knowledge of the pathomechanism for this condition prevention strategies are not known. However, in order to prevent worsening of symptoms, consistent evaluations should be conducted by a physician.[1]",
    "Diagnosis": "Clinical evaluation and identification of characteristics papules may allow a dermatologist to diagnose Degos disease.[4] The papules have a white center and are bordered with a red ring. After lesions begin to appear, the diagnosis for Degos disease can be supported by histological findings. Most cases will show a wedge-shaped connective tissue necrosis in the deep corium. This shape is due to the blockage/occlusion of small arteries.[1]\nIndividuals may be diagnosed with the benign form if only the papules are present. However, an individual may be diagnosed with the malignant form if involvement of other organs like the lungs, intestine and/or central nervous system occurs. The malignant, or systematic form of this condition may suddenly develop even after having papules present for several years. In order to quickly diagnose this shift to the malignant variant of the disease, it is important for individuals to have consistent follow-up evaluations. In these evaluations, depending on which organs are suspected to be involved, the following procedures and tests may be conducted: skin inspection, brain magnetic resonance tomography, colonoscopy, chest X-ray, and/or abdominal ultrasound.[1]",
    "Treatment": "Due to the lack of knowledge around the underlying mechanism of malignant atrophic papulosis, an effective treatment method has not been developed.[1] Treatment for this condition is symptomatic.[4] However, several treatment methods have been tested and are still being developed as more information regarding the condition is found. Fibrinolytic and immunosuppressive therapeutic regimens were tested and found to be mostly unsuccessful as treatment methods.[1][8]\nAfter treating conditions comorbid with Degos disease, physicians have recently found improvement in symptoms with the use of eculizumab and treprostinil.[9][10] Discovered by dermatopathologist, Cynthia Magro, response to eculizumab is often immediate and dramatic, but has been of limited duration and is expensive, needing to be infused every 14 days.[9] Treprostinil use has been reported to result in clearing of gastrointestinal and central nervous system findings as well as clearing of cutaneous lesions, but reports are limited. Treprostinil may be more effective than other vasodilators because it may also increase the population of circulating endothelial cells, allowing angiogenesis.[1]"

    "Disease": "Dejerine%E2%80%93Sottas disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Onset occurs in infancy or early childhood, usually before three years of age. Progression is slow until the teenage years at which point it may accelerate, resulting in severe disability.[1]\nSymptoms are more severe and rapidly progressive than in the other more common Charcot–Marie–Tooth diseases. Some patients may never walk and will be reliant on wheelchair use by the end of their first decade, while others may need only a cane, crutches, or similar support through most of their lives, but this is rare.[1]\nDejerine–Sottas disease is characterized by moderate to severe lower and upper extremity weakness and loss of sensation, mainly in the lower legs, forearms, feet, and hands. Loss of muscle mass and reduced muscle tone usually occur as the disease progresses. Other symptoms may include pain in the extremities, curvature of the spine, clawed hands, foot deformities, ataxia, peripheral areflexia, and slow acquisition of motor skills in childhood. Symptoms that are less common can include limitation of eye movements, other eye problems such as nystagmus or anisocoria, or moderate to severe hearing loss.[2]",
    "Causes": "Dejerine–Sottas neuropathy is caused by a genetic defect either in the proteins found in axons or the proteins found in myelin.[2] Specifically, it has been associated with mutations in MPZ,[6] PMP22,[7] PRX,[8] and EGR2[9] genes. The disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner.[2]",
    "Diagnosis": "On medical imaging, the peripheral and cranial nerves are enlarged by redundant connective tissue. On histology, this enlargement gives the nerves the appearance of an onion-bulb. Nerve excitability and conduction speed are reduced.[1]",
    "Treatment": "Management is symptomatic for this condition.[10]"

    "Disease": "Dercum%27s disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Four cardinal symptoms have sometimes been used as diagnostic criteria:[citation needed]\nOther potential signs of the disease include:[citation needed]\nHowever, as it is unclear which symptoms are cardinal and which symptoms are minor signs in Dercum's disease, it is unclear which should be used as diagnostic criteria. Researchers have proposed a 'minimal definition' based on symptoms most often part of Dercum's disease: 1) Generalized overweight or obesity. 2) Chronic pain in the adipose tissue.[4] The associated symptoms in Dercum's disease include obesity, fatty deposits, easy bruisability, sleep disturbances, impaired memory, depression, difficulty concentrating, anxiety, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, diabetes, bloating, constipation, fatigue, weakness, and joint and muscle aches.[7] Regarding the associated symptoms in Dercum's disease, only case reports have been published. No study involving medical examinations has been performed in a large group of patients.[4]",
    "Causes": "There are no currently known causes of this disease. There are studies currently proposing several theories of the causes which include inflammation of the adipose tissue, nervous system malfunction and endocrine malfunction. None of the theories that are currently proposed have been found viable. Since little is known about Dercum's disease, there are currently no known modes of prevention.[8]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis of Dercum's disease is done through a physical examination. In order to properly diagnose the patient, the doctor must first exclude all other possible differential diagnoses. The basic criteria for Dercum's disease are patients with chronic pain in the adipose tissue (body fat) and patients who are also obese. Although rare, the diagnosis may not include obesity.[4] Dercum's disease can also be inherited and a family medical history may aid in the diagnosis of this disease.[4] There are no specific laboratory test for this disease. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging can play a role in diagnosis.[9]",
    "Treatment": "Common treatments for Dercum's disease is directed towards treating the individual symptoms. Pain relief medication may be administered to temporarily reduce the discomfort in the patient. Cortisone shots have also been shown to be effective in temporarily reducing the chronic pain. Surgical removal of the damaged adipose tissue can be effective, but often the disease will recur.[10]\nFew convincing large studies on the treatment of Dercum's disease have been conducted. Most of the different treatment strategies that exist are based on case reports. [4] Currently, there is a lack of scientific data on the use of integrative therapies for the treatment or prevention of Dercum's disease. Not enough studies have been done to substantiate that diet and supplements could help with the disease.[citation needed]\nSurgical excision of fatty tissue deposits around joints (liposuction) has been used in some cases. Liposuction may temporarily relieve symptoms although recurrences often develop.[11]\nTraditional analgesics\nThe pain in Dercum's disease is often reported to be refractory to analgesics and to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, this has been contradicted by the findings of Herbst et al. They reported that the pain diminished in 89% of patients (n=89) when treated with NSAIDs and in 97% of patients when treated with narcotic analgesics (n=37). The dosage required and the duration of the pain relief are not precisely stated in the article.[citation needed]\nAn early report from 1934 showed that intralesional injections of procaine (Novocain) relieved pain in six cases. More recently, other types of local treatment of painful sites with lidocaine patches (5%) (Lidoderm) or lidocaine/prilocaine (25 mg/25 mg) cream (EMLA®) have shown a reduction of pain in a few cases.[4]\nIn the 1980s, treatment with intravenous infusions of lidocaine (Xylocaine) in varying doses was reported in nine patients. The resulting pain relief lasted from 10 hours to 12 months. In five of the cases, the lidocaine treatment was combined with mexiletine (Mexitil®), which is a class 1B anti-arrhythmic with similar pharmacological properties as lidocaine.\nThe mechanism by which lidocaine reduces pain in Dercum's disease is unclear. It may block impulse conduction in peripheral nerves, and thereby disconnect abnormal nervous impulse circuits. Nonetheless, it might also depress cerebral activity that could lead to increased pain thresholds. Iwane et al. performed an EEG during the administration of intravenous lidocaine. The EEG showed slow waves appearing 7 minutes after the start of the infusion and disappearing within 20 minutes after the end of the infusion. On the other hand, the pain relief effect was the greatest at about 20 minutes after the end of the infusion.[4]\nBased on this, the authors concluded that the effect of lidocaine on peripheral nerves most likely explains why the drug has an effect on pain in Dercum's disease. In contrast, Atkinson et al. have suggested that an effect on the central nervous system is more likely, as lidocaine can depress consciousness and decrease cerebral metabolism. In addition, Skagen et al. demonstrated that a patient with Dercum's disease lacked the vasoconstrictor response to arm and leg lowering, which indicated that the sympathicusmediated local veno-arteriolar reflex was absent. This could suggest increased sympathetic activity. An infusion of lidocaine increased blood flow in subcutaneous tissue and normalised the vasoconstrictor response when the limbs were lowered. The authors suggested that the pain relief was caused by a normalisation of up-regulated sympathetic activity.[4]\nOne patient's symptoms were improved with methotrexate and infliximab. However, in another patient with Dercum's disease, the effect of methotrexate was discreet. The mechanism of action is unclear. Previously, methotrexate has been shown to reduce neuropathic pain caused by peripheral nerve injury in a study on rats. The mechanism in the rat study case was thought to be a decrease in microglial activation subsequent to nerve injury. Furthermore, a study has shown that infliximab reduces neuropathic pain in patients with central nervous system sarcoidosis. The mechanism is thought to be mediated by tumour necrosis factor inhibition.[4]\nTwo patients were successfully treated with interferon α-2b. The authors speculated on whether the mechanism could be the antiviral effect of the drug, the production of endogenous substances, such as endorphins, or interference with the production of interleukin-1 and tumour necrosis factor. Interleukin-1 and tumour necrosis factor are involved in cutaneous hyperalgesia.[4]\nA few patients noted some improvement when treated with systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisolone), whereas others experienced worsening of the pain. Weinberg et al. treated two patients with juxta-articular Dercum's disease with intralesional injections of methylprednisolone (Depo-Medrol). The patients experienced a dramatic improvement.\nThe mechanism for the pain-reducing ability of corticosteroids in some conditions is unknown. One theory is that they inhibit the effects of substances such as histamine, serotonin, bradykinin, and prostaglandins. As the aetiology of Dercum's disease is probably not inflammatory, it is plausible that the improvement some of the patients experience when using corticosteroids is not caused by an anti-inflammatory effect.[4]\nCVAC sessions\nCyclic Variations in Adaptive Conditioning (CVAC) is a method of touch-free cyclic hypobaric pneumatic compression for treatment of tissue edema and, therefore, edema-associated pain. As a pilot study, 10 participants with AD completed pain and quality of life questionnaires before and after 20–40 minutes of CVAC process daily for 5 days. After treatment, there was a significant decrease in pain as measured by the Pain Catastrophizing Scale and the Visual Analogue Scale, but there was no change in pain quality by the McGill Pain Questionnaire. However, there were no changes in the Pain Disability Index or Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. This study suggests a potential treatment role for CVAC, and the authors recommended randomized controlled clinical trials.[12][13]",
    "Epidemiology": "Dercum's disease most commonly appears between the ages of 35 and 50 years of age.[4] It is five to thirty times more common in women than in men.[4] Originally, Dercum proposed that the condition mainly affects postmenopausal women. However, a 2007 survey has revealed that 85.7 percent of the included patients developed Dercum's disease before menopause.[4] The prevalence of Dercum's disease has not yet been exactly established.[4]"

    "Disease": "Dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Symptoms include lack of sweat glands, thin hair, brittle nails, mottled skin, and lack of fingerprints.[6] It is also characterized by a widespread, early-onset reticulate hyperpigmentation.[7] Those affected may also have adermatoglyphia, abnormal epithelial differentiation, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles, acral dorsal blistering, as well as hypohidrosis or hyperhidrosis.[7][8][5]\nDPR is very similar to the related Naegeli-Franceschetti-Jadassohn syndrome (NFJS). Both cause an affected person to lack fingerprints, as well as present a lace-like pattern of hyperpigmentation and hyperkeratosis of the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. DPR is distinguished from NFJS by the duration of hyperpigmentation and lack of dental abnormalities.[9] Since these differences are very slight and relatively minimal, researchers recommend that NFJS and DPR be considered a single disorder.[5]",
    "Causes": "The disease interval for DPR was found to harbor 230 genes associated with the condition.[10] DPR and NFJS syndromes were specifically found to be differentiated from other syndromes by a mutation of the keratin 14 gene,[5] located on chromosome 17q21.2.[11] This was found when keratin genes KRT14, KRT16, and KRT17 were reassessed in 2006, revealing pathogenic mutations of KRT14 in all patients with NFJS/DPR, displaying a strong correlation and suggesting a potential causation.[5] The type of mutations observed were heterozygous nonsense or frameshift mutations,[10] meaning the function of the gene was completely disrupted (missense is correlated with EBS).[5] The different phenotypic presentations of recessive (EBS-causing) versus dominant (NFJS/DPR-causing) premature truncation mutations in KRT14 are still unclear.[5] The NFJS/DPR mutations were verified using two screening approaches, in which it was found that 17delG was absent from a panel of 100 control individuals, and C18X and Q7X were found to create a novel recognition site for the endonucleases DdeI and BfaI.[5] Because the mutations were found to be heterozygous, the condition was concluded to be autosomal dominant in its inheritance pattern.[5]\nInterestingly, a study conducted on five families using a two-point linkage analysis of the combined genotyping data for three families across the NFJS/DPR candidate region generated an LOD score of 6.2 at marker D17S800, with a recombination score of 0.[5] Further analysis revealed that NFJS may be caused by an identical founder mutation located within a 6-Mb interval between D17S946 and D17S2180.[5]\nThe disruption of the KRT14 gene in DPR suggests this gene is important during the early development of dermatoglyphics and sweat glands.[10] Because of the aforementioned genetic similarity between NFJS and DPR, some researchers have suggested treating the disorders as a single condition.[10]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis of DPR begins with review of a patient's medical history, laboratory results, and clinical examination of symptoms. Biopsy and histopathological examination can be used to test for the presence of hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, follicular plugging, and basal cell melanization, all indicators of DPR. Furthermore, abnormalities in skin pigmentation patterns as well as the presence of palmoplantar keratoderma with yellow tinting of the skin can indicate a possible case of DPR.[12] Despite the presence of outward indicators, routine blood testing will not yield abnormal results.\nWhile the aforementioned symptoms of DPR are outwardly identifiable, DPR is a rare genetic disease that requires genetic analysis to yield a confirmed diagnosis.[13]\nThe Genetic Testing Registry lists 15 clinical genetic tests used in obtaining a diagnosis of this disorder. Two of these tests utilize Targeted Variant Analysis, thirteen utilize sequence analysis of the entire coding region, and seven utilize deletion and duplication analysis.[7] The type of test ordered may depend on the clinician's judgement or access to specific testing methods.",
    "Treatment": "To date, there is no medical treatment specific to DPR, however symptom management of palmoplantar hyperkeratosis as well as other, secondary symptoms is possible through the use of topical steroids, keratolytics, and emollients. Furthermore, cold compresses can be used to treat blistering.[14]",
    "Epidemiology": "Since first being reported, only 12 cases of DPR have been described and diagnosed.[15] Many studies and diagnoses have come from the same family, but a single case report was found in India.[5][16] In a study conducted by Lugassy et al., the five families being studied were from geographically different places: one family, for example was Swiss, another was from the United States, and a third was from the United Kingdom.[5]"

    "Disease": "Diabetes insipidus",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Excessive urination and extreme thirst and increased fluid intake (especially for cold water and sometimes ice or ice water) are typical for DI.[7] The symptoms of excessive urination and extreme thirst are similar to what is seen in untreated diabetes mellitus, with the distinction that the urine does not contain glucose. Blurred vision is a rarity. Signs of dehydration may also appear in some individuals since the body cannot properly regulate the amount of the water it takes in.[8]\nExtreme urination continues throughout the day and the night. In children, DI can interfere with appetite, eating, weight gain and growth, as well. They may present with fever, vomiting or diarrhea. Adults with untreated DI may remain healthy for decades as long as enough water is consumed to offset the urinary losses. However, there is a continuous risk of dehydration and loss of potassium that may lead to hypokalemia.[9][10]",
    "Causes": "The several forms of diabetes insipidus are:",
    "Diagnosis": "To distinguish DI from other causes of excess urination, blood glucose levels, bicarbonate levels, and calcium levels need to be tested. Measurement of blood electrolytes can reveal a high sodium level (hypernatremia as dehydration develops). Urinalysis demonstrates a dilute urine with a low specific gravity. Urine osmolarity and electrolyte levels are typically low.[32]\nA fluid deprivation test is another way of distinguishing DI from other causes of excessive urination.[33] If there is no change in fluid loss, giving desmopressin can determine if DI is caused by:[34]\nThis test measures the changes in body weight, urine output, and urine composition when fluids are withheld to induce dehydration. The body's normal response to dehydration is to conserve water by concentrating the urine. Those with DI continue to urinate large amounts of dilute urine in spite of water deprivation. In primary polydipsia, the urine osmolality should increase and stabilize at above 280 mOsm/kg with fluid restriction, while a stabilization at a lower level indicates diabetes insipidus.[35] Stabilization in this test means, more specifically, when the increase in urine osmolality is less than 30 Osm/kg per hour for at least three hours.[35] Sometimes measuring blood levels of ADH toward the end of this test is also necessary, but is more time-consuming to perform.[35]\nTo distinguish between the main forms, desmopressin stimulation is also used; desmopressin can be taken by injection, a nasal spray, or a tablet. While taking desmopressin, a person should drink fluids or water only when thirsty and not at other times, as this can lead to sudden fluid accumulation in the central nervous system. If desmopressin reduces urine output and increases urine osmolarity, the hypothalamic production of ADH is deficient, and the kidney responds normally to exogenous vasopressin (desmopressin). If the DI is due to kidney pathology, desmopressin does not change either urine output or osmolarity (since the endogenous vasopressin levels are already high).[34][36]\nWhilst diabetes insipidus usually occurs with polydipsia, it can also rarely occur not only in the absence of polydipsia but in the presence of its opposite, adipsia (or hypodipsia). \"Adipsic diabetes insipidus\" is recognised[37] as a marked absence of thirst even in response to hyperosmolality.[38] In some cases of adipsic DI, the person may also fail to respond to desmopressin.[39]\nIf central DI is suspected, testing of other hormones of the pituitary, as well as magnetic resonance imaging, particularly a pituitary MRI, is necessary to discover if a disease process (such as a prolactinoma, or histiocytosis, syphilis, tuberculosis or other tumor or granuloma) is affecting pituitary function. Most people with this form have either experienced past head trauma or have stopped ADH production for an unknown reason.[12]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment involves drinking sufficient fluids to prevent dehydration.[1] Other treatments depend on the type.[1] In central and gestational DI treatment is with desmopressin.[1] Nephrogenic DI may be treated by addressing the underlying cause or the use of a thiazide, aspirin, or ibuprofen.[1]\nCentral DI and gestational DI respond to desmopressin which is given as intranasal or oral tablets. Carbamazepine, an anticonvulsive medication, has also had some success in this type of DI.[40] Also, gestational DI tends to abate on its own in four to six weeks following labor, though some women may develop it again in subsequent pregnancies. In dipsogenic DI, desmopressin is not usually an option.[34][41]\nDesmopressin will be ineffective in nephrogenic DI which is treated by reversing the underlying cause (if possible) and replacing the free water deficit. A thiazide diuretic, such as chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide, can be used to create mild hypovolemia which encourages salt and water uptake in proximal tubule and thus improve nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.[42] Amiloride has additional benefit of blocking Na uptake. Thiazide diuretics are sometimes combined with amiloride to prevent hypokalemia caused by the thiazides. It seems paradoxical to treat an extreme diuresis with a diuretic, and the exact mechanism of action is unknown but the thiazide diuretics will decrease distal convoluted tubule reabsorption of sodium and water, thereby causing diuresis. This decreases plasma volume, thus lowering the glomerular filtration rate and enhancing the absorption of sodium and water in the proximal nephron. Less fluid reaches the distal nephron, so overall fluid conservation is obtained.[43]\nLithium-induced nephrogenic DI may be effectively managed with the administration of amiloride, a potassium-sparing diuretic often used in conjunction with thiazide or loop diuretics. Clinicians have been aware of lithium toxicity for many years, and traditionally have administered thiazide diuretics for lithium-induced polyuria and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. However, amiloride has recently been shown to be a successful treatment for this condition.[44]"

    "Disease": "Diffuse infantile fibromatosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The severity of infantile fibromatosis can vary. Although infantile fibromatosis tumors are benign, these tumors can grow in large masses and damage organs as they expand.[6] Some early signs and symptoms can be observed in the early stage of infancy (90% of cases are observed in children under two years of age). Infantile fibromatosis can be categorized by lesions are that are firm and non-tender, and skin that may be purple or red in color and appears ulcerated and crusted.\nAccording to the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD), infantile myofibromatosis can be categorized into different forms. The most common form of infantile myofibromatosis is known as the solitary form. This is mostly found in males around the head, neck or trunk areas. While the lesions are mostly seen on the surface of the skin, they can also extend into the subcutaneous tissue and/or muscle tissue. The second form of infantile myofibromatosis is called the multicentric form without visceral involvement. This form is more commonly found in females, and is characterized by multiple nodules that can occur on the skin, subcutaneous tissue and/or muscle. The most severe form of infantile myofibromatosis, however, is known as the multicentric form with visceral involvement because many organs are typically involved and the growth of the lesion is widespread. This can be categorized as having multiple growths of the skin, muscles, and even internal organs or structures such as the bones, lung, heart, and the GI tract. In this form, life-threatening complications can arise.[3][7]",
    "Causes": "For the majority of cases, infantile myofibromatosis (IM) manifests spontaneously without a known cause. Rarely, multiple family members present with the disorder. In these instances, mutations/variants in the PDGFRB and NOTCH3 genes have been identified as causative.[3]  In familial cases of IM, a mutation in the PDGFRB gene was discovered in 18/19 families .[8] Mutations in the NOTCH3 are less common, to date only one family with IM has been identified to have the mutation.[9]\nThese mutations are caused by errors in DNA replication and they can be either germline or somatic.[10] Germline mutations occur in sperm or egg cells meaning that the mutation can be passed down to future generations. While somatic mutations occur after fertilization during a time of rapid cell division and development. Somatic mutations cannot be passed down to offspring because they do not occur in germ cells (sperm and egg).[10][11]\nEveryone inherits two copies of the same gene, one from either parent. Mutations in one copy or both copies of the gene may result in the development of a disease or disorder. IM may present as either an autosomal dominant or recessive disorder. Autosomal mutations are those not occurring in the X and Y chromosomes. Autosomal dominant disorders are those in which a mutation in one gene is needed for the disorder to manifest, while autosomal recessive disorders need both genes to carry the mutation. IM acts as an autosomal dominant disorder when there is either a germline or somatic mutation in one copy of the PDGFRB gene.[10]  In rare cases, IM manifests as an autosomal recessive disorder in individuals who have inherited two mutated NOTCH3 genes.[9]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis of diffuse infantile myofibromatosis requires microscopic tissue examination as well as a physical examination of the individual.[3] Tumor growth is monitored using imaging software like ultrasound and MRI to visualize the tumor progression, regression, and can be useful in diagnosing recurrence of a tumor. The imaging software allows surgeons to pinpoint the location of the tumors and the extent of the lesions to properly evaluate the size.\nIn order to diagnose infantile myofibromatosis, a tissue sample must be removed from the tumor and be identified as infantile myofibromatosis as opposed to other growths that may look similar in imaging.[3] In a case study in a 15-month-old diagnosed with diffuse infantile fibromatosis, the lesion tissue extracted from the infant's thigh had a salt-and-pepper appearance.[2] By the looks of the tissue, there was swelling due to the increased presence of inflammatory cells, lymphoid follicles (dense tissue), increased capillaries, and some fat cells.[2] Blood draws can be used to genetically test for and diagnose infantile myofibromatosis while also providing more details on potential causes (such as specific genes) and assessing the risk of infantile myofibromatosis in future pregnancies.[3]\nGenetic testing can identify the likelihood of getting the disease.[3] It identifies if the individual is susceptible by screening for the PDGFRB and NOTCH3 gene, which are the causes of infantile fibromatosis.[9] If a child is diagnosed with diffuse infantile fibromatosis, it is recommended for parents and siblings to be tested as well to calculated the risk of conceiving another child with the same gene.[3]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment for diffuse infantile fibromatosis is individualized and depends on the type of treatment that is most appropriate for the type, location, and size of the tumor. There are currently no guidelines for treatment due to how rare this disease is and treatment for individuals with the disease was decided on a case-by-case basis. Sometimes, these infantile lesions are untreated in hopes of a spontaneous remission, which means the lesion heals without any interventions or treatment.[3]\nWhile the tumor may grow slowly (or even shrink over time) and not require any intervention, surgery is the most direct treatment option to remove the tumor to prevent organ damage. As the tumor expands and grows bigger in size, it can lead to life-threatening complications and damage to organs, such as the bones, heart, and lungs.\nIn cases involving vital organs or progression towards vital organs, surgery is highly recommended to avoid further complications and improve the prognosis.[3]\nAnother treatment option is chemotherapy; it is recommended when surgery is not an viable treatment option.[6] However, in the study \"Clinical utility of vinblastine therapeutic drug monitoring for the treatment of infantile myofibroma patients: A case series\", the pharmacokinetic parameters of vinblastine (a chemotherapy medication) were studied among four infants with the age ranging between 3–3.5 weeks at the first dose of vinblastine. The study states that chemotherapy dose adjustment for infants is extremely difficult mainly due to the lack of age-specific pharmacokinetic data sets, and further study needs to be performed in order to establish an evidence-based dosing guidelines for infants.[14]\nSome affected children where surgery could not be performed for any reason or where progression was rapid were successfully treated with a combination of methotrexate and vinblastine.[3]",
    "Prognosis": "There is a relatively good prognosis for solitary and multicentric myofibromatosis without visceral involvement. This is due to the spontaneous regression of tumors, which generally occurs within 18 to 24 months after diagnosis.[15][16][13]  In multicentric myofibromatosis with visceral involvement, multiple organs can be affected, resulting in a high rate of mortality for these individuals.[16] Published cohorts of 28 to 31 children with multicentric myofibromatosis with visceral involvement reported mortality rates of 76–93%. The high rates were mostly attributed to cardiopulmonary and gastrointestinal complications.[13]",
    "Epidemiology": "This disorder affects less than 3,000 children in the United States.[3] Infantile fibromatosis is found to affect 1 out of 150,000 babies, commonly under the age of 2 years; however, the statistics for diffused infantile fibromatosis are unknown due to the rare nature of the disease.[6]"

    "Disease": "Diffuse panbronchiolitis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Symptoms of DPB include chronic sinusitis (inflamed paranasal sinuses), wheezing, crackles (respiratory sounds made by obstructions such as phlegm and secretions in the lungs), dyspnea (shortness of breath), and a severe cough that yields large amounts of sputum (coughed-up phlegm). There may be pus in the sputum, and affected individuals may have fever. Typical signs of DPB progression include dilation (enlargement) of the bronchiolar passages and hypoxemia (low levels of oxygen in the blood). If DPB is left untreated, bronchiectasis will occur; it is characterized by dilation and thickening of the walls of the bronchioles, inflammatory damage to respiratory and terminal bronchioles, and pooling of mucus in the lungs.[4][5] DPB is associated with progressive respiratory failure, hypercapnia (increased levels of carbon dioxide in the blood), and can eventually lead to pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the pulmonary vein and artery) and cor pulmonale (dilation of the right ventricle of the heart, or \"right heart failure\").[6][7]",
    "Causes": "DPB is idiopathic, which means an exact physiological, environmental, or pathogenic cause of the disease is unknown. However, several factors are suspected to be involved with its pathogenesis (the way in which the disease works).[4]\nThe major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a large genomic region found in most vertebrates that is associated with the immune system. It is located on chromosome 6 in humans. A subset of MHC in humans is human leukocyte antigen (HLA), which controls the antigen-presenting system, as part of adaptive immunity against pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. When human cells are infected by a pathogen, some of them can present parts of the pathogen's proteins on their surfaces; this is called \"antigen presentation\". The infected cells then become targets for types of cytotoxic T-cells, which kill the infected cells so they can be removed from the body.[8]\nGenetic predisposition for DPB susceptibility has been localized to two HLA haplotypes (a nucleotide or gene sequence difference between paired chromosomes, that is more likely to occur among a common ethnicity or trait) common to people of East Asian descent. HLA-B54 is associated with DPB in the Japanese, while HLA-A11 is associated with the disease in Koreans.[9] Several genes within this region of class I HLA are believed to be responsible for DPB, by allowing increased susceptibility to the disease.[7][10] The common genetic background and similarities in the HLA profile of affected Japanese and Korean individuals were considered in the search for a DPB gene.[10] It was suggested that a mutation of a suspected disease-susceptibility gene located somewhere between HLA-B[11] and HLA-A[12] had occurred on an ancestral chromosome carrying both HLA-B54 and HLA-A11. Further, it is possible that a number of genetic recombination events around the disease locus (location on a chromosome) could have resulted in the disease being associated with HLA-B54 in the Japanese and HLA-A11 in Koreans. After further study, it was concluded that a DPB susceptibility gene is located near the HLA-B locus at chromosome 6p21.3. Within this area, the search for a genetic cause of the disease has continued.[9][10]\nBecause many genes belonging to HLA remain unidentified, positional cloning (a method used to identify a specific gene, when only its location on a chromosome is known) has been used to determine that a mucin-like gene is associated with DPB. In addition, diseases caused by identified HLA genes in the DPB-susceptibility region have been investigated. One of these, bare lymphocyte syndrome I (BLS I), exhibits a number of similarities with DPB in those affected, including chronic sinusitis, bronchiolar inflammation and nodules, and the presence of H. influenzae. Also like DPB, BLS I responds favorably to erythromycin therapy by showing a resolution of symptoms. The similarities between these two diseases, the corresponding success with the same mode of treatment, and the fact that the gene responsible for BLS I is located within the DPB-causing area of HLA narrows the establishment of a gene responsible for DPB.[9] Environmental factors such as inhaling toxic fumes and cigarette smoking are not believed to play a role in DPB, and unknown environmental and other non-genetic causes—such as unidentified bacteria or viruses—have not been ruled out.[4][6][7]\nCystic fibrosis (CF), a progressive multi-system lung disease, has been considered in the search for a genetic cause of DPB. This is for a number of reasons. CF, like DPB, causes severe lung inflammation, abundant mucus production, infection, and shows a genetic predominance among Caucasians of one geographic group to the rarity of others; whereas DPB dominates among East Asians, CF mainly affects individuals of European descent. While no gene has been implicated as the cause of DPB, mutation in a specific gene—much more likely to occur in Europeans—causes CF. This mutation in the CF-causing gene is not a factor in DPB, but a unique polymorphism (variation) in this gene is known to occur in many Asians not necessarily affected by either disease. It is being investigated whether this gene in any state of mutation could contribute to DPB.[4][9]",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of DPB requires analysis of the lungs and bronchiolar tissues, which can require a lung biopsy, or the more preferred high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan of the lungs.[7] The diagnostic criteria include severe inflammation in all layers of the respiratory bronchioles and lung tissue lesions that appear as nodules within the terminal and respiratory bronchioles in both lungs.[4] The nodules in DPB appear as opaque lumps when viewed on X-rays of the lung, and can cause airway obstruction, which is evaluated by a pulmonary function test, or PFT.[6]   Lung X-rays can also reveal dilation of the bronchiolar passages, another sign of DPB. HRCT scans often show blockages of some bronchiolar passages with mucus, which is referred to as the \"tree-in-bud\" pattern.[7]  Hypoxemia, another sign of breathing difficulty, is revealed by measuring the oxygen and carbon dioxide content of the blood, using a blood test called arterial blood gas. Other findings observed with DPB include the proliferation of lymphocytes (white blood cells that fight infection), neutrophils, and foamy histiocytes (tissue macrophages) in the lung lining. Bacteria such as H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa are also detectable, with the latter becoming more prominent as the disease progresses.[4][5] The white blood, bacterial and other cellular content of the blood can be measured by taking a complete blood count (CBC). Elevated levels of IgG and IgA (classes of immunoglobulins) may be seen, as well as the presence of rheumatoid factor (an indicator of autoimmunity). Hemagglutination, a clumping of red blood cells in response to the presence of antibodies in the blood, may also occur. Neutrophils, beta-defensins, leukotrienes, and chemokines can also be detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid injected then removed from the bronchiolar airways of individuals with DPB, for evaluation.[4][9]\nIn the differential diagnosis (finding the correct diagnosis between diseases that have overlapping features) of some obstructive lung diseases, DPB is often considered. A number of DPB symptoms resemble those found with other obstructive lung diseases such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema. Wheezing, coughing with sputum production, and shortness of breath are common symptoms in such diseases, and obstructive respiratory functional impairment is found on pulmonary function testing.[6] Cystic fibrosis, like DPB, causes severe lung inflammation, excess mucus production, and infection; but DPB does not cause disturbances of the pancreas nor the electrolytes, as does CF, so the two diseases are different and probably unrelated.[4][9]  DPB is distinguished by the presence of lesions that appear on X-rays as nodules in the bronchioles of both lungs; inflammation in all tissue layers of the respiratory bronchioles; and its higher prevalence among individuals with East Asian lineage.[4]\nDPB and bronchiolitis obliterans are two forms of primary bronchiolitis.[2] Specific overlapping features of both diseases include strong cough with large amounts of often pus-filled sputum; nodules viewable on lung X-rays in the lower bronchi and bronchiolar area; and chronic sinusitis. In DPB, the nodules are more restricted to the respiratory bronchioles, while in OB they are often found in the membranous bronchioles (the initial non-cartilaginous section of the bronchiole, that divides from the tertiary bronchus) up to the secondary bronchus. OB is a bronchiolar disease with worldwide prevalence, while DPB has more localized prevalence, predominantly in Japan.[2][6] Prior to clinical recognition of DPB in recent years, it was often misdiagnosed as bronchiectasia, COPD, IPF, phthisis miliaris, sarcoidosis or alveolar cell carcinoma.[15]",
    "Treatment": "Macrolide antibiotics, such as erythromycin, are an effective treatment for DPB when taken regularly over an extended period of time.[16][17][18] Clarithromycin or roxithromycin are also commonly used.[19] The successful results of macrolides in DPB and similar lung diseases stems from managing certain symptoms through immunomodulation (adjusting the immune response),[17] which can be achieved by taking the antibiotics in low doses. Treatment consists of daily oral administration of erythromycin[7] for two to three years, an extended period that has been shown to dramatically improve the effects of DPB. This is apparent when an individual undergoing treatment for DPB, among a number of disease-related remission criteria, has a normal neutrophil count detected in BAL fluid, and blood gas (an arterial blood test that measures the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood) readings show that free oxygen in the blood is within the normal range.[16][17][20] Allowing a temporary break from erythromycin therapy in these instances has been suggested, to reduce the formation of macrolide-resistant P. aeruginosa.[16] However, DPB symptoms usually return, and treatment would need to be resumed. Although highly effective, erythromycin may not prove successful in all individuals with the disease, particularly if macrolide-resistant P. aeruginosa is present or previously untreated DPB has progressed to the point where respiratory failure is occurring.[17][20]\nWith erythromycin therapy in DPB, great reduction in bronchiolar inflammation and damage is achieved through suppression of not only neutrophil proliferation, but also lymphocyte activity and obstructive mucus and water secretions in airways.[16] The antibiotic effects of macrolides are not involved in their beneficial effects toward reducing inflammation in DPB.[20] This is evident because the treatment dosage is much too low to fight infection, and in DPB cases with the occurrence of macrolide-resistant P. aeruginosa, erythromycin therapy still reduces inflammation.[16]\nA number of factors are involved in suppression of inflammation by erythromycin and other macrolides. They are especially effective at inhibiting the proliferation of neutrophils, by diminishing the ability of interleukin 8 and leukotriene B4 to attract them.[21] Macrolides also reduce the efficiency of adhesion molecules that allow neutrophils to stick to bronchiolar tissue linings. Mucus production in the airways is a major culprit in the morbidity and mortality of DPB and other respiratory diseases. The significant reduction of inflammation in DPB attributed to erythromycin therapy also helps to inhibit the production of excess mucus.[21]",
    "Prognosis": "Untreated DPB leads to bronchiectasis, respiratory failure, and death. A journal report from 1983 indicated that untreated DPB had a five-year survival rate of 62.1%, while the 10-year survival rate was 33.2%.[6] With erythromycin treatment, individuals with DPB now have a much longer life expectancy due to better management of symptoms, delay of progression, and prevention of associated infections like P. aeruginosa.[20] The 10-year survival rate for treated DPB is about 90%.[4] In DPB cases where treatment has resulted in significant improvement, which sometimes happens after about two years, treatment has been allowed to end for a while. However, individuals allowed to stop treatment during this time are closely monitored. As DPB has been proven to recur, erythromycin therapy must be promptly resumed once disease symptoms begin to reappear. In spite of the improved prognosis when treated, DPB currently has no known cure.[4][9]",
    "Epidemiology": "DPB has its highest prevalence among the Japanese, at 11 per 100,000 population.[4] Korean,[22] Chinese,[23] and Thai[24] individuals with the disease have been reported as well. A genetic predisposition among East Asians is suggested.[9] The disease is more common in males,[25] with the male to female ratio at 1.4–2:1 (or about 5 men to 3 women).[4] The average onset of the disease is around age 40, and two-thirds of those affected are non-smokers, although smoking is not believed to be a cause.[7] The presence of HLA-Bw54 increases the risk of diffuse panbronchiolitis 13.3-fold.[26]\nIn Europe and the Americas, a relatively small number of DPB cases have been reported in Asian immigrants and residents, as well as in individuals of non-Asian ancestry.[27][28][29] Misdiagnosis has occurred in the West owing to less recognition of the disease than in Asian countries. Relative to the large number of Asians living in the west, the small number of them thought to be affected by DPB suggests non-genetic factors may play some role in its cause. This rarity seen in Western Asians may also be partly associated with misdiagnosis.[7][30]"

    "Disease": "Diplocoria",
    "Signs and symptoms": "People with diplocoria or pseudopolycoria may experience glare, photophobia, ghosting, or monocular diplopia, due to multiple apertures disrupting the eye's optical system; reducing the effective pupil size can improve optical quality (\"pinhole\" effect).[4][5] In children, small reactive pupils and multiple apertures have been associated with intense miosis and amblyopia in case reports.[6]",
    "Causes": "True diplocoria is generally congenital and exceptionally uncommon. Apparent diplocoria is more often acquired pseudopolycoria from:",
    "Diagnosis": "Slit-lamp examination documents the number, position, and shape of openings. In true diplocoria, both pupils constrict and dilate together to light or pharmacologic stimuli, indicating separate sphincters; in pseudopolycoria, only the primary pupil reacts.[1][2] Anterior-segment imaging and careful pharmacologic testing of the pupillary light reflex help differentiate true from false accessory pupils.[10]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment depends on symptoms and the underlying cause. Visual symptoms from pseudopolycoria may be reduced with prosthetic or tinted contact lenses that limit stray light or create a single functional aperture.[4] Selected cases of true diplocoria (true polycoria) have been treated surgically (e.g., pupilloplasty) to reconstruct a single round pupil.[11]",
    "Epidemiology": "Diplocoria in the strict, \"true\" sense is very rare and mainly documented in isolated case reports; most \"double pupil\" appearances are pseudopolycoria rather than true accessory pupils.[1][2]"

    "Disease": "Donohue syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Facial features indicative of Donohue syndrome include protuberant and low-set ears, flaring nostrils, unusually large mouth, thick lips, and widely spaced eyes. Physical features include stunted growth (including during gestation), lack of subcutaneous adipose tissue, muscle atrophy, hirsutism (excessive body hair growth), and dysplasia (nail malformation).[3] Additionally, a condition known as acanthosis nigricans is present in affected individuals. In acanthosis nigricans, patches of skin darken and thicken to gain a velvet-like appearance. Gender specific features also include enlarged clitoris and breasts, as well as ovarian cysts in affected females, and enlarged penis in affected males.[3] In the Journal of Pediatric Medicine, Donohue and Uchida described affected sisters whose growth appeared to have ended in the seventh month of gestation, both born alive but dying before four months of age.[4] Very early death (or spontaneous abortion) is typical, although affected individuals sometimes live longer than a decade.[4]\nEndocrine related abnormalities as a result of insulin receptor malfunction include insulin resistance, hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia (depending on whether or not the individual has eaten) and hyperinsulemia.[citation needed]\nA much milder form of the disease, in which there is some insulin resistance but normal growth and subcutaneous fat distribution, is also known.[5] It is caused by a less severe mutation of the same gene.",
    "Causes": "Donohue syndrome is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. The mutations responsible for the disorder are found on the short arm chromosome 19 (19p13.2) within the coding sequence of the INSR gene (insulin receptor) causing the production of inactive receptor molecules.[1] There are several mutations that can be responsible for the disease, as any mutation that severely impairs the functionality of the insulin receptor will have similar effects. The INSR gene spans over one hundred and twenty thousand base pairs, which contain twenty-two exons coding for a protein that consists of 1382 amino acids.[6] Some of the introns may or may not be spliced out depending on the kind of cell.[7]\nKnown mutations to the gene which can cause Donohue syndrome include a nonsense mutation that resulted in early termination of the protein, an addition or deletion mutation that resulted in a frame shift,[8] a single missense mutation[4] and in the milder form mentioned above, a single codon change that altered isoleucine to methionine in the receptor protein.[4] Some mutations to the gene instead result in insulin resistant diabetes without Donohue syndrome.[4]\nBecause mutations in the gene are extremely rare, most cases result from consanguineous matings, for example, between cousins.[4] However, the exact mutation need not be the same. Disease can be caused by inheritance of two different mutant alleles, one from each parent, in which case the patient is a compound heterozygote.[9]\nA heterozygous individual (i.e. one who is a carrier for the disease, having only one normal allele for the insulin receptor) will not be affected. Two heterozygous parents have, in theory, a one in four chance of having a child with the disease, and two thirds of their unaffected children will be carriers. However, because spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) often results when the fetus has the disease, in actuality the proportion of children born alive with Donohue syndrome will be lower than 25%.[4]\nIt is possible to do a genetic test to identify carriers, but because it is so rare, this is not usually done unless there is reason to suspect that the individual being tested is a carrier, for instance having an affected sibling or cousin. As expected for a genetic disease that can be caused by many different mutations, it is not limited to a specific ethnic group, and has been seen in people of various ethnicities.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "There are a few ways to diagnose Donohue syndrome. Due to the nature of the disorder, Donohue syndrome can be diagnosed either genetically, symptomatically, or both. Because Donohue syndrome is a genetic disorder, genetic testing can be performed to diagnose the disease. These genetic tests include diagnostic testing, carrier testing, predictive and pre-symptomatic testing, as well as forensic testing. Prenatally, amniocentesis can be performed to determine if the child will have Donohue syndrome.[2] Additionally, the disorder can be diagnosed through laboratory testing to measure blood insulin levels and defective insulin receptors.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "While there currently is no cure for Donohue syndrome, treatments for those with the disease are tailored specifically to the symptoms present in each individual. It is often that a team of medical professionals will come together to treat a patient with this condition in their specific realm of practice such as pediatrics, endocrinology, and dermatology.[3] Treatment will often address specific dysfunctions in the patient, such as skin defects, hormonal imbalances, and normal progression of child growth.[citation needed]",
    "Prognosis": "The prognosis is quite dire, with early death usual.[1] In fact, most patients die in their first year except in milder forms of the disease, but few are known to have lived longer.[4] The variation is unsurprising given the diversity of mutations causing the disease.",
    "Epidemiology": "Donohue syndrome is an extremely rare disorder that occurs in one of every million births worldwide. Several dozen cases have been reported in the medical community, and in the reported cases of the disorder, it has been found that the females are twice as likely to have the disorder as men.[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy causes progressive muscle weakness due to muscle fiber disarray, death, and replacement with connective tissue or fat.[3] The voluntary muscles are affected first, especially those of the hips, pelvic area, thighs, calves.[3][2][12] It eventually progresses to the shoulders and neck, followed by arms, respiratory muscles, and other areas.[12] Fatigue is common.[13]\nSigns usually appear before age five, and may even be observed when a boy takes his first steps.[14] There is general difficulty with motor skills, which can result in an awkward manner of walking, stepping, or running.[15] They tend to walk on their toes,[15] in part due to shortening of the Achilles tendon,[16] and because it compensates for knee extensor weakness.[12] Falls can be frequent.[17] It becomes increasingly difficult for the boy to walk. The ability to walk usually disintegrates completely before age 13.[15] Most men affected with Duchenne muscular dystrophy become essentially \"paralyzed from the neck down\" by the age of 21.[14] Cardiomyopathy, particularly dilated cardiomyopathy, is common, seen in half of 18-year-olds.[15] The development of congestive heart failure or arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat) is only occasional.[12] In late stages of the disease, respiratory impairment and swallowing impairment can occur, which can result in pneumonia.[18]\nA classic sign of Duchenne muscular dystrophy is trouble getting up from a lying or sitting position,[17] as manifested by a positive Gowers's sign. When a child tries to rise from lying on his stomach, he compensates for pelvic muscle weakness through the use of the upper extremities:[15] first by rising to stand on his arms and knees, and then \"walking\" his hands up his legs to stand upright. Another characteristic sign of Duchenne muscular dystrophy is pseudohypertrophy (enlarging) of the muscles of the tongue, calves, buttocks, and shoulders (around age 4 or 5). Fat and connective tissue eventually replace the muscle tissue, hence the term pseudohypertrophy. Muscle fiber deformities and muscle contractures of Achilles tendon and hamstrings can occur, which impair functionality because the muscle fibers shorten and fibrose in connective tissue.[12] Skeletal deformities can occur, such as lumbar hyperlordosis, scoliosis, anterior pelvic tilt, and chest deformities. Lumbar hyperlordosis is thought to be a compensatory mechanism in response to gluteal and quadriceps muscle weakness, all of which cause altered posture and gait (e.g.: restricted hip extension).[19][20]\nNon-musculoskeletal manifestations of Duchenne muscular dystrophy occur. There is a higher risk of neurobehavioral disorders (e.g., ADHD), learning disorders (dyslexia), and non-progressive weaknesses in specific cognitive skills (in particular short-term verbal memory),[15] which are believed to be the result of inadequate dystrophin in the brain.[21]",
    "Causes": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by a mutation of the dystrophin gene, located on the short arm of the X chromosome (locus Xp21)[22] that codes for dystrophin protein. Mutations can either be inherited or occur spontaneously during germline transmission,[citation needed] causing a large reduction or absence of dystrophin, a protein that provides structural integrity in muscle cells.[23] Dystrophin is responsible for connecting the actin cytoskeleton of each muscle fiber to the underlying basal lamina (extracellular matrix), through a protein complex containing many subunits. The absence of dystrophin permits excess calcium to penetrate the sarcolemma (the muscle cell membrane).[24]\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy is extremely rare in females (about 1 in 50,000,000 female births).[6] It can occur in females with an affected father and a carrier mother, in those who are missing an X chromosome, or in those who have an inactivated X chromosome (the most common of the rare reasons).[25] The daughter of a carrier mother and an affected father will be affected or a carrier with equal probability, as she will always inherit the affected X-chromosome from her father and has a 50% chance of also inheriting the affected X-chromosome from her mother.[26]\nDisruption of the blood–brain barrier has been seen to be a noted feature in the development of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.[27]",
    "Diagnosis": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy can be detected with about 95% accuracy by genetic studies performed during pregnancy.[18]\nThe muscle-specific isoform of the dystrophin gene is composed of 79 exons, and DNA testing (blood test) and analysis can usually identify the specific type of mutation of the exon or exons that are affected. DNA testing confirms the diagnosis in most cases.[28]\nIf DNA testing fails to find the mutation, a muscle biopsy test may be performed.[29] A small sample of muscle tissue is extracted using a biopsy needle. The key tests performed on the biopsy sample for Duchenne muscular dystrophy are immunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry, and immunoblotting for dystrophin, and should be interpreted by an experienced neuromuscular pathologist.[30] These tests provide information on the presence or absence of the protein. Absence of the protein is a positive test for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Where dystrophin is present, the tests indicate the amount and molecular size of dystrophin, helping to distinguish Duchenne muscular dystrophy from milder dystrophinopathy phenotypes.[31] Over the past several years, DNA tests have been developed that detect more of the many mutations that cause the condition, and muscle biopsy is not required as often to confirm the presence of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.[32]\nA prenatal test can be considered when the mother is a known or suspected carrier.[33]\nBefore invasive testing, determination of the fetal sex is important; while males are sometimes affected by this X-linked disease, female Duchenne muscular dystrophy is extremely rare. This can be achieved by ultrasound scan at 16 weeks or more recently by free fetal DNA (cffDNA) testing. Chorion villus sampling (CVS) can be done at 11–14 weeks and has a 1% risk of miscarriage. Amniocentesis can be done after 15 weeks and has a 0.5% risk of miscarriage. Non invasive prenatal testing can be done around 10–12 weeks.[34] Another option in the case of unclear genetic test results is fetal muscle biopsy.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "No cure for Duchenne muscular dystrophy is known.[35]\nTreatment is generally aimed at controlling symptoms to maximize the quality of life which can be measured using specific questionnaires,[36] and include:\nThe medication eteplirsen, a Morpholino antisense oligo, has been approved in the United States for the treatment of mutations amenable to dystrophin exon 51 skipping. The US approval has been controversial[42] as eteplirsen failed to establish a clinical benefit;[43] it has been refused approval by the European Medicines Agency.[44][45]\nThe medication ataluren (Translarna) is approved for use in the European Union.[46][47]\nThe antisense oligonucleotide golodirsen (Vyondys 53) was approved for medical use in the United States in 2019, for the treatment of cases that can benefit from skipping exon 53 of the dystrophin transcript.[48][49]\nThe Morpholino antisense oligonucleotide viltolarsen (Viltepso) was approved for medical use in the United States in August 2020, for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in people who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 53 skipping.[50]  Developed by Nippon Shinyaku and the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry (NCNP), viltolarsen's pre-clinical development was supported by pioneering work from Toshifumi Yokota and colleagues.[51] It is the second approved targeted treatment for people with this type of mutation in the United States.[50] Approximately 8% of people with DMD have a mutation that is amenable to exon 53 skipping.[50]\nCasimersen (Amondys 45) was approved for medical use in the United States in February 2021,[52] and it is the first FDA-approved targeted treatment for people who have a confirmed mutation of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene that is amenable to exon 45 skipping.[52]\nComprehensive multidisciplinary care guidelines for Duchenne muscular dystrophy have been developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and were published in 2010.[29] An update was published in 2018.[53][54]\nDelandistrogene moxeparvovec (Elevidys) is a gene therapy that in June 2023 received United States FDA accelerated approval for the treatment of four and five-year-old children.[55][56]\nIn October 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Vamorolone (Agamree) as a Treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Catalyst Pharmaceuticals holds the exclusive North American license and commercial rights.[57]\nIn March 2024, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved givinostat (Duvyzat), an oral medication, to be used in the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy in people aged six years and older. Givinostat is the first nonsteroidal drug to receive FDA approval for the treatment of all genetic variants of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Functioning as a histone deacetylase (Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, givinostat operates by targeting pathogenic processes within the body, ultimately leading to a reduction in inflammation and muscle loss associated with the disease.[58]",
    "Prognosis": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a rare progressive disease that eventually affects all voluntary muscles and involves the heart and breathing muscles in later stages. Life expectancy is estimated to be around 25–26,[18][59] but this varies. People born with Duchenne muscular dystrophy after 1990 have a median life expectancy of approximately 28–30.[11][5] With excellent medical care, affected men often live into their 30s.[60] The oldest surviving person in the world with the disease is 64 years old.[61]\nThe most common direct cause of death in people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy is respiratory failure. Complications from treatment, such as mechanical ventilation and tracheotomy procedures, are also a concern. The next leading cause of death is cardiac-related conditions such as heart failure brought on by dilated cardiomyopathy. With respiratory assistance, the median survival age can reach up to 40. In rare cases, people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy have been seen to survive into their forties or early fifties, with proper positioning in wheelchairs and beds, and the use of ventilator support (via tracheostomy or mouthpiece), airway clearance, and heart medications.[62] Early planning of the required supports for later-life care has shown greater longevity for people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.[63]\nCuriously, in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the lack of dystrophin is associated with increased calcium levels and skeletal muscle myonecrosis. The intrinsic laryngeal muscles (ILMs) are protected and do not undergo myonecrosis.[64] ILMs have a calcium regulation system profile suggestive of a better ability to handle calcium changes in comparison to other muscles, and this may provide a mechanistic insight for their unique pathophysiological properties.[65] In addition, patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy also have elevated plasma lipoprotein levels, implying a primary state of dyslipidemia in patients.[66]",
    "Epidemiology": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most common type of muscular dystrophy; it affects about one in 5,000 males at birth.[3] Duchenne muscular dystrophy has an incidence of one in 3,600 male infants.[18]\nIn the US, a 2010 study showed a higher amount of those with Duchenne muscular dystrophy age ranging from 5 to 54 who are Hispanic compared to non-Hispanic Whites, and non-Hispanic Blacks.[67][68]",
    "Society and culture": "As of 2023, the US states Ohio and New York require newborns to be screened for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.[74][75] As of 2024, Minnesota requires newborn screening.[76]"

    "Disease": "Dupuytren%27s contracture",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Typically, Dupuytren's contracture first presents as a thickening or nodule in the palm, which initially can be with or without pain.[13] Later in the disease process, which can be years later,[14] there is increasing loss of range of motion of the affected finger(s). The earliest sign of a contracture is a triangular \"puckering\" of the skin of the palm as it passes over the flexor tendon just before the flexor crease of the finger, at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint.[citation needed]\nDupuytren disease is generally considered painless, but can be painful if nerve tissue is involved, although this is not usually discussed in the literature.[7] The most common finger to be affected is the ring finger; the thumb and index finger are much less often affected.[15] \nThe disease begins in the palm and moves towards the fingers, with the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints affected before the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints.[16] \nThe MCP joints at the base of the finger responds much better to treatment and are usually able to fully extend after treatment. Due to anatomic differences in the ligaments and extensor tendons at the PIP joints, they may have some residual flexion. Proper patient education is necessary to set realistic treatment expectation.\nIn Dupuytren's contracture, the palmar fascia within the hand becomes abnormally thick, which can cause the fingers to curl and can impair finger function. The main function of the palmar fascia is to increase grip strength; thus, over time, Dupuytren's contracture decreases a person's ability to hold objects and use the hand in many different activities. Dupuytren's contracture can also be experienced as embarrassing in social situations and can affect quality of life.[17] People may report pain, aching, and itching with the contractions. Normally, the palmar fascia consists of collagen type I, but in Dupuytren patients, the collagen changes to collagen type III, which is significantly thicker than collagen type I.[18]\nPeople with severe involvement often show lumps on the back of their finger joints (called \"Garrod's pads\", \"knuckle pads\", or \"dorsal Dupuytren nodules\"), and lumps in the arch of the feet (plantar fibromatosis or Ledderhose disease).[2] In severe cases, the area where the palm meets the wrist may develop lumps. It is thought the condition Peyronie's disease is related to Dupuytren's contracture.[19]\nIn one study those with stage 2 of the disease were found to have a slightly increased risk of mortality, especially from cancer.[20]",
    "Diagnosis": "There may be three types of Dupuytren's disease:[32]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment is indicated when the so-called table-top test is positive. With this test, the person places their hand on a table. If the hand lies completely flat on the table, the test is considered negative. If the hand cannot be placed completely flat on the table, leaving a space between the table and a part of the hand as big as the diameter of a ballpoint pen, the test is considered positive and surgery or other treatment may be indicated. Additionally, finger joints may become fixed and rigid. There are several types of treatment, with some hands needing repeated treatment.[citation needed]\nThe main categories listed by the International Dupuytren Society in order of stage of disease are radiation therapy, needle aponeurotomy (NA), collagenase injection, and hand surgery. As of 2016[update] the evidence on the efficacy of radiation therapy was considered inadequate in quantity and quality, and difficult to interpret because of uncertainty about the natural history of Dupuytren's disease.[34]\nNeedle aponeurotomy is most effective for Stages I and II, covering 6–90 degrees of deformation of the finger. However, it is also used at other stages.\nCollagenase injection is likewise most effective for Stages I and II. However, it is also used at other stages.[citation needed]\nHand surgery is effective at stage I to stage IV.[35]\nUse of a splint to keep treated fingers straight following various forms of treatment, typically at all times for some days, then at nighttime for some weeks, is usual. However, a 2015 Cochrane review concluded: \"low-quality evidence suggests that postoperative splinting may not improve outcomes and may impair outcomes by reducing active flexion. Further trials on this topic are urgently required\".[36]\nOn 12 June 1831, Dupuytren performed a surgical procedure on a person with contracture of the fourth and fifth digits who had been previously told by other surgeons that the only remedy was cutting the flexor tendons. He described the condition and the operation in The Lancet in 1834[37] after presenting it in 1833, and posthumously in 1836 in a French publication by Hôtel-Dieu de Paris.[38] The procedure he described was a minimally invasive needle procedure.\nBecause of high recurrence rates,[citation needed] new surgical techniques were introduced, such as fasciectomy and then dermofasciectomy. Most of the diseased tissue is removed with these procedures.Recurrence rates are low.[clarify] For some individuals, the partial insertion of \"K-wires\" into either the DIP or PIP joint of the affected digit for a period of a least 21 days to fuse the joint is the only way to halt the disease's progress. After removal of the wires, the joint is fixed into flexion, which is considered preferable to fusion at extension.\nResearch using large datasets in the UK has shown surgery to be safe and effective. When surgery needs to be repeated, however, the research suggests there are higher risks of serious complications such as finger amputation.[39][40] Amputation of fingers may be needed for severe or recurrent cases or after surgical complications.[41]\nLimited/selective fasciectomy removes the pathological tissue, and is a common approach.[42][43][44] A 2015 Cochrane review reported that low-quality evidence suggested that fasciectomy may be more effective for people with advanced Dupuytren's contractures.[36]\nDuring the procedure, the person is under regional or general anesthesia. A surgical tourniquet prevents blood flow to the limb.[45] The skin is often opened with a zig-zag incision but straight incisions with or without Z-plasty are also described and may reduce damage to neurovascular bundles.[46] All diseased cords and fascia are excised.[42][43][45] The excision has to be very precise to spare the neurovascular bundles.[45] Because not all the diseased tissue is visible macroscopically, complete excision is uncertain.[43]\nA 20-year review of surgical complications associated with fasciectomy showed that major complications occurred in 15.7% of cases, including digital nerve injury (3.4%), digital artery injury (2%), infection (2.4%), hematoma (2.1%), and complex regional pain syndrome (5.5%), in addition to minor complications including painful flare reactions in 9.9% of cases and wound healing complications in 22.9% of cases.[47] After the tissue is removed the incision is closed. In the case of a shortage of skin, the transverse part of the zig-zag incision is left open. Stitches are removed 10 days after surgery.[45]\nAfter surgery, the hand is wrapped in a light compressive bandage for one week. Flexion and extension of the fingers can start as soon as the anaesthesia has resolved. It is common to experience tingling within the first week after surgery.[36] Hand therapy is often recommended.[45] Approximately six weeks after surgery the patient is able completely to use the hand.[48]\nThe average recurrence rate is 39% after a fasciectomy after a median interval of about four years.[49]\nLimited/selective fasciectomy under local anesthesia (LA) with epinephrine but no tourniquet is possible. In 2005, Denkler described the technique.[50][51]\nDermofasciectomy is a surgical procedure that may be used when:\nTypically, the excised skin is replaced with a skin graft, usually full thickness,[43] consisting of the epidermis and the entire dermis. In most cases the graft is taken from the antecubital fossa (the crease of skin at the elbow joint) or the inner side of the upper arm.[53][54] This place is chosen because the skin color best matches the palm's skin color. The skin on the inner side of the upper arm is thin and has enough skin to supply a full-thickness graft. The donor site can be closed with a direct suture.[53]\nThe graft is sutured to the skin surrounding the wound. For one week the hand is protected with a dressing. The hand and arm are elevated with a sling. The dressing is then removed and careful mobilization can be started, gradually increasing in intensity.[53] After this procedure the risk of recurrence is minimised,[43][53][54] but Dupuytren's can recur in the skin graft[55] and complications from surgery may occur.[vague][56]\nSegmental fasciectomy involves excising part(s) of the contracted cord so that it disappears or no longer contracts the finger. It is less invasive than the limited fasciectomy, because not all the diseased tissue is excised and the skin incisions are smaller.[57]\nThe person is placed under regional anesthesia and a surgical tourniquet is used. The skin is opened with small curved incisions over the diseased tissue. If necessary, incisions are made in the fingers.[57] Pieces of cord and fascia of approximately one centimeter are excised. The cords are placed under maximum tension while they are cut. A scalpel is used to separate the tissues.[57] The surgeon keeps removing small parts until the finger can fully extend.[57][58] The patient is encouraged to start moving their hand the day after surgery.[57] After surgery people wear a light pressure dressing for four days, followed by an extension splint, typically continuously for a few weeks, then every night for eight weeks.[58]\nThe same procedure is used in the segmental fasciectomy with cellulose implant. After the excision and a careful hemostasis, the cellulose implant is placed in a single layer in between the remaining parts of the cord.[58]\nStudies have been conducted for percutaneous release, extensive percutaneous aponeurotomy with lipografting and collagenase. These treatments show promise.[59][60][61][62]\nNeedle aponeurotomy is a minimally-invasive technique where the cords are weakened through the insertion and manipulation of a small needle. It is applicable only if the contracture is clearly visible. The hand is first numbed by injection with local anaesthetic.[63] The cord is then sectioned at as many levels as possible in the palm and fingers, depending on the location and extent of the disease, using perhaps a 25-gauge needle mounted on a 10 ml syringe.[59] Once weakened, the offending cords can be snapped by putting tension on the finger(s) and pulling the finger(s) straight. After the treatment a small dressing is applied for 24 hours, after which people are able to use their hands normally. No splints or physiotherapy are given.[59]\nThe advantage of needle aponeurotomy is the minimal intervention without incision (done in the office under local anesthesia) and the very rapid return to normal activities without need for rehabilitation, but the nodules may resume growing.[64] A study reported postoperative gain is greater at the MCP joint level than at the level of the IP-joint and found a reoperation rate of 24%; complications are scarce.[65] Needle aponeurotomy may be performed on fingers that are severely bent (stage IV), and not just in early stages. A 2003 study showed 85% recurrence rate after five years.[66]\nA comprehensive review of the results of needle aponeurotomy in 1,013 fingers was performed by Gary M. Pess, MD, Rebecca Pess, DPT, and Rachel Pess, PsyD, and published in the Journal of Hand Surgery April 2012. Minimal follow-up was three years. Metacarpophalangeal joint (MP) contractures were corrected at an average of 99% and proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP) contractures at an average of 89% immediately post procedure. At final follow-up, 72% of the correction was maintained for MP joints and 31% for PIP joints. The difference between the final corrections for MP versus PIP joints was statistically significant. When comparing people aged below and above 55 years of age there was a statistically significant difference at both MP and PIP joints, with greater correction maintained in the older group.[citation needed]\nGender differences were not statistically significant. Needle aponeurotomy provided successful correction to 5° or less contracture immediately post procedure in 98% (791) of MP joints and 67% (350) of PIP joints. There was recurrence of 20° or less over the original post-procedure corrected level in 80% (646) of MP joints and 35% (183) of PIP joints. Complications were rare except for skin tears, which occurred in 3.4% (34) of digits. This study showed that NA is a safe procedure that can be performed in an outpatient setting. The complication rate was low, but recurrences were frequent in younger people and for PIP contractures.[67]\nA technique introduced in 2011 is extensive percutaneous aponeurotomy with lipografting.[60] This procedure also uses a needle to cut the cords. The difference with the percutaneous needle fasciotomy is that the cord is cut at many places. The cord is also separated from the skin to make place for the lipograft that is taken from the abdomen or ipsilateral flank.[60] This technique shortens the recovery time. The fat graft results in supple skin.[60]\nBefore the aponeurotomy, a liposuction is done to the abdomen and ipsilateral flank to collect the lipograft.[60] The treatment can be performed under regional or general anesthesia. The digits are placed under maximal extension tension using a firm lead hand retractor. The surgeon makes multiple palmar puncture wounds with small nicks. The tension on the cords is crucial, because tight constricting bands are most susceptible to be cut and torn by the small nicks, whereas the relatively loose neurovascular structures are spared. After the cord is completely cut and separated from the skin the lipograft is injected under the skin. A total of about 5 to 10 ml is injected per ray.[60]\nAfter the treatment the person wears an extension splint for 5 to 7 days. Thereafter the person returns to normal activities and is advised to use a night splint for up to 20 weeks.[60]",
    "Prognosis": "Dupuytren's disease has a high recurrence rate, especially when a person has so-called Dupuytren's diathesis. The term diathesis relates to certain features of Dupuytren's disease, and indicates an aggressive course of disease.[33]\nThe presence of all new Dupuytren's diathesis factors increases the risk of recurrent Dupuytren's disease by 71%, compared with a baseline risk of 23% in people lacking the factors.[33] In another study the prognostic value of diathesis was evaluated. It was concluded that presence of diathesis can predict recurrence and extension.[85] A scoring system was made to evaluate the risk of recurrence and extension, based on the following values: bilateral hand involvement, little-finger surgery, early onset of disease, plantar fibrosis, knuckle pads, and radial side involvement.[85]\nMinimally invasive therapies may precede higher recurrence rates. Recurrence lacks a consensus definition. Furthermore, different standards and measurements follow from the various definitions.[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Patients usually present with abdominal symptoms such as altered bowel habits, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and early satiety.[5] In the early stages, these symptoms can be linked to signs of inflammation such as pyrexia and elevated CRP, and/or blood-stained ascites.[6]\nAbdominal pain, fullness, overt bowel obstruction, and the presence of an abdominal mass are linked to the late stages of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis. The intestines become gradually covered with a fibrous cocoon, which causes weight loss, malnutrition, bowel obstruction, ischemia and strangulation, infection, and death.[3]",
    "Causes": "Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis is typically observed in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving long-term peritoneal dialysis therapy. Dialysis fluid's high glucose content and acidic pH cause harm to the peritoneum.[7] High glucose concentrations promote osmosis and diffusion gradients across the peritoneum, while low pH inhibits the production of harmful glucose degradation products (GDPs).[8] GDPs are created when peritoneal dialysis fluid is heated to sterilize it[9] and these result in the production of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) when glucose is present.[10] Less GDP-containing biocompatible solutions are now more frequently used, which lessens peritoneal damage.[11]\nEncapsulating peritoneal sclerosis can also occur in patients who are not on peritoneal dialysis but are suffering from other illnesses like endometriosis, sarcoidosis, peritoneal and intra-abdominal cancers, chronic peritoneal ascites, intraperitoneal chemotherapy, intraperitoneal exposure to particulate matter or disinfectant, abdominal surgery, intraperitoneal infections (tuberculosis), and beta-blocker administration.[12][13]\nThe length of peritoneal dialysis treatment appears to be the primary risk factor for encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis development. The incidence of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis rose with the length of peritoneal dialysis (PD) in an Australian survey; for patients on PD for more than 2, 5, 6, and 8 years, the rates were 1.9, 6.4, 10.8, and 19.4%, respectively.[14]\nGiven that there is a high incidence of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis shortly after renal transplantation, organ transplantation seems to increase the risk of developing this condition.[15]\nA frequent side effect of peritoneal dialysis, peritonitis is intricately linked to the development of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis, with the frequency of episodes being correlated with the occurrence of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis.[16] Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis has been specifically linked to recurrent peritonitis caused by bacterial contamination,[17] specifically from Pseudomonas spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and specific fungal[18] organisms.[14]\nImplicated triggers include systemic rheumatologic and inflammatory disorders,[19][20] dermoid cyst rupture,[21] gynecologic neoplasms,[22][23] endometriosis,[24] organ transplantation,[25][26][27] cirrhosis,[28] mechanical or chemical intraperitoneal irritants,[29][30][31] infection,[32][33] and medications.[34][35]",
    "Diagnosis": "Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis is diagnosed clinically, supported by radiography or laparotomy, and based on a constellation of clinical findings.[5]\nThe non-specific laboratory results associated with encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis are linked to underlying infections, malnourishment, and inflammation.[44][36] It has been demonstrated that dialysate from patients with encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis had higher levels of inflammatory cytokines than did peritoneal dialysis controls, sometimes up to years before the condition's clinical manifestation.[45][46] Nevertheless, no biomarker has been discovered to help anticipate the onset of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis.[47]\nWhen distinguishing encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis from other causes of intestinal obstruction, imaging is frequently useful. Advanced encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis may be suggested by abdominal plain films with peritoneal calcification and dilated bowel loops with air-fluid levels.[5] The small bowel follow-through may be characterized by delayed transit, distension near small bowel adhesions, and a \"cauliflower\" appearance due to peritoneal sclerosis-encapsulated bowel loop compression. Dilated loops of bowel may appear encased in a dense fibrous membrane or matted together and tethered posteriorly on ultrasonography.[48] The appearance of a trilaminar colon wall may be due to intraperitoneal echogenic strands.[49]\nAs of right now, the most extensively researched and widely used imaging method for encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis diagnosis is the CT scan. Small bowel loops are frequently connected by a thickened, encircling peritoneum, which is usually accompanied by proximal bowel dilatation.[49] Increased mesenteric fat density, loculated ascites, and localized or diffuse peritoneal calcification are additional radiographic features.[50][5] Complex loculations may indicate intra-abdominal hemorrhage, but if they contain gas, there is reason to suspect sepsis or a perforation.[51] Elevated thickening or enhancement of the colon wall suggests transmural fibrosis or persistent inflammation.[49] Although it hasn't been used as much for diagnosis, magnetic resonance imaging probably produces similar results. Benefits include better bowel encasement and peritoneal thickening delineation, as well as the avoidance of ionizing radiation.[52]\nThe histologic results for encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis are not specific and can be confused with those for infectious peritonitis or simple peritoneal sclerosis.[53] The mesothelial cell layer is microscopically denuded by fibrin deposition, fibroblast proliferation, and fibrocollagenous deposition. When inflammation is active, there may be an infiltration of inflammatory mononuclear cells.[38] Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis is distinguished from peritoneal sclerosis and peritonitis by the transmembrane glycoprotein podoplanin, which is present on peritoneal mesothelial cells and binds inflammatory cytokines.[54]\nBased on the clinical presentation, encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis is classified into four stages:[5]",
    "Treatment": "Treating the underlying cause of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis is recommended whenever it is feasible. This entails switching from peritoneal dialysis to hemodialysis in the case of peritoneal dialysis.[7]\nThe nutritional status should be evaluated upon encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis diagnosis. Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis cannot be effectively treated with bowel rest or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) alone; however, making sure the patient receives enough nutrition is crucial.[55] Enteral feeding is frequently not tolerated due to obstruction, necessitating TPN.[57]\nMany medications have been used to target the inflammatory component of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis such as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors,[58] cyclosporine,[59] mycophenolate mofetil,[60] colchicine,[61] corticosteroids, and azathioprine.[13][62]\nFor patients who have already experienced significant fibrosis, immunosuppression might not be enough. A potent anti-fibrotic agent, tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that inhibits TGF-β, a crucial cytokine in the fibrosis process.[63]\nBecause encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis surgery is a time-consuming, dangerous, and technical procedure, it should only be performed on patients who have not responded to conservative medical therapy and, if at all possible, in facilities with prior experience performing such procedures.[64][65]",
    "Epidemiology": "Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis occurs between 0.5% and 7.3% of the time worldwide, but in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis for 15 years or longer, the frequency can reach 17.2%.[37] After nine years of peritoneal dialysis, the encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis risk rose to 8% in one study involving over 17,300 patients from Australia, New Zealand, and Scotland; however, when the competing risk of death was considered, the risk dropped to just 1.5%.[68]"

    "Disease": "Endocardial fibroelastosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "EFE is characterized by a thickening of the innermost lining of the heart chambers (the endocardium) due to an increase in the amount of supporting connective tissue and elastic fibres. It is an uncommon cause of unexplained heart failure in infants and children, and is one component of HEC syndrome. Fibroelastosis is strongly seen as a primary cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy in children, along with cardiac amyloidosis, which is more commonly seen in progressive multiple myeloma patients and the elderly.[citation needed]",

    "Diagnosis": "EB can be diagnosed either by a skin (punch) biopsy at the edge of a wound with immunofluorescent mapping, or via blood sample and genetic testing.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Research has focused on changing the mixture of keratins produced in the skin. There are 54 known keratin genes—of which 28 belong to the type I intermediate filament genes and 26 to type II—which work as heterodimers. Many of these genes share substantial structural and functional similarity, but they are specialized to cell type and/or conditions under which they are normally produced. If the balance of production could be shifted away from the mutated, dysfunctional keratin gene toward an intact keratin gene, symptoms could be reduced. For example, sulforaphane, a compound found in broccoli, was found to reduce blistering in a mouse model to the point where affected pups could not be identified visually, when injected into pregnant mice (5 μmol/day = 0.9 mg) and applied topically to newborns (1 μmol/day = 0.2 mg in jojoba oil).[21]\nAs of 2008, clinical research at the University of Minnesota has explored allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for RD and junctional EB, treating a two-year-old child who is one of two brothers with EB. A second transplant has also been performed on the child's older brother. A Missouri boy has also successfully undergone the transplant, as well as a 5 year old boy from Alabama. So far there have been 12 successful transplants.[22] Another transplant is scheduled for a California baby. A clinical trial is planned for 30 subjects.[23] However, the immune suppression that bone marrow transplantation requires causes a risk of serious infections with large scale blisters and skin erosion.[24] Indeed, at least four people have died in the course of either preparation for or institution of bone marrow transplantation for EB, out of only a small group of patients treated so far.[24] The mechanism of action of this therapy is unclear as hematopoietic stem cells are not thought to contribute to epithelial lineages. Rather, it is speculated that cross-correction from tissue-resident graft-derived immune cells contributes to the observed clinical benefit.[25]\nA pilot study performed in 2015 suggests that systemic granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) may promote increased wound healing in people with dystrophic EB.[26] Transplanting skin derived from genetically modified stem cells onto the wound surfaces has been studied with a report of improvements in one person.[27]\nA 2017 clinical trial with male RDEB (recessive dystrophic EB) patients conducted successful grafting of type VII gene corrected keratinocytes (COL7A1 gene correction using retrovirus transduction), without any serious adverse effects. Type VII collage formation was observed at the dermis-epidermis junction in significant amounts.[28]\nA 2020 study demonstrated the safe allogenic grafting of acellular dermal matrix/scaffolds in EB patients without any observed infection or necrosis and instead noted fewer required dressing changes, promoted wound healing, pain reduction, and an overall improvement in the quality of life of the patients.[29]\nIn 2022, a pharmaceutical gel made out of birch bark extract from Betula pendula and Betula pubescens was approved by the European Union as a treatment for epidermolysis bullosa.[30][31]\nThe Epidermolysis Bullosa Disease Activity and Scarring index (EBDASI) is a scoring system that objectively quantifies the severity of EB. The EBDASI is a tool for clinicians and patients to monitor the severity of the disease. It has also been designed to evaluate the response to new therapies for the treatment of EB. The EBDASI was developed and validated by Professor Dedee Murrell and her team of students and fellows at the St George Hospital, University of New South Wales, in Sydney, Australia. It was presented at the International Investigative Dermatology congress in Edinburgh in 2013 and a paper-based version was published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology in 2014.[37]",

    "Causes": "The condition is mostly inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.[6] To a lesser extent, a recessive form exists.[5] It is caused by genetic mutations in the genes encoding the proteins keratin 1 or keratin 10, resulting in disruption of the structure of the epidermis.[6]",

    "Disease": "Epispadias",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Most cases involve a small and bifid penis, which requires surgical closure soon after birth, often including a reconstruction of the urethra. Where it is part of a larger exstrophy, not only the urethra but also the bladder (bladder exstrophy) or the entire perineum (cloacal exstrophy) are open and exposed on birth, requiring closure.[citation needed]\nDespite the similarity of name, an epispadias is not a type of hypospadias, and involves a problem with a different set of embryologic processes.[1]\nWomen can also have this type of congenital malformation.  Epispadias of the female may occur when the urethra develops too far anteriorly, exiting in the clitoris or even more forward.  For females, this may not cause difficulty in urination but may cause problems with sexual satisfaction.  Frequently, the clitoris is bifurcated at the site of urethral exit, and therefore clitoral sensation is less intense during sexual intercourse due to frequent stimulation during urination.  However, with proper stimulation, using either manual or positional techniques, clitoral orgasm is definitely possible.[citation needed]",
    "Causes": "Epispadias is an uncommon and partial form of a spectrum of failures of abdominal and pelvic fusion in the first months of embryogenesis known as the exstrophy - epispadias complex. While epispadias is inherent in all cases of exstrophy it can also, much less frequently, appear in isolation as the least severe form of the complex spectrum. It occurs as a result of defective migration of the genital tubercle primordium to the cloacal membrane, and so malformation of the genital tubercle, at about the 5th week of gestation.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "The main treatment for isolated epispadias is a comprehensive surgical repair of the genito-urinary area usually during the first 7 years of life, including reconstruction of the urethra, closure of the penile shaft and mobilisation of the corpora. The most popular and successful technique is known as the modified Cantwell-Ransley approach. In recent decades however increasing success has been achieved with the complete penile disassembly technique despite its association with greater and more serious risk of damage.[citation needed]",

    "Disease": "Erdheim%E2%80%93Chester disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Erdheim-Chester disease can range from having no symptoms to being fatal, depending on how severe the disease is. It can cause symptoms like bone pain, heart problems, neurological issues, exophthalmos, and constitutional changes in health.[4]\nBone pain is the most common symptom, usually affecting the long bones. The pain is typically mild but constant, occurring close to the joints. Most people with ECD have involvement of the long bones similarly on both sides of the body. More than half of cases also involve other organs, such as the heart, eyes, pituitary gland, brain, and kidneys.[5]\nThe cardiovascular system is the second most affected organ, involved in more than half of reported cases. While periarterial infiltration caused by ECD usually has minimal impact, it can cause increased blood pressure if it affects the renal arteries, which is often treated with subsequent stenting. Other complications include pericardial infiltration causing tamponade, right-sided myocardial infiltration, valve issues requiring replacement, and peri-coronary infiltration, which can lead to fatal heart attacks.[6][7]\nOrbital involvement is also common in ECD, with approximately 25% of patients developing bilateral and symmetrical exophthalmos as the disease progresses.[4] The mass effect from retro-orbital lesions can lead to thickening and twisting of the optic nerves. The lesions may also affect the lacrimal glands, orbital muscles, and retro-orbital fat. Additionally, yellowish periorbital cutaneous xanthomas may develop.[2]\nCentral diabetes insipidus is the most prevalent central nervous system manifestation in ECD. This results from hypothalamic or pituitary infiltration and can also lead to other hormonal disruptions, such as hyperprolactinemia or gonadotropin deficiency.[2][8]\nRenal involvement is seen in approximately 11% of ECD cases, often presenting as obstructive uropathy due to retroperitoneal fibrosis or renal histiocytic infiltration. Symptoms can include abdominal pain, trouble urinating, and kidney problems like swelling or reduced kidney function, which may require dialysis.[6]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis can often be challenging due to several factors, including unclear biopsy findings, the rarity of ECD cases, and the need to distinguish it from Langerhans cell histiocytosis. For these reasons, ECD is often diagnosed based on a combination of clinical symptoms, histology, imaging features, and the presence of mutations in the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways.[9]\nBone biopsy is said to offer the greatest likelihood of reaching a diagnosis. It would appear that approximately half these patients harbor point mutations of the BRAF gene at codon 600 substituting the amino acid glutamine for valine.[8]\nA diagnosis from neurological imaging may not be definitive. The presence of symmetrical cerebellar and pontine signal changes on T2-weighted images seem to be typical of ECD, however, multiple sclerosis and metabolic diseases must also be considered in the differential diagnosis.[10] Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery may be used for diagnostic confirmation and also for therapeutic relief of recurrent pericardial fluid drainage.[11]\nA definitive diagnosis of ECD is made when CD68-positive, CD1a-negative histiocytes are identified in a biopsy specimen.[2] ECD is marked by the buildup of foamy histiocytes and occasional Touton giant cells in a fibrous tissue background. Tissue samples show xanthomatous or xanthogranulomatous infiltration by lipid-laden histiocytes.[8] Lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates may be present but are usually sparse. The histiocytes in ECD typically show similar markers to reactive histiocytes, except when the BRAF V600E mutation is found. Classic signs, like foamy histiocytes, may not always be visible and could instead show general inflammation and fibrosis.[9]\nImmunohistochemical staining (IHC) can assist in diagnosing and classifying ECD versus other histiocytic neoplasms such as LCH. Using BRAF V600E-specific antibodies in IHC testing provides high accuracy for diagnosing the former.[9] Unlike LCH, ECD does not stain positive for S-100 proteins or Group 1 CD1a glycoproteins, and electron microscopy of cell cytoplasm does not disclose Birbeck granules.[8] More sensitive methods like pyrosequencing or digital droplet polymerase chain reaction may be helpful if aforementioned methods return with inconclusive results.",
    "Treatment": "There are two FDA-approved targeted drugs to treat ECD.\nOther treatment options include:\nAs there is no definitive cure, treatment should also focus on extending life and enhancing quality of life. Psychological support is important, as effective physical treatment often leads to a chronic condition, which may involve various challenges, deficits, and secondary complications.[17]",
    "Prognosis": "Erdheim–Chester disease was previously associated with high mortality rates.[18] However, long-term survival is now more promising. Recent studies have reported that some patients receiving targeted therapies showed no disease progression. Targeted therapies using BRAF, MEK and/or other inhibitors have been dramatically efficacious.[12][16][19][20] In 2019, the Mayo Clinic released guidelines for diagnosing and treating the disease, emphasizing the importance of genetic testing. Recent research findings on the disease's genomic structure, especially mutations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway, have enabled the use of targeted therapies for most patients.[9]",
    "Epidemiology": "Approximately 1500 cases had been reported in the literature as of 2020.[21] ECD affects predominantly adults, with a mean age of 53 years.[8] Cases in children are very rare, with fewer than 20 reported as of 2022. No variations in clinical presentation, imaging, histopathology, or treatment response based on gender or race have been observed.[4]",
    "Society and culture": "The Erdheim–Chester Disease Global Alliance is a support and advocacy group with the goal of raising awareness of and promoting research into ECD.[24][25] ECD families and patients are also supported by the Histiocytosis Association, Inc.[25][26]\nIn the TV show House, season 2 episode 17, \"All In\", the initial and final diagnosis of a 6-year-old boy who presents with bloody diarrhea and ataxia is Erdheim–Chester disease.[27]"

    "Disease": "Erythromelalgia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The most prominent symptoms of erythromelalgia are episodes of erythema, swelling, a painful deep-aching of the soft tissue (usually either radiating or shooting) and tenderness, along with a painful burning sensation primarily in the extremities. These symptoms are often symmetric and affect the lower extremities more frequently than the upper extremities. Symptoms may also affect the ears and face. For secondary erythromelalgia, attacks typically precede and are precipitated by the underlying primary condition. For primary erythromelalgia, attacks can last from an hour to months at a time and occur infrequently to frequently with multiple times daily. Attacks most frequently occur at night, thus having the potential to greatly interfere with sleep. Common triggers for daytime episodes are exertion, heating of the affected extremities, and alcohol or caffeine consumption, and any pressure applied to the limbs. In some patients sugar and even melon consumption have also been known to provoke attacks. Many of those with primary erythromelalgia avoid wearing shoes or socks as the heat this generates is known to produce erythromelalgia attacks.[9] The coexistence of erythromelalgia and Raynaud's phenomenon is rare, but case studies of patients with both diagnoses have been reported in medical journals.[17] Symptoms may present gradually and incrementally, sometimes taking years to become intense enough for patients to seek medical care.  In other cases symptoms emerge full blown with onset.[citation needed]\nEpidemic erythromelalgia is characterized by burning pain in the toes and soles of the feet, accompanied by foot redness, congestion, and edema; a few patients may have fever, palpitations, headache, and joint pain. In the 1987 epidemic in Hubei, 60.6% of patients had a common cold before the onset of erythromelalgia and 91.2% had pharyngitis.[13]",
    "Causes": "In general, erythromelalgia seems to consist of neuropathological and microvascular alterations. How this occurs in secondary erythromelalgia is poorly understood and may be specific to the underlying primary condition. Primary conditions that have been shown to elicit erythromelalgia are listed in diagnosis, below.[9]\nPrimary erythromelalgia is a better understood autosomal dominant disorder. The neuropathological symptoms of primary erythromelalgia arise from hyperexcitability of C-fibers in the dorsal root ganglion. Specifically, nociceptors (neurons responsible for the sensation and conduction of painful stimuli) appear to be the primarily affected neurons in these fibers. This hyperexcitability results in the severe burning pain experienced by patients. While the neuropathological symptoms are a result of hyperexcitability, microvascular alterations in erythromelalgia are due to hypoexcitability. The sympathetic nervous system controls cutaneous vascular tone and altered response of this system to stimuli such as heat likely results in the observed microvascular symptoms. In both cases, these changes in excitability are typically due to mutation of the sodium channel NaV1.7. These differences in excitability alterations between the sympathetic nervous system and nociceptors is due to different expression of sodium channels other than NaV1.7 in them.[9]\nWhat causes epidemic erythromelalgia in southern China remains unknown although several erythromelalgia-associated poxviruses were isolated from throat swabs of several patients at different counties and from two different seasons.[18][19][20]\nSeveral medications, including verapamil and nifedipine, as well as ergot derivatives such as bromocriptine and pergolide, have been associated with medication-induced erythromelalgia.[citation needed]\nThe consumption of two species of related fungi, Clitocybe acromelalga from Japan,[21] and Clitocybe amoenolens from France,[22] has led to several cases of mushroom-induced erythromelalgia which lasted from 8 days to 5 months.[23]\nAn epidemic form of this syndrome occurs in secondary school students in rural areas of China. A large epidemic erythromelalgia was occurred in Hubei province of China in 1987 and the disease was characterized by burning pain in the toes and soles of the feet, accompanied by foot redness, congestion, and edema; a few patients had fever, palpitations, headache, and joint pain. 60.6% of patients had a common cold before the onset of erythromelalgia and 91.2% had pharyngitis.[13] Subsequently, a virus - erythromelalgia-related poxvirus (ERPV) - was repeatedly isolated from throat swabs of six separate patients from two different counties and Wuhan city in Hubei province.[18][19][20] The genome of this virus has been sequenced and it appears that this virus is related to a strain of mousepox.[24] Serological characterization can easily distinguish human ERPV from ectromelia virus and vaccinia virus by cross-neutralization and plaque reduction assays [19]\nSince this virus has not yet been isolated from other outbreaks in other parts of southern China to date this putative association needs to be further investigated. The finding of the specific antibody conversion to ATIs of ERPV in patients' paired sera strengthens the evidence for a possible aetiological role of human ERPV in epidemic erythromelalgia.[25]",
    "Diagnosis": "Erythromelalgia is a difficult condition to diagnose as there are no specific tests available. However, reduced capillary density has been observed microscopically during flaring;[39] and reduced capillary perfusion is noted in the patient. Another test that can be done is to have the patient elevate their legs, and note the reversal (from red to pale) in skin color. Tests done at universities include quantitative sensory nerve testing, laser evoked potentials, sweat testing and epidermal sensory nerve fiber density test (which is an objective test for small fiber sensory neuropathy).[40] Due to the aforementioned factors, patients may face delays in diagnosis.[41]\nOnce it has been established that it is not secondary erythromelalgia — see below — a programme of management can be put in place. Some diseases present with symptoms similar to erythromelalgia. Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), for instance, presents with severe burning pain and redness except these symptoms are often unilateral (versus symmetric) and may be proximal instead of purely or primarily distal. Furthermore, attacks triggered by heat and resolved by cooling are less common with CRPS.[citation needed]\nErythromelalgia is sometimes caused by other disorders. A partial list of diseases known to precipitate erythromelalgia is below.[9]",
    "Treatment": "For secondary erythromelalgia, treatment of the underlying primary disorder is the most primary method of treatment. Although aspirin has been thought to reduce symptoms of erythromelalgia, it is rare to find evidence that this is effective. Mechanical cooling of the limbs by elevating them can help or managing the ambient environment frequently is often necessary constantly as flares occur due to sympathetic autonomic dysfunction of the capillaries. The pain that accompanies it is severe and treated separately (the pain is similar to CRPS, phantom limb or thalamic pain syndrome). Patients are strongly advised not to place the affected limbs in cold water to relieve symptoms when flaring occurs. It may seem a good idea, but it precipitates problems further down the line causing damage to the skin and ulceration often intractable due to the damaged skin.  A possible reduction in skin damage may be accomplished by enclosing the flaring limb in a commonly available, thin, heat transparent, water impermeable, plastic food storage bag.  The advice of a physician is advised depending on specific circumstances.[citation needed]\nPrimary erythromelalgia management is symptomatic, i.e. treating painful symptoms only. Specific management tactics include avoidance of attack triggers such as: heat, change in temperature, exercise or over exertion, alcohol and spicy foods. This list is by no means comprehensive as there are many triggers to set off a 'flaring' episode that are inexplicable. Whilst a cool environment is helpful in keeping the symptoms in control, the use of cold water baths is strongly discouraged. In pursuit of added relief sufferers can inadvertently cause tissue damage or death, i.e. necrosis.[citation needed] See comments at the end of the preceding paragraph regarding possible effectiveness of plastic food storage bags to avoid/reduce negative effects of submersion in cold water baths.[citation needed]\nOne clinical study has demonstrated the efficacy of IV lidocaine or oral mexilitine, though differences between the primary and secondary forms were not studied. Another trial has shown promise for misoprostol, while other have shown that gabapentin, venlafaxine and oral magnesium may also be effective,[9] but no further testing was carried out as newer research superseded this combination.[citation needed]\nStrong anecdotal evidence from EM patients shows that a combination of drugs such as duloxetine and pregabalin is an effective way of reducing the stabbing pains and burning sensation symptoms of erythromelalgia in conjunction with the appropriate analgesia.[citation needed] In some cases, antihistamines may give some relief. Most people with erythromelalgia  never go into remission and the symptoms are ever present at some level, whilst others get worse, or the EM is eventually a symptom of another disease such as systemic scleroderma.[citation needed]\nSome suffering with EM are prescribed ketamine topical creams as a way of managing pain on a long-term basis.[42] Feedback from some EM patients has led to reduction in usage as they believe it is only effective for short periods. Living with erythromelalgia can result in a deterioration in quality of life resulting in the inability to function in a work place, lack of mobility, depression, and is socially alienating; much greater education of medical practitioners is needed. As with many rare diseases, many people with EM end up taking years to get a diagnosis and to receive appropriate treatment. Research into the genetic mutations continues but there is a paucity of clinical studies focusing on living with erythromelalgia. There is much urgency within pharmaceutical companies to provide a solution to those who suffer with pain such as that with erythromelalgia.[citation needed]\nPatients find relief by cooling the skin. All patients must be notified to not apply ice directly on to the skin, since this can cause maceration of the skin, nonhealing ulcers, infection, necrosis, and even amputation in severe cases.[43]\nMild sufferers may find sufficient pain relief with tramadol or amitriptyline. Sufferers of more severe and widespread EM symptoms, however, may obtain relief only from opioid drugs. Opana ER has been found to be effective for many in the US, whilst in the UK slow-release morphine has proved to be effective. These powerful and potentially-addictive drugs may be prescribed to patients only after they have tried almost every other type of analgesia to no avail. (This delay in appropriate pain management can be a result of insurer-mandated or legally-required step therapy, or merely overly-cautious prescribing on the part of sufferers' doctors.)[citation needed]\nThe combination of Cymbalta (duloxetine) and Lyrica (pregabalin) has also proven to be useful in controlling pain, but many EM patients have found this combination has side effects that they are unable to tolerate.[citation needed]",
    "Epidemiology": "Only a small number of studies that have investigated the prevalence of EM, with four studies conducted to date.[44]\nThe mean of all the studies combined results in an EM estimation incidence of 4.7/100,000 with a mean of 1 : 3.7 of the male to female ratio, respectively.[44][45]\nIn 1997 there was a study conducted in Norway that estimated that the annual incidence of 2/100,000, with a 1 : 2.4 male to female ratio in this study\npopulation, respectively.[46] In 2009 there was a population-based study of EM in the USA (Olmsted County, Minnesota), that reported that the annual incidence was 1.3/100,000, with a 1 : 5.6 male to female ratio in this study population, respectively.[47]\nThe incidence in this study of primary and secondary EM was 1.1 : 0.2 per 100 000 people per year, respectively.[47]\nA study of a single centre in the south of Sweden in 2012, showed the overall annual population-based incidence was 0.36/100,000.[48]\nIn New Zealand (Dunedin) a study estimated that in 2013 the incidence of EM is 15/100,000, with a 1 : 3 male to female ratio in this study\npopulation, respectively.[45] This last study has an estimation that is at least ten times higher than the prevalence previously reported. This study recruited individuals based on self-identification of symptoms (after self-identification, patients were invited for an assessment of an EM diagnosis), instead of participants that are identified through secondary and tertiary referrals as in the other studies.[45]\nThere was a study done in 2013 where two Vietnamese patients were diagnosed with primary erythromelalgia. Patient A was a 33-year old female diagnosed with primary erythromelalgia at age 30 and suffered from burning and pain in her feet since she was 8 years old (Wu et. al 2013). Patient B was a 16 year-old girl with recurrent severe burning pain of both feet since the age of seven (Wu et. al 2013). A genetic analysis was performed where scientists observed three missense mutations, one familial and two sporadic mutations. The familial mutation changed isoleucine to valine and two missense mutations occurred where a \"T\" was changed to \"C\" (Wu et. al 2013). The three mutants involved in the gene were I136V, 1848T, and V1316A (Wu et. al 2013). The study showed that at higher temperatures, the hypersensitivity of the mutant channels were accentuated resulting in disease phenotype such as neuralgia (Wu et. al 2013).\nEpidemic EM appears quite common in female middle school students of southern China, most likely due to a sharp decline in temperature following by a rapid increase of temperature.[44] It has been postulated that epidemic erythromelalgia might be related to a poxvirus (ERPV) infection. The disease was characterized by burning pain in the toes and soles of the feet, accompanied by foot redness, congestion, and edema; a few patients had fever, palpitations, headache, and joint pain. 60.6% of patients had a common cold before the onset of erythromelalgia and 91.2% had pharyngitis.[13][18][19][20] For temperature-related theory, the acral (foot and hand) small superficial arteries intensely constrict and dilate during the sharp decline of temperature, whereas a sharp increase of temperature, the intense expansion of capillaries irritate the nerve endings around, and thus lead to syndromes including (first and second degree) burning pain, increased temperature, erythema and swelling.[44]"

    "Disease": "Ewing sarcoma",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Ewing sarcoma is more common in males (1.6 male:1 female) and usually presents in childhood or early adulthood, with a peak between 10 and 20 years of age. It can occur anywhere in the body but most commonly in the pelvis and proximal long tubular bones, especially around the growth plates. The diaphyses of the femur are the most common sites, followed by the tibia and the humerus. Thirty percent are overtly metastatic at presentation, while 10–15% of people present with a pathologic fracture at the time of diagnosis.[10] People usually experience extreme bone pain. Rarely, the tumor presents as extraskeletal, or outside the bone, such as in the vagina, pleura, or otherwise.[11][12][13]\nSigns and symptoms include intermittent fevers, anemia, leukocytosis, increased sedimentation rate, and other symptoms of inflammatory systemic illness.[14]\nAccording to the Bone Cancer Research Trust (BCRT), the most common symptoms are localized pain, swelling, and sporadic bone pain with variable intensity. The swelling is most likely to be visible if the sarcoma is located on a bone near the surface of the body, but when it occurs in other places deeper in the body, like on the pelvis, it may not be visible.[15]",
    "Diagnosis": "The definitive diagnosis is based on histomorphologic findings, immunohistochemistry and molecular pathology.\nEwing sarcoma is a small-blue-round-cell tumor that typically has a clear cytoplasm on H&E staining, due to glycogen.  The presence of the glycogen can be demonstrated with positive PAS staining and negative PAS diastase staining.  The characteristic immunostain is CD99, which diffusely marks the cell membrane. However, as CD99 is not specific for Ewing sarcoma, several auxiliary immunohistochemical markers can be employed to support the histological diagnosis.[23]  Morphologic and immunohistochemical findings are corroborated with an associated chromosomal translocation, of which several occur.  The most common translocation, present in about 90% of Ewing sarcoma cases, is t(11;22)(q24;q12),[24][25] which generates an aberrant transcription factor through fusion of the EWSR1 gene with the FLI1 gene.[26]\nThe pathologic differential diagnosis is the grouping of small-blue-round-cell tumors, which includes lymphoma, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, and desmoplastic small round cell tumor, among others.[citation needed]\nOn conventional radiographs, typical findings of Ewing sarcoma consist of multiple confluent lytic bone lesions that have a \"moth eaten\" pattern due to permeative destruction of bone.[10] There will also be a displaced periosteum as the new sub-periosteal layer of bone begins to grow on top of the tumor. This raised or displaced periosteum is consistent with the classic radiographic finding of the Codman triangle.[10] The proliferative reaction of bone can also create delicate laminations constituting the periosteal layers and giving the radiographic appearance of an onion peel.[10] Plain films add valuable information in the initial evaluation or screening. The wide zone of transition (e.g. permeative) is the most useful plain film characteristic in differentiation of benign versus aggressive or malignant lytic lesions.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be routinely used in the work-up of malignant tumors. It will show the full bony and soft tissue extent and relate the tumor to other nearby anatomic structures (e.g. vessels). Gadolinium contrast is not necessary as it does not give additional information over noncontrast studies, though some current researchers argue that dynamic, contrast-enhanced MRI may help determine the amount of necrosis within the tumor, thus help in determining response to treatment prior to surgery.[27]\nComputed axial tomography (CT) can also be used to define the extraosseous extent of the tumor, especially in the skull, spine, ribs, and pelvis. Both CT and MRI can be used to follow response to radiation and/or chemotherapy. Bone scintigraphy can also be used to follow tumor response to therapy.[27]\nIn the group of malignant small round cell tumors that includes Ewing sarcoma, bone lymphoma, and small cell osteosarcoma, the cortex may appear almost normal radiographically, while permeative growth occurs throughout the Haversian channels. These tumors may be accompanied by a large soft-tissue mass while almost no bone destruction is visible.  The radiographs frequently do not show any signs of cortical destruction.\nRadiographically, Ewing sarcoma presents as \"moth-eaten\" destructive radiolucencies of the medulla and erosion of the cortex with expansion.[27]\nOther entities with similar clinical presentations include osteomyelitis, osteosarcoma (especially telangiectatic osteosarcoma), and eosinophilic granuloma. Soft-tissue neoplasms such as pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma (malignant fibrous histiocytoma) that erode into adjacent bone may also have a similar appearance. Accumulating evidence suggests that EWSR1-NFATc2 positive sarcomas, which were previously considered to possibly belong to the Ewing family of tumors, differ from Ewing sarcoma in their genetics, transcriptomes, and epigenetic and epidemiological profiles, indicating that they might represent a distinct tumor entity.[28][29][30][31]",
    "Treatment": "Almost all people receive multidrug chemotherapy (most often vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, and etoposide),[32] as well as local disease control with surgery and/or radiation.[33] An aggressive approach is necessary because almost all people with apparently localized disease at the time of diagnosis actually have asymptomatic metastatic disease.[citation needed]\nThe surgical resection may involve limb salvage or amputation. Complete excision at the time of biopsy may be performed if malignancy is confirmed at the time it is examined.[citation needed] Treatment lengths vary depending on location and stage of the disease at diagnosis. Radical chemotherapy may be as short as six treatments at three-week cycles, but most people undergo chemotherapy for 6–12 months and radiation therapy for 5–8 weeks.[citation needed] Radiotherapy has been used for localized disease. The tumor has a unique property of being highly sensitive to radiation, sometimes acknowledged by the phrase \"melting like snow\", but the main drawback is that it recurs dramatically after some time.[citation needed]\nAntisense oligodeoxynucleotides have been proposed as possible treatment by down-regulating the expression of the oncogenic fusion protein associated with the development of Ewing sarcoma resulting from the EWS-ETS gene translocation.[34][35] In addition, the synthetic retinoid derivative fenretinide (4-hydroxy(phenyl)retinamide) has been reported to induce high levels of cell death in Ewing sarcoma cell lines in vitro and to delay growth of xenografts in in vivo mouse models.[36][37]\nIn most pediatric cancers including sarcoma, proton beam radiation (also known as proton therapy) delivers an equally effective dose to the tumor with less damage to the surrounding normal tissue compared to photon radiation.[38]",
    "Prognosis": "Staging attempts to distinguish people with localized from those with metastatic disease.[39] The most common areas of metastasis are the lungs, bone and bone marrow with less common areas of metastasis being the lymph nodes, liver, and brain.[10] The presence of metastatic disease is the most important prognostic factor in Ewing sarcoma, with the 5-year survival rate being only 30% when metastasis is present at the time of diagnosis, compared to a 70% 5-year survival rate with no metastasis present.[10] Another important prognostic factor is the location of the primary tumor; proximal tumors (located in the pelvis and sacrum) are worse prognostic indicators as compared to more distal tumors.[10] Other factors associated with a poor prognosis include a large primary neoplasm, older age at diagnosis (older than 18 years of age), and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels.[10]\nFive-year survival for localized disease is greater than 70% after therapy.[40] Prior to the use of multi-drug chemotherapy, long-term survival was less than 10%. The development of multi-disciplinary therapy with chemotherapy, irradiation, and surgery has increased current long-term survival rates in most clinical centers to greater than 50%.[41] However, some sources state it is 25–30%.[42]\nRetrospective research showed that two chemokine receptors, CXCR4 and CXCR7, can be used as molecular prognosis factors. People who express low levels of both chemokine receptors have the highest odds of long-term survival with >90% survival at five years post-diagnosis versus <30% survival at five years for patients with very high expression levels of both receptors.[43] A recent study also suggested a role for SOX2 as an independent prognostic biomarker that can be used to identify patients at high risk for tumor relapse.[44]",
    "Epidemiology": "Ewing sarcomas represent 16% of primary bone sarcomas.[14] In the United States, they are most common in the second decade of life,[14] with a rate of 0.3 cases per million in children under 3 years of age, and as high as 4.6 cases per million in adolescents aged 15–19 years. Nearly 80% of patients are aged less than 20 years of age.[45] It is uncommon in patients younger than 5 years and older than 30 years.[45]\nInternationally, the annual incidence rate averages less than 2 cases per million children.[46] In the United Kingdom, an average of six children per year are diagnosed; mainly males in early stages of puberty. With occurrences primarily arising in older children and teenagers, one causal theory is puberty, e.g. its rapid growth spurts making bone tissue more cancer susceptible during development years.[47]\nA grouping of three unrelated teenagers in Wake Forest, North Carolina, have been diagnosed with Ewing sarcoma. All three children were diagnosed in 2011 and all attended the same temporary classroom together while the school underwent renovation. A fourth teenager living nearby was diagnosed in 2009. The odds of this grouping are considered significant.[48] Ewing sarcoma occurs about 10- to 20-fold more commonly in people of European descent compared to people of African descent.[49][10]\nEwing sarcoma is the second most common bone cancer in children and adolescents, with poor prognosis and outcome in ~70% of initial diagnoses and 10–15% of relapses.[50]"

    "Disease": "Extramammary Paget%27s disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Patients with EMPD present with typical symptoms, similar to MPD,[3] such as severe itchiness (also called pruritus), rash, plaque formation, burning sensation, pain and tenderness.[7] These symptoms are often confused for dermatitis or eczema.[8] 10% of patients are asymptomatic resulting in delayed diagnosis.[7] In rare cases bleeding can also be seen.[9]\nSymptoms of extramammary Paget's disease[7]\nSkin -\nDischarge -\nSensation -\nDisease of the vulva\nVulvar Paget's disease affect women and presents as erythematous (red), eczematous lesions.[10] It is itchy and sometimes pain can be associated with the affected area.[10] The lesion is clearly separated from normal skin in most cases, and sometimes scattered areas of white scale can be present, giving a \"strawberries and cream\" appearance.[11]\nInvolvement may be extensive including the perianal region, genitocrural, and inguinal folds. Clinical examination should determine the presence of periurethral and perianal lesions.[12] In these cases an involvement of the skin by a noncutaneous internal neoplasm may occur.[12]",
    "Diagnosis": "Due to the rarity of EMPD and lack of clinical knowledge, the disease is not very commonly diagnosed.[8] Patients are often misdiagnosed with eczema or dermatitis[8] and a delay of 2 years is expected from the onset of symptoms before a definitive diagnosis has been reached.[8]\nIt is important to include that the lesion is associated with another cancer. A biopsy will establish the diagnosis. Punch biopsies are not effective in differentially diagnosing for EMPD and as a result, excisional biopsies of the affected area are taken [XX]. A positive test result for EMPD shows increased numbers of large polygonal cells with a pale bluish cytoplasm, large nucleus and nucleolus, infiltrating the epidermal layer.[7] These neoplastic cells can be found singly scattered or can appear in groups called nests.[7]\nPaget cells contain mucin and cytokeratins which can be used in the diagnosis of EMPD [8] MUC5A2 is found in EMPD of the vulvar and male genitalia regions whereas MUC2 is expressed in perianal EMPD. Loss of MUC5A2 can indicate an invasive spread.[15] Immunohistochemistry (IHC) can be used to determine whether EMPD is either primary or secondary.[15] Primary EMPD tests positive for CK7 but negative for CK20, whereas secondary is positive for both.[15] Lack of positivity for hormone receptors and HER2 protein is overexpressed meaning that the cells are dividing rapidly and can be indicate an aggressive and more recurrent disease.[citation needed]\nPrimary EMPD is of cutaneous origins and is found within the epidermis or the underlying apocrine glands.[1] Although it is limited to the epithelium, it has potential to spread and progress into an invasive tumour, metastasising to the local lymph nodes and distant organs.[6] This form of EMPD is not associated with an adenocarcinoma.[1]\nThe secondary form results due to an underlying adenocarcinoma spreading to the epidermis.[15] Similar to the primary form, if secondary EMPD invades the dermis, the neoplastic cells can metastasise to the lymph nodes and in some cases, the dermis.[4]\nAccording to the Wilkinson and Brown subclassification system, there are three subtypes for each classification.[16]",
    "Treatment": "Many chemotherapy treatments have been used, however the results are not desirable as prognosis remains to be poor.[16] Surgery remains to be the preferred treatment of choice. Wide local excision with a 3 cm margin and intra-operative frozen sections are suggested, due to high risk of local extension despite normal appearing tissue. In cases where Paget cells have invaded the dermis and metastasized, complete removal is often unsuccessful. Recurrence is a common result.[15] Lymphadenoectomy is often performed for infiltrative cases.[16] In lieu of surgery, radiotherapy is also an option and is especially preferred for elderly patients or for inoperable cases where the tumour size is too large.[6]  This form of treatment is also considered as possible adjuvant therapy following excision to combat the high recurrence rate.[2] However, there are side effects of radiotherapy, including but not limited to: vulvitis, post-radiation atrophy of mucous membranes, vaginal stenosis and sexual dysfunction.[2]\nLaser therapy and photodynamic therapies were also used in the past, but it was discovered the carbon dioxide laser did not penetrate deep enough and both treatment modalities resulted in high recurrence rates.[2]\nTopical chemotherapy treatments are effective, with imiquimod showing promising results.[2] However, overall survival begins to decline 10 months following treatment with chemotherapy.[4] Patients with metastatic EMPD only survive for a median of 1.5 years, and have a 7% 5-year survival rate.[4]",
    "Prognosis": "Prognosis is generally good, but factors such as depth of invasion and duration of disease need to be considered.[16] In primary EMPD, if invasion of the underlying tissue is non-existent or even minimal, treatment options are more likely to be effective, however, if there are signs that the disease has metastasised, the prognosis is usually poor.[3]",
    "Epidemiology": "EMPD is most prevalent in Caucasian women and Asian men over the age of 60.[9]  The invasive form occurs in 5–25% of all EMPD patients and 17–30% of the cases involve an underlying adenocarcinoma.[16] 10-20% of EMPD is of the secondary form.[16]  Approximately 10% of patients develop invasive adenocarcinoma that may progress to metastatic disease.[17]\nThe disease affects regions that are rich in apocrine secretions.[4] 65% EMPD occurs at the vulva,[15] followed by 15% at perianal areas and 14% at the male genitalia.[2]  In terms of the vulva, the labia majora is the site that is most often involved, followed by labia minora, clitoris and perineum.[16] EMPD originating at the vulva can spread to the upper vaginal mucosa and cervix.[16] Other areas where EMPD can be found, although very rarely, include: the axillae, eyelids, external auditory canal, umbilical region, trunk and extremities.[2]"

    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is by medical imaging, with MRI being more accurate than CT scan, and confirmed by CT-guided or ultrasound-guided core-needle biopsy once a chest CT has excluded spread to lungs.[2] Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography is more accurate than a bone scan in detecting spread, and can be used to monitor response to treatment.[2]",

Manifestations of the disease usually increase in number and severity as an individual ages.[5]\nFull-body or localized pain to the extremities (known as acroparesthesia) or gastrointestinal (GI) tract is common in patients with Fabry disease. This pain can increase over time. This acroparesthesia is believed to be related to the damage of peripheral nerve fibers that transmit pain. Gastrointestinal tract pain is likely caused by the accumulation of lipids in the small vasculature of the GI tract, which obstructs blood flow and causes pain.[6]\nKidney complications are common and serious effects of the disease; chronic kidney disease and kidney failure may worsen throughout life. The presence of protein in the urine (which causes foamy urine) is often the first sign of kidney involvement. End-stage kidney failure in those with Fabry disease typically occurs in the third decade of life and is a common cause of death due to the disease.[citation needed]\nFabry disease can affect the heart in several ways.  The accumulation of sphingolipids within heart muscle cells causes an abnormal thickening of the heart muscle or hypertrophy.  This hypertrophy can cause the heart muscle to become abnormally stiff and unable to relax, leading to a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy causing shortness of breath.[7][8]\nFabry disease can also affect how the heart conducts electrical impulses, leading to both abnormally slow heart rhythms such as complete heart block, and abnormally rapid heart rhythms such as ventricular tachycardia.  These abnormal heart rhythms can cause blackouts, palpitations, or even sudden cardiac death.[7][8]\nSphingolipids can also build up within the heart valves, thickening the valves and affecting the way they open and close. If severe, this can cause the valves to leak (regurgitation) or restrict the forward flow of blood (stenosis).  The aortic and mitral valves are more commonly affected than the valves on the right side of the heart.[7][8]\nAngiokeratomas (tiny, painless papules that can appear on any region of the body, but are predominant on the thighs, around the navel, buttocks, lower abdomen, and groin) are common.[9]\nAnhidrosis (lack of sweating) is a common symptom, and less commonly hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating).[citation needed]\nAdditionally, patients can exhibit Raynaud's disease-like symptoms with neuropathy (in particular, burning extremity pain).[citation needed]\nOcular involvement may be present showing cornea verticillata (also known as vortex keratopathy), i.e. clouding of the corneas. Keratopathy may be the presenting feature in asymptomatic patients and must be differentiated from other causes of vortex keratopathy (e.g. drug deposition in the cornea).[10] This clouding does not affect vision.[10]\nOther ocular findings can include conjunctival and retinal vascular abnormalities and anterior/posterior spoke-like cataracts. Visual reduction from these manifestations is uncommon.[citation needed]\nFatigue, neuropathy (in particular, burning extremity pain, red hands and feet on and off), cerebrovascular effects leading to an increased risk of stroke - early strokes, mostly vertebrobasilar system tinnitus (ringing in the ears), vertigo, nausea, inability to gain weight, chemical imbalances, and diarrhea are other common symptoms.[citation needed]",
    "Causes": "Fabry disease is caused by a mutation in the DNA sequence of the GLA gene. A person who inherits this mutation does not have enough of a functioning enzyme known as alpha-galactosidase A. The lack of alpha-galactosidase leads to Fabry disease. A deficiency of alpha-galactosidase A (a-GAL A, encoded by GLA) due to mutation causes a glycolipid known as globotriaosylceramide (abbreviated as Gb3, GL-3, or ceramide trihexoside) to accumulate within the blood vessels, other tissues, and organs.[11] This accumulation leads to an impairment of their proper functions.[citation needed]\nAt least 443 disease-causing mutations in the GLA gene have been discovered.[12] The DNA mutations that cause the disease are X-linked recessive with incomplete penetrance in heterozygous females. The condition affects hemizygous males (i.e. all non-intersex males), as well as homozygous, and in many cases heterozygous females. While males typically experience severe symptoms, women can range from being asymptomatic to having severe symptoms.  Research suggests many women experience severe symptoms ranging from early cataracts or strokes to hypertrophic left ventricular heart problems and kidney failure.  This variability is thought to be due to X-inactivation patterns during embryonic development of the female.[13]",
    "Diagnosis": "Fabry disease is suspected based on the individual's clinical presentation and can be diagnosed by an enzyme assay (usually done on leukocytes) to measure the level of alpha-galactosidase activity.  An enzyme assay is not reliable for the diagnosis of disease in females due to the random nature of X-inactivation. Molecular genetic analysis of the GLA gene is the most accurate method of diagnosis in females, particularly if the mutations have already been identified in male family members.  Many disease-causing mutations have been noted. Kidney biopsy may also be suggestive of Fabry disease if excessive lipid buildup is noted. Pediatricians, as well as internists, commonly misdiagnose Fabry disease.[16] All immediate and extended family members in the same family have the same family mutation, so if one member of a family has a DNA sequence analysis performed, other members of the family can be diagnosed by performing a targeted sequence analysis instead of testing the entire gene.[17] Targeted sequencing is quicker and less expensive to perform. One study reported that for every first diagnosis in a family, on average five more family members (immediate and extended) are also diagnosed.[17]\nMRI is accurate in accessing left ventricular mass and thickness and hypertrophy. Late gadolinium enhancement shows an increased signal of the mid wall at the inferolateral wall of the base of the left ventricle, usually in the non-hypertrophic ventricle. T1-weighted imaging can show low T1 signal due to sphingolipid storage in the heart even without ventricular hypertrophy in 40% of those affected by the disease. Thus, MRI is a useful way of diagnosing the disease early.[18] T2 signal is increased in inflammation and oedema.[19]",
    "Treatment": "The treatments available for Fabry disease can be divided into therapies that aim to correct the underlying problem of decreased activity of the alpha-galactosidase A enzyme and thereby reduce the risk of organ damage, and therapies to improve symptoms and life expectancy once organ damage has already occurred.[citation needed]\nPain associated with Fabry disease may be partially alleviated by enzyme replacement therapy in some patients, but pain management regimens may also include analgesics, anticonvulsants, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, though the latter are usually best avoided in kidney disease.  The kidney failure seen in some of those with Fabry disease sometimes requires haemodialysis. The cardiac complications of Fabry disease include abnormal heart rhythms, which may require a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, while the restrictive cardiomyopathy often seen may require diuretics.[20]",
    "Prognosis": "Life expectancy with Fabry disease for males was 58.2 years, compared with 74.7 years in the general population, and for females 75.4 years compared with 80.0 years in the general population, according to registry data from 2001 to 2008. The most common cause of death was cardiovascular disease, and most of those had received kidney replacements.[46]",
    "Epidemiology": "Fabry disease is panethnic, but due to its rarity, determining an accurate disease frequency is difficult.[15] Reported incidences, ranging from 1-5:10,000 in the general population, may largely underestimate the true prevalence.[15] Newborn screening initiatives have found an unexpectedly high prevalence of the disease, as high as one in about 3,100 newborns in Italy, and have identified a surprisingly high frequency of newborn males around one in 1,500 in Taiwan.[15]"

    "Disease": "Facial onset sensory and motor neuronopathy",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The sensory symptoms in FOSM start in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve with paresthesias and numbness and characteristically spread from the head to lower parts of the body; involving the scalp, neck, shoulders and upper extremities. The lower extremities are sometimes also affected.[6] The trigeminal involvement may be unilateral or bilateral at onset.[6] Lower motor neuron involvement may start at the same time as sensory involvement or soon afterwards and also spreads in a head to lower body sequence.[6] Bulbar symptoms due to involvement of the cranial nerves are very common; which often leads to difficulties with swallowing or respirations. This may necessitate placement of a feeding tube or non-invasive ventilation.[6] Lower motor neuron symptoms commonly seen in FOSMN commonly include weakness, fasciculations, difficulties with speech and trouble swallowing.[6] Whereas lower motor neuron signs is observed in all cases of FOSMN, upper motor neuron associated weakness, which presents as brisk reflexes sometimes with clonus and a positive Babinski Sign, is also seen but is less common.[6] In approximately 50% of cases symptoms are initially asymmetric; affecting one side of the body, with eventual progression to the other side. In cases of asymmetric spread; the initially affected side may have more severe symptoms.[6] Although most features of FOSMN reflect lower motor neuron impairment some findings have suggested upper motor neuron impairment in FOSMN.[6]\nFrontotemporal dementia, including the behavioral variant, is a co-morbid condition associated with FOSMN.[6]",
    "Causes": "The etiology of FOSMN is unknown but it is thought to involve a neurodegenerative or autoimmune process.[6] Some people with FOSMN were positive for various auto-antibodies and others had partial symptom improvement in response to various immunotherapies suggesting a possible autoimmune pathophysiology.[6] Abnormal TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) deposits were found on autopsy in the nerves of some with FOSMN. Abnormal TDP-43 deposits are seen in 98% of cases of ALS and are also commonly found in frontotemporal dementia. The pathological TDP-43 deposits suggest a neurodegenerative cause of FOSMN with pathophysiology closely linked to that of ALS and frontotemporal dementia.[6]",
    "Diagnosis": "As with many neurological diseases, there is no test that is diagnostic of FOSMN. The diagnosis can be notoriously difficult, mainly on account of its rarity. Diagnosis is based on clinical signs and symptoms with exclusion of similar conditions. There are no validated diagnostic criteria.[6] The principal differential diagnosis to consider is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or a related motor neuron disorder: the chief distinction between the two is the presence of sensory abnormalities in FOSMN, and their absence in the motor neuron disorders. Diagnostic tests such as nerve conduction studies, electromyography, cerebrospinal fluid analyses, and blood tests can help narrow the diagnostic possibilities and support a clinical diagnosis.[6] Neurophysiology studies show a generalized sensory and motor neuronopathy which is most severe cranially.[3]",
    "Treatment": "There is currently no cure for FOSMN. Those with severe disease often require a feeding tube as swallowing is impaired.[6] Those with weakness affecting the muscles of respiration may require non-invasive ventilation. There have been case reports of symptom improvement after immunotherapy, suggesting a possible immune mediated etiology.[7]",
    "Prognosis": "The rate of disease progression is extremely variable with survival ranging from 14 months to 46 years. Of those who died from FOSMN, the mean duration of disease was 7.5 years.[6] Cranial nerve (bulbar) weakness is a common causes of death in those with FOSM, with aspiration pneumonia or respiratory failure commonly leading to death.[6]"

    "Disease": "Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Classically, weakness develops in the face, then the shoulder girdle, then the upper arm.[10] These muscles can be spared, and other muscles usually are affected. The order of muscle involvement can cause the appearance of weakness, \"descending\" from the face to the legs.[10] The distribution and degree of muscle weakness are extremely variable, even between identical twins.[20][21] Musculoskeletal pain is very common, most often described in the neck, shoulders, lower back, and the back of the knee.[22][4] Fatigue is also common.[4] Muscle weakness usually becomes noticeable on one side of the body before the other, a disease hallmark.[14] The right shoulder and arm muscles are more often affected than the left upper extremity muscles, independent of handedness.[23]: 139 [24][25][26] Otherwise, neither side of the body is at more risk. Classically, symptoms appear in those 15–30 years old, although adult onset can also occur.[4] Infantile-onset (also called early-onset), defined as onset before age 10, occurs in 10% of affected individuals.[10] FSHD1 with a substantial D4Z4 deletion (EcoRI 10-11 kb) is more strongly associated with infantile-onset and severe weakness.[27] Absence or near absence of symptoms is not uncommon, approaching up to 30% of mutation-carrying individuals in select FSHD1 families.[10] On average, FSHD2 presents 10 years later than FSHD1.[28] Otherwise, FSHD1 and FSHD2 are indistinguishable on the basis of weakness.[27] Disease progression is slow, and long static phases, in which no progression is apparent, are not uncommon.[29] Less commonly, individual muscles rapidly deteriorate over several months.[2] The symptom burden of FSHD is typically more severe than it is perceived to be by those without the disease.[30][31][32][33]\nWeakness of the muscles of the face is the most distinguishing sign of FSHD.[4] It is typically the earliest sign, although it is rarely the initial complaint.[4] At least mild facial weakness can be found in 90% or more with FSHD.[29][24] One of the most common deficits is inability to close the eyelids, which can result in sleeping with the eyelids open and dry eyes.[4] The implicated muscle is the orbicularis oculi muscle.[4] Another common deficit is an inability to purse the lips, causing an inability to pucker, whistle, or blow up a balloon.[4] The implicated muscle is the orbicularis oris muscle.[4] A third common deficit is the inability to raise the corners of the mouth, causing a \"horizontal smile,\" which looks more like a grin.[4] Responsible is the zygomaticus major muscle.[4]\nWeakness of facial muscles contributes to difficulty pronouncing words.[34] Facial expressions can appear diminished, arrogant, grumpy, or fatigued.[4] Muscles used for chewing and moving the eyes are not affected.[24][14] Difficulty swallowing is not typical, although can occur in advanced cases, which is at least in part due to facial muscle weakness.[35][34] FSHD is generally progressive, but it is not established whether facial weakness is progressive or stable throughout life.[36]\nAfter the facial weakness, weakness usually develops in the muscles of the chest and those that span from the scapula to the thorax. Symptoms involving the shoulder, such as difficulty working with the arms overhead, are the initial complaint in 80% of cases.[24][14] Predominantly, the serratus anterior and middle and lower trapezii muscles are affected;[4] the upper trapezius is often spared.[14] Trapezius weakness causes the scapulas to become downwardly rotated and protracted, resulting in winged scapulas, horizontal clavicles, and sloping shoulders; arm abduction is impaired. Serratus anterior weakness impairs arm flexion, and worsening of winging can be demonstrated when pushing against a wall. Muscles spanning from the scapula to the arm are generally spared, which include the deltoid and the rotator cuff muscles.[37][38] The deltoid can be affected later on, especially the upper portion.[4]\nSevere muscle wasting can make bones and spared shoulder muscles very visible, a characteristic example being the \"poly-hill\" sign elicited by arm elevation.[4] The first \"hill\" or bump is the upper corner of scapula appearing to \"herniate\" up and over the rib cage. The second hill is the AC joint, seen between a wasted upper trapezius and wasted upper deltoid. The third hill is the lower deltoid, distinguishable from the wasted upper deltoid and wasted humeral muscles.[4] Shoulder weakness and pain can, in turn, lead to shoulder instability, such as recurrent dislocation, subluxation, or downward translation of the humeral head.[39]\nAlso affected is the chest, particularly the parts of the pectoralis major muscle that connect to the sternum and ribs. The part that connects to the clavicle is less often affected. This muscle-wasting pattern can contribute to a prominent horizontal anterior axillary fold.[40][4] Beyond this point, the disease does not progress further in 30% of familial cases.[24][14] After upper torso weakness, weakness can \"descend\" to the upper arms (biceps muscle and, particularly, the triceps muscle).[24] The forearms are usually spared, resulting in an appearance some compare to the fictional character Popeye.[4] When the forearms are affected in advanced disease, the wrist extensors are more often affected.[24]\nAfter the upper body, weakness can next appear in either the pelvis or it \"skips\" the pelvis and involves the tibialis anterior (shin muscle), causing foot drop. One author considers the pelvic and thigh muscles the last group affected.[24] Pelvic weakness can manifest as a Trendelenburg's sign.[4] Weakness of the back of the thigh (hamstrings) is more common than weakness of the front of the thigh (quadriceps).[4] In more severe cases, especially infantile FSHD, there can be anterior pelvic tilt, with associated hyperextension of the knees.[41]\nWeakness can also occur in the abdominal muscles and paraspinal muscles, which can manifest as a protuberant abdomen and lumbar hyperlordosis.[2][4] Abdominal weakness can cause inability to do a sit-up or the inability to turn from one side to the other while lying on one's back.[4] Of the rectus abdominis muscle, the lower portion is preferentially affected, manifesting as a positive Beevor's sign.[4][2] In advanced cases, neck extensor weakness can cause the head to lean towards the chest, termed head drop.[24]\nThe most common non-musculoskeletal manifestation of FSHD is abnormalities in the small arteries (arterioles) in the retina. Tortuosity of the arterioles is seen in approximately 50% of those with FSHD. Less common arteriole abnormalities include telangiectasias and microaneurysms.[42][43] These abnormalities of arterioles usually do not affect vision or health, although a severe form of it mimics Coat's disease, a condition found in about 1% of FSHD cases and more frequently associated with large 4q35 deletions.[2][44] High-frequency sensorineural hearing loss can occur in those with large 4q35 deletions, but otherwise is no more common compared to the general population.[2] Large 4q35 deletion can lead to various other rare manifestations.[45]\nScoliosis can occur, thought to result from muscular weakness in the abdomen, hip extensors, and spine.[46][47] Conversely, scoliosis can be viewed as a compensatory mechanism to weakness.[46] Breathing can be affected, associated with kyphoscoliosis and wheelchair use; it is seen in one-third of wheelchair-using patients.[2] However, ventilator support (nocturnal or diurnal) is needed in only 1% of cases.[2][48] Although there are reports of increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias, the consensus is that the heart is unaffected.[14]",
    "Diagnosis": "FSHD can be presumptively diagnosed in many cases based on signs, symptoms, and/or non-genetic medical tests, especially if a first-degree relative has genetically confirmed FSHD.[10] Genetic testing can provide definitive diagnosis.[4] In the absence of an established family history of FSHD, diagnosis can be difficult due to the variability in how FSHD manifests.[86]\nGenetic testing is the gold standard for FSHD diagnosis, as it is the most sensitive and specific test available.[2] Commonly, FSHD1 is tested for first.[2] A shortened D4Z4 array length (EcoRI length of 10 kb to 38 kb) with an adjacent 4qA allele supports FSHD1.[2] If FSHD1 is not present, commonly FSHD2 is tested for next by assessing methylation at 4q35.[2] Low methylation (less than 20%) in the context of a 4qA allele is sufficient for diagnosis.[2] The specific mutation, usually one of the various SMCHD1 mutations, can be identified with next-generation sequencing (NGS).[87]\nMeasuring D4Z4 length is technically challenging due to the D4Z4 repeat array consisting of long, repetitive elements.[88] For example, NGS is not useful for assessing D4Z4 length, because it breaks DNA into fragments before reading them, and it is unclear from which D4Z4 repeat each sequenced fragment came.[4] In 2020, optical mapping became available for measuring D4Z4 array length, which is more precise and less labor-intensive than Southern blot.[89]\nMolecular combing is also available for assessing D4Z4 array length.[90] These methods, which physically measure the size of the D4Z4 repeat array, require specially prepared high-quality and high molecular weight genomic DNA (gDNA) from serum, increasing cost and reducing accessibility to testing.[91]\nRestriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis was the first genetic test developed and is still used as of 2020, although it is being phased out by newer methods. It involves dicing the DNA with restriction enzymes and sorting the resulting restriction fragments by size using southern blot. The restriction enzymes EcoRI and BlnI are commonly used. EcoRI isolates the 4q and 10q repeat arrays, and BlnI dices the 10q sequence into small pieces, allowing 4q to be distinguished.[4][51] The EcoRI restriction fragment is composed of three parts: 1) 5.7 kb proximal part, 2) the central, variable size D4Z4 repeat array, and 3) the distal part, usually 1.25 kb.[92] The proximal portion has a sequence of DNA stainable by the probe p13E-11, which is commonly used to visualize the EcoRI fragment during southern blot.[51] The name \"p13E-11\" reflects that it is a subclone of a DNA sequence designated as cosmid 13E during the human genome project.[93][94] Considering that each D4Z4 repeat is 3.3 kb, and the EcoRI fragment contains about 5 kb of DNA that is not part of the D4Z4 repeat array, the number of D4Z4 units can be calculated.[78]\nSometimes 4q or 10q will have a combination of D4Z4 and D4Z4-like repeats due to DNA exchange between 4q and 10q, which can yield erroneous results, requiring a more detailed workup.[51] Sometimes D4Z4 repeat array deletions can include the p13E-11 binding site, warranting use of alternate probes.[51][95]\nThe methylation status of 4q35 is traditionally assessed after FSHD1 testing is negative. Methylation sensitive restriction enzyme (MSRE) digestion showing hypomethylation has long been considered diagnostic of FSHD2.[91] Other methylation assays have been proposed or used in research settings, including methylated DNA immunoprecipitation and bisulfite sequencing, but are not routinely used in clinical practice.[96][91] Bisulfite sequencing, if validated, would be valuable due to it being able to use lower quality DNA sources, such as those found in saliva.[91]\nOther tests can support the diagnosis of FSHD, although they are all less sensitive and less specific than genetic testing.[97][4] Nonetheless, they can rule out similar-appearing conditions.[14]\nIncluded in the differential diagnosis of FSHD are limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (especially calpainopathy),[2] scapuloperoneal myopathy,[99] mitochondrial myopathy,[2] Pompe disease,[2] and polymyositis.[2] Calpainopathy and scapuloperoneal myopathy, like FSHD, present with scapular winging.[99] Features that suggest FSHD are facial weakness, asymmetric weakness, and lack of benefit from immunosuppression medications.[2] Features that suggest an alternative diagnosis are contractures, respiratory insufficiency, weakness of muscles controlling eye movement, and weakness of the tongue or throat.[14]",
    "Treatment": "No pharmacologic treatment has proven to slow the progression of weakness significantly or improve strength meaningfully.[100][2][10]\nThe American Academy of Neurology (AAN) recommends several medical tests to detect complications of FSHD.[100] A dilated eye exam to look for retinal abnormalities is recommended in those newly diagnosed with FSHD; for those with large D4Z4 deletions, an evaluation by a retinal specialist is recommended yearly.[101][2] A hearing test is recommended for individuals with early-onset FSHD before starting school, or for any other FSHD-affected individual with symptoms of hearing loss.[101][2] Pulmonary function testing (PFT) is recommended in those newly diagnosed to establish baseline pulmonary function,[2] and recurrently for those with pulmonary insufficiency symptoms or risks.[101][2] Routine screening for heart conditions, such as through an electrocardiogram (EKG) or echocardiogram (echo), is considered unnecessary in those without symptoms of heart disease.[100]\nAerobic exercise has been shown to reduce chronic fatigue and decelerate fatty infiltration of muscle in FSHD.[102][103] Physical activity in general might slow disease progression in the legs.[10] The AAN recommends that people with FSHD engage in low-intensity aerobic exercise to promote energy levels, muscle health, and bone health.[2] Moderate-intensity strength training appears to do no harm, although it has not been shown to be beneficial.[104] Physical therapy can address specific symptoms; there is no standardized protocol for FSHD. Anecdotal reports suggest that appropriately applied kinesiology tape can reduce pain.[105] Occupational therapy can be used for training in activities of daily living (ADLs) and to help adapt to new assistive devices. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to reduce chronic fatigue in FSHD, and it also decelerates fatty infiltration of muscle when directed towards increasing daily activity.[102][103]\nBraces are often used to address muscle weakness. Scapular bracing can improve scapular positioning, which improves shoulder function, although it is often deemed as ineffective or impractical.[106] Ankle-foot orthoses can improve walking, balance, and quality of life.[107]\nNo pharmaceuticals have definitively proven effective for altering the disease course.[100] Although a few pharmaceuticals have shown improved muscle mass in limited respects, they did not improve quality of life, and the AAN recommends against their use for FSHD.[100]\nScapular winging is amenable to surgical correction, namely operative scapular fixation. Scapular fixation is the restriction and stabilization of the position of the scapula, putting it in closer apposition to the rib cage and reducing winging. Absolute restriction of scapular motion by fixation of the scapula to the ribs is most commonly reported.[108] This procedure often involves inducing bony fusion, called arthrodesis, between the scapula and ribs. Names for this include scapulothoracic fusion, scapular fusion, and scapulodesis. This procedure increases arm active range of motion, improves arm function, decreases pain, and improves cosmetic appearance.[109][110] Active range of motion of the arm increases most in the setting of severe scapular winging with an unaffected deltoid muscle;[11] however, passive range of motion decreases. In other words, the patient gains the ability to slowly raise their arms to 90+ degrees, but they lose the ability to \"throw\" their arm up to a full 180 degrees.[2] The AAN states that scapular fixation can be offered cautiously to select patients after balancing these benefits against the adverse consequences of surgery and prolonged immobilization.[100][10]\nAnother form of operative scapular fixation is scapulopexy. \"Scapulo-\" refers to the scapula bone, and \"-pexy\" is derived from the Greek root \"to bind.\" Some versions of scapulopexy accomplish essentially the same result as scapulothoracic fusion, but instead of inducing bony fusion, the scapula is secured to the ribs with only wire, tendon grafts, or other material. Some versions of scapulopexy do not completely restrict scapular motion, examples including tethering the scapula to the ribs, vertebrae, or other scapula.[108][111] Scapulopexy is considered to be more conservative than scapulothoracic fusion, with reduced recovery time and less effect on breathing.[108] However, they also seem more susceptible to long-term failure.[108] Another form of scapular fixation, although not commonly done in FSHD, is tendon transfer, which involves surgically rearranging the attachments of muscles to bone.[108][112][113] Examples include pectoralis major transfer and the Eden–Lange procedure.\nVarious other surgical reconstructions have been described. Upper eyelid gold implants have been used for those unable to close their eyes.[114] Drooping lower lip has been addressed with plastic surgery.[115] Ability to smile can theoretically be restored with a tendon transfer, with donors such as a portion of the temporalis muscle, although evidence is lacking in FSHD.[116] Select cases of foot drop can be surgically corrected with tendon transfer, in which the tibialis posterior muscle is repurposed as a tibialis anterior muscle, a version of this being called the Bridle procedure.[117][118][105] Severe scoliosis caused by FSHD can be corrected with spinal fusion; however, since scoliosis might be a compensatory change in response to muscle weakness, correction of spinal alignment can result in further impaired muscle function.",
    "Prognosis": "Genetics partially predicts prognosis.[100] Those with large D4Z4 repeat deletions (with a remaining D4Z4 repeat array size of 10–20 kbp, or 1–4 repeats) are more likely to have severe and early disease, as well as non-muscular symptoms.[100] Those who have the genetic mutations of both FSHD1 and FSHD2 are more likely to have severe disease.[74] It has also been observed that D4Z4 shortening is less and disease manifestation is milder when a prominent family history is present, as opposed to a new mutation.[119] In some large families, 30% of those with the mutation had no noticeable symptoms, and 30% of those with symptoms did not progress beyond facial and shoulder weakness.[24] Women tend to develop symptoms later in life and have less severe disease courses.[113]\nThe remaining variations in the disease course are attributed to unknown environmental factors. A single study found that disease course is not worsened by tobacco smoking or alcohol consumption, common risk factors for other diseases.[120]\nPregnancy outcomes are overall good in mothers with FSHD; there is no difference in the rate of preterm labor, rate of miscarriage, and infant outcomes.[121] However, weakness can increase the need for assisted delivery.[121]\nA single review found that weakness worsens, without recovery, in 12% of mothers with FSHD during pregnancy, although this might be due to weight gain or deconditioning.[121]",
    "Epidemiology": "The prevalence of FSHD ranges from 1 in 8,333 to 1 in 15,000.[2] The Netherlands reports a prevalence of 1 in 8,333, after accounting for the undiagnosed.[122] The prevalence in the United States is commonly quoted as 1 in 15,000.[15]\nAfter genetic testing became possible in 1992, the average prevalence was found to be around 1 in 20,000, a large increase compared to before 1992.[123][24][122] However, 1 in 20,000 is likely an underestimation, since many with FSHD have mild symptoms and are never diagnosed, or they are siblings of affected individuals and never seek definitive diagnosis.[122]\nRace and ethnicity have not been shown to affect FSHD incidence or severity.[15]\nAlthough the inheritance of FSHD shows no predilection for biological sex, the disease manifests less often in women, and even when it manifests in women, they, on average, are less severely affected than affected males.[15] Estrogen has been suspected to be a protective factor that accounts for this discrepancy. One study found that estrogen reduced DUX4 activity.[124] However, another study found no association between disease severity and lifetime estrogen exposure in females. The same study found that disease progression was not different through periods of hormonal changes, such as menarche, pregnancy, and menopause.[125]"

    "Disease": "Familial Danish dementia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Vision problems are one of the earliest symptoms of FDD with cataracts usually appearing before age 30.[6] However, the development of cataracts can appear as early as age 20.[7] The median age for visual symptoms is 27.[6] Other ocular disorders including hemorrhages can also be present.[4]\nImpaired hearing manifests as severe or total perceptive loss of hearing and typically presents 10 to 20 years after the onset of ocular symptoms, whereas cerebellar ataxia appears soon after the age of 40.[4]\nIn most cases, paranoid psychosis occurs after the age of 50, followed by dementia. The majority of patients die in their fifties or sixties.[4]\nFDD patients also have extensive brain atrophy, particularly in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and white matter, as well as very thin and virtually demyelinated cranial nerves.\nCerebral amyloid angiopathy in this disorder is severe.[8] CAA is present in all regions of the central nervous system.[9]\nOther symptoms include intention tremor, neurofibrillary tangles, spasticity,[10] apathy, hyperorality, early dyscalculia, and stereotyped behavior.[11]",
    "Causes": "FDD is caused by a 10-nucleotide duplication prior to the stop codon of the BRI2/ITM2B gene. In healthy people, BRI2 is produced as an immature type-II membrane protein (imBRI2), which is cleaved at the C-terminus by a pro-protein convertase to create mature BRI2 (mBRI2) and a 23aa soluble C-terminal fragment (Bri23). However, in FDD patients, a longer C-terminal fragment, the ADan peptide, is formed from the Danish mutant protein (BRI2-ADan), which exhibits amyloidogenic features. ADan causes amyloid angiopathy in the cerebrum, choroid plexus, cerebellum, spinal cord, and retinas. [12]\nMutations in Cystatin C have also been suggested to be a cause of the disorder.[13]",
    "Diagnosis": "Due to the rarity of FDD, it is usually diagnosed based on family history and symptoms. Mutations in the BRI2 gene can be identified by genetic testing.[4]\nFDD shares similar neuropathological characteristics with Alzheimer disease, including extensive cerebrovascular amyloidosis, parenchymal amyloid and preamyloid lesions, and neurofibrillary degeneration. Surprisingly, a detailed anti-Aβ  immunohistochemical survey of various brain areas from all available FDD autopsy cases clearly identified a co-deposited with ADan primarily in vascular and perivascular amyloid lesions, although co-deposition was also found on a smaller scale in parenchymal preamyloid deposits.[14]\nDifferential diagnosis includes Begger syndrome and Refsum disease.[15]",
    "Prognosis": "Most people with this condition die when they reach their fifties or sixties,[2] with the median age of death being 58.[6] The most common cause of death in FDD is complications from pneumonia, diarrhea, and strokes.[15]",
    "Epidemiology": "Familial Danish Dementia has been reported in a single family spanning three generations,[16] with there being nine reported cases as of 2014.[7] Males and females are equally affected by the disorder.[6]"

    "Disease": "Familial dysautonomia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of familial dysautonomia usually commence during infancy and worsen with age, and may include gastrointestinal dysmotility (including erratic gastric emptying, gastroesophageal reflux, abnormal esophageal peristalsis, oropharyngeal incoordination),[3] dysphagia (as poor suckling in infancy) and frequent choking/gagging, recurrent vomiting, poor weight gain[6]/growth,[7] delayed development (especially walking) and puberty (especially in girls), recurrent aspiration pneumonia (due to inhalation of food or vomitus)[6] with possible secondary chronic lung disease,[3] absence of overflow tears during crying, corneal ulcers, red skin blotches and excessive sweating (often during eating or excitement), breath-holding spells, slurred speech/nasal voice, tongue ulcers (from accidental self-injuries), hyporeflexia (variable absence of deep tendon reflexes[8]), hypotonia, enuresis, arrhythmias, hypertension (including episodic hypertension in response to emotional stress or visceral pain[3]), hypotension (including orthostatic hypertension[7] with compensatory tachycardia (invariably present)[3]),[6] impaired (but not absent[3]) temperature and pain perception (leading to frequent accidental injury),[2][6] impaired proprioception, a smooth glossy tongue,[6] scoliosis (with possibly secondary restrictive lung disease[3]),[7] abnormal gait,[9] short stature, chronic renal failure (common), visual impairment, variable cognitive ability, characteristic facial features that develop with time, impaired vibration perception, lack of fungiform papilla of the tongue,[3] and impaired taste perception (especially for sweetness).[8]\nFamilial dysautonomia presents with progressive,[3] age-specific symptoms.\nThough usually not diagnosed until several years of age, generalised signs of FD are present during the newborn period in more than 80% of those affected.[8] Dysmorphic facial features are not directly inherent to the disorder, but facial asymmetry and a straightened mouth eventually develop due to abnormal tone and molding of facial bones.[8][3]\nA very high incidence of breech presentation has been noted among infants with FD.[8][10][11] A lower birth weight as compared to siblings,[10] premature birth, and intrauterine growth restriction[8] have also been noted.\nDuring the neonatal period, hypotonia, respiratory insufficiency, poor feeding with difficulty swallowing and aspiration, developmental delay, short stature, scoliosis, and corneal disease may occur.[8]\nIssues related to the disorder first appear during infancy. Early manifestations include hypotonia, feeding difficulty (impaired swallowing and suckling[2]), poor growth, absence of tears, frequent lung infections, and poor body-temperature control (infants may display cold hands and feet[2]). Developmental milestones (e.g. walking, speech) may or may not be delayed.[7]\nIn infants with FD, a lack of overflow tears during emotional crying may be noted after the age of 7 months (until this age, overflow emotional tearing may also not occur in unaffected infants;[12] overflow tearing is absent in neonates and begins to appear only after 2–3 months of age[8]).[12]\nAffected infants' hands may alternatively appear cool and mottled (from vasoconstriction), or red and swollen (from vasodilation).[8] Red skin blotching is often precipitated by emotional excitement.[8]\nIn older infants and young children, breath-holding spells may occur, possibly leading to cyanosis or fainting. Breath-holding behaviour usually ceases by age 6.[7]\nIn school-age children, bed wetting, vomiting episodes, impaired pain, and temperature perception, impaired blood pressure control (including orthostatic hypotension, hypertension during periods of psychological excitement or vomiting), learning disabilities (e.g. short attention span; learning disabilities are present in about a third of those with FD, and may require special education), scoliosis, poor bone quality and bone fractures, and kidney and heart issues may be seen.[7]\nIssues that tend to commence during adolescence or early adulthood include lung damage due to multiple respiratory infections, impaired kidney function, and impaired vision (due to atrophy of the optic nerve).[7] By adulthood, difficulties with balance and unaided walking often arise.[7]",
    "Causes": "Familial dysautonomia is the result of mutations in the IKBKAP gene on chromosome 9, which encodes for the IKAP protein (IkB kinase complex-associated protein). Three mutations in IKBKAP have been identified in individuals with FD. The most common FD-causing mutation occurs in intron 20 of the donor gene. Conversion of T→C in intron 20 of the donor gene resulted in shift splicing that generates an IKAP transcript lacking exon 20. Translation of this mRNA results in a truncated protein lacking all of the amino acids encoded by exons 20–37. Another less common mutation is a G→C conversion resulting in a one-amino-acid mutation in 696, where proline substitutes for normal arginine. The decreased amount of functional IKAP protein in cells causes familial dysautonomia.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "A clinical diagnosis of FD is supported by a constellation of criteria:[citation needed]\nGenetic testing is performed on a small sample of blood from the tested individual. The DNA is examined with a designed probe specific to the known mutations. The accuracy of the test is above 99%. Dr. Anat Blumenfeld of the Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem identified chromosome 9 as the responsible chromosome.[13]\nFamilial dysautonomia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. If both parents are shown to be carriers by genetic testing, a 25% chance exists that the child will have FD. For pregnancies at increased risk for FD, preimplantation genetic diagnosis or prenatal diagnosis by amniocentesis (at 15–17 weeks) or chorionic villus sampling (at 10–14 weeks) is possible.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "No cure for FD has been identified. The only two treatment centers are at New York University Hospital[14] and the Sheba Medical Center in Israel.[15] One is being planned for the San Francisco area.[16] Although the FD-causing gene has been identified and it seems to have tissue-specific expression, no definitive treatment exists at present.[citation needed]\nA major issue has been aspiration pneumonia. Fundoplications (by preventing regurgitation) and gastrostomy tubes (to preclude oral nutrition) have reduced the frequency of hospitalization.[citation needed] Other issues that can be treated include FD crises, scoliosis, and various eye conditions due to limited or no tears.[citation needed]\nTreatment of FD remains preventative, symptomatic, and supportive. FD does not express itself in a consistent manner. The types and severity of symptoms displayed vary among patients and even at different ages on the same patients, so patients should have specialized individual treatment plans. Medications are used to control vomiting, eye dryness, and abnormal blood pressure. Common management strategies include artificial tears, appropriate feeding strategy (maintenance of adequate nutrition, avoidance of aspiration (thickened formula and differently shaped nipples[further explanation needed] for infants)), daily chest physiotherapy (nebulization, bronchodilators, and postural drainage) for chronic pulmonary disease, pharmaceutical management of autonomic features (e.g. intravenous or rectal diazepam, or rectal chloral hydrate), preventing accidental injury, prevention of orthostatic hypotension (hydration, leg exercise, frequent small meals, a high-salt diet, and medication (e.g. with fludrocortisone)), treatment of orthopedic problems, compensating labile blood pressure.[citation needed]\nParents and patients should be informed regarding daily eye care and early signs of corneal problems, as well as punctal cautery. Informing patients and caretakers has resulted in decreased corneal scarring and the need for more aggressive surgical measures such as tarsorrhaphy, conjunctival flaps, and corneal transplants.[citation needed]",
    "Prognosis": "The average age of death is in the third decade of life, but affected persons may live into their 70s.[3] Death occurs in 50% of the affected individuals by age 30. The outlook for patients with FD depends on the particular diagnostic category. Patients with chronic, progressive, generalized dysautonomia in the setting of central nervous system degeneration have a generally poor long-term prognosis. Death can occur from pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, or sudden cardiopulmonary arrest in such patients.[citation needed]\nThe survival rate and quality of life have increased since the mid-1980s, mostly due to a greater understanding of the most dangerous symptoms. At present, FD patients can be expected to function independently if treatment is begun early and if major disabilities are avoided.[citation needed]",
    "Epidemiology": "Familial dysautonomia is seen almost exclusively in Ashkenazi Jews and is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Both parents must be carriers for a child to be affected. The carrier frequency in Jews of Eastern and Central European (Ashkenazi) ancestry is about one in 30, while the carrier frequency in non-Jews is unknown. If both parents are carriers, a one-in-four chance exists with each pregnancy for an affected child. Genetic counseling and genetic testing are recommended for families who may be carriers of familial dysautonomia.[13]\nWorldwide, about 600 diagnoses have been recorded since the discovery of the disease, with around 350 of them still living.[17]"

    "Disease": "Familial hemiplegic migraine",
    "Signs and symptoms": "FHM signs overlap significantly with those of migraine with aura. In short, FHM is typified by migraine with aura associated with hemiparesis, and in FHM1, cerebellar degeneration, which can result in episodic or progressive ataxia. FHM can also present with the same signs as benign familial infantile convulsions and alternating hemiplegia of childhood. Other symptoms are altered consciousness (in fact, some cases seem related to head trauma), gaze-evoked nystagmus, and coma. Aura symptoms, such as numbness and blurring of vision, typically persist for 30–60 minutes, but can last for weeks to months. An attack resembles a stroke, but unlike a stroke, it resolves in time. These signs typically first manifest themselves in the first or second decade of life.[citation needed]",
    "Causes": "See the equivalent section in the main migraine article.\nFHM mutations are believed to lead to migraine susceptibility by lowering the threshold for cortical-spreading-depression generation. The FHM1 and FHM3 mutations occur in ion channels expressed in neurons. These mutations may lead to both the hyper- and hypoexcitable neurons that might underlie cortical-spreading-depression. How the mutations seen in FHM2 patients might lead to FHM symptoms is even less clear, as the gene mutated in FHM2 is expressed primarily in astrocytes. One proposal states that the depolarization of astrocytes caused by haploinsufficiency of the ATP1A2 Na+/K+-ATPase causes increased release of compounds such as adenosine from astrocytes. These compounds then interact with neighboring neurons, altering their excitability and leading to cortical-spreading-depression and migraine.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis of FHM is made according to these criteria:[citation needed]\nSporadic forms follow the same diagnostic criteria, with the exception of family history.\nIn all cases, family and patient histories are used for diagnosis. Brain-imaging techniques, such as MRI, CAT scan, and SPECT,[46] are used to look for signs of other familial conditions such as CADASIL or mitochondrial disease, and for evidence of cerebellar degeneration. With the discovery of causative genes, genetic sequencing can also be used to verify diagnosis (though not all genetic loci are known).",
    "Treatment": "See the equivalent section in the main migraine article.\nPeople with FHM are encouraged to avoid activities that may trigger their attacks. Minor head trauma is a common attack precipitant, so FHM sufferers should avoid contact sports. Acetazolamide or standard drugs are often used to treat attacks, though those leading to vasoconstriction should be avoided due to the risk of stroke.[citation needed]",
    "Epidemiology": "Migraine itself is a very common disorder, occurring in 15–20% of the population. Hemiplegic migraine, be it familial or spontaneous, is less prevalent, at 0.01% prevalence according to one report.[47] Women are three times more likely to be affected than males.[citation needed]"

    "Diagnosis": "Disease onset is typically in early infancy but may occur later in life. Children who have the classic form of Farber disease develop symptoms within the first few weeks to months of life.[4] Individuals with moderate or attenuated forms may develop symptoms at any time in childhood. Sometimes it is difficult to diagnose Farber disease because the symptoms can be misdiagnosed as Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA).[10][11] Diagnosis is confirmed by molecular genetic testing of the ASAH1 gene or by measuring acid ceramidase enzyme activity.[4]",
    "Treatment": "There is no disease specific treatment for Farber disease. Anti-inflammatory medications, specifically tocilizumab (an interleukin-6 receptor inhibitor), has been shown to improve inflammation and pain in some patients.[12] Bone marrow transplant may improve granulomas (small masses of inflamed tissue) and inflammation in patients with little or no lung or nervous system complications.[13] Supportive therapies such as physical therapy, respiratory support, and mobility aids may be required.[citation needed]\nStudies in cells and mice have shown proof-of-concept for enzyme replacement therapy for Farber disease.[14] Aceragen, a biopharmaceutical company, is currently developing an investigational enzyme replacement therapy with a clinical study planned for late 2022.[citation needed]",
    "Prognosis": "Children with the most severe forms of Farber disease generally die by age 2–3 years.[4] The life expectancy of individuals with moderate or attenuated forms is unknown. The oldest reported individuals living with Farber disease were in their 50s and 60s.[15]",

    "Disease": "Fatal insomnia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The disease has four stages:[6]\nClinically, Fatal Insomnia manifests with a disordered sleep-wake cycle, dysautonomia, motor disturbances, and neuropsychiatric disorders.\nOther symptoms include profuse sweating, miosis (pinpoint pupils), sudden entrance into menopause or impotence, neck stiffness, and elevation of blood pressure and heart rate. The sporadic form of the disease often presents with double vision. Prolonged constipation is common as well. As the disease progresses, the person becomes stuck in a state of pre-sleep limbo, or hypnagogia, which is the state just before sleep in healthy individuals. During these stages, people commonly and repeatedly move their limbs as if they were  dreaming.[7]\nThe age of onset is variable, ranging from 13 to 60 years, with an average of 50.[8] The disease can be detected prior to onset by genetic testing.[9] Death usually occurs between 6–36 months from onset. The presentation of the disease varies considerably from person to person, even among people within the same family; in the sporadic form, for example, sleep problems are not commonly reported, and early symptoms are ataxia, cognitive impairment, and double vision.[10]",
    "Causes": "Fatal familial insomnia is a rare hereditary prion disease that is associated with a mutation in PRNP. The gene, which provides instructions for making the prion protein PrPC, is located on the short arm of chromosome 20 at position p13.[11] Individuals with FFI or familial Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (fCJD) both carry a mutation at codon 178 of the prion protein gene. FFI is also invariably linked to the presence of the methionine codon at position 129 of the mutant allele, whereas fCJD is linked to the presence of the valine codon at that position. The disease occurs when there is a change of amino acid at position 178 in which asparagine is found instead of the normal aspartic acid. This has to be accompanied with a methionine at position 129.[12]\nFFI is an autosomal dominant disease caused by a missense GAC-to-AAC mutation at codon 178 of the PRNP prion protein gene located on chromosome 20, along with the presence of the methionine polymorphism at position 129 of the mutant allele. Pathologically, FFI is characterized predominantly by thalamic degeneration—especially in the medio-dorsal and anteroventral nuclei.[13] Phenotypic variability is a perplexing feature of FFI.[14]\nPrion diseases are caused by the accumulation of misfolded prion proteins in the brain. Generally, prion disorders are characterized by long incubation periods and short clinical duration, which means the abnormal prions may accumulate for many years without causing symptoms (long incubation period), but once symptoms begin the disorder rapidly worsens.",
    "Treatment": "Treatment involves palliative care.[2] There is conflicting evidence over the use of sleeping pills, including barbiturates, as a treatment for the disease.[23][24] Symptoms of fatal familial insomnia may be treated with medications.[contradictory]\nClonazepam may be prescribed to treat muscle spasms, and eszopiclone or zolpidem may be prescribed to help treat insomnia. However, these drugs do not work in the long term.[25][better source needed]",
    "Prognosis": "Like all prion diseases, FFI is invariably fatal.[26][2] Life expectancy ranges from seven months to six years,[2] with an average of 18 months.[26]",
    "Epidemiology": "Fatal insomnia was first described by Elio Lugaresi et al. in 1986.\nIn 1998, 40 families were known to carry the gene for FFI globally: eight German, five Italian, four American, two French, two Australian, two British, one Japanese and one Austrian.[27] In the Basque Country of Spain, 16 family cases of the 178N mutation were seen between 1993 and 2005 related to two families with a common ancestor in the 18th century.[28] In 2011, another family was added to the list when researchers found the first man in the Netherlands to be diagnosed with FFI. Whilst he had lived in the Netherlands for 19 years, he was of Egyptian descent.[29] Other prion diseases are similar to FFI and may be related but are missing the D178N gene mutation.[7]\nAs of 20 September 2022[update], 37 cases of sporadic fatal insomnia have been diagnosed.[3] Unlike in FFI, those with sFI do not have the D178N mutation in the PRNP gene; they all have a different mutation in the same gene causing methionine homozygosity at codon 129.[30][31]\nNonetheless, the methionine presence in lieu of the valine (Val129) is what causes the sporadic form of disease. The targeting of this mutation has been suggested as a strategy for treatment, or possibly as a cure for the disease.[32]\nIn late 1983, Italian neurologist/sleep expert Dr. Ignazio Roiter received a patient at the University of Bologna hospital's sleep institute. The man, known only as Silvano, decided in a rare moment of consciousness to be recorded for future studies and to donate his brain for research in hopes of finding a cure for future victims.[33]\nIn 1986, Lugaresi and colleagues first named and described in detail the clinical and histopathological features of fatal familial insomnia.[34] This report was primarily based on the aforementioned Silvano. Dr. Roiter referred the case to Prof. Elio Lugaresi, a well-known sleep expert, who, along with his colleagues, carried out advanced sleep analyses. As Silvano's condition quickly deteriorated, Lugaresi arranged for a postmortem neuropathological examination of the brain to be carried out by Dr. Gambetti, Lugaresi's former trainee. The collaboration of these two groups led to the 1986 publication.[29] At the time, a prion disease was not suspected due to a lack of prion-related histopathology and frozen brain tissue for advanced analysis. However, due to the devotion of Dr. Roiter and Silvano's family, more cases were obtained, resulting in the classification of FFI as a familial prion disease tied to the 178Asn genetic mutation.[35]\nIn an article published in 2006, Schenkein and Montagna wrote of a 52-year-old American man who was able to exceed the average survival time by nearly one year with various strategies that included vitamin therapy and meditation, different stimulants and hypnotics and even complete sensory deprivation in an attempt to induce sleep at night and increase alertness during the day. He managed to write a book and drive hundreds of miles in this time, but nonetheless, over the course of his trials, the man succumbed to the classic four-stage progression of the illness.[33]\nIn 2011, the first reported case in the Netherlands was of a 57-year-old man of Egyptian descent. The man came in with symptoms of double vision and progressive memory loss, and his family also noted he had recently become disoriented, paranoid and confused. Whilst he tended to fall asleep at random during daily activities, he experienced vivid dreams and random muscular jerks during normal slow-wave sleep. After four months of these symptoms, he began to have convulsions in his hands, trunk and lower limbs while awake. The person died at age 58, seven months after the onset of symptoms. An autopsy revealed mild atrophy of the frontal cortex and moderate atrophy of the thalamus. The latter is one of the most common signs of FFI.[29]"

    "Disease": "Fazio%E2%80%93Londe disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "FLD produces rapidly progressive weakness of tongue, face and pharyngeal muscles in a clinical pattern similar to myasthenia. Neuromuscular transmission may be abnormal in these muscles because of rapid denervation and immature reinnervation. Paralysis occurs secondary to degeneration of the motor neurons of the brain stem. It causes progressive bulbar paralysis due to involvement of motor neurons of the cranial nerve nuclei. The most frequent symptoms at onset of progressive bulbar paralysis of childhood has been a unilateral facial paralysis. It is followed in frequency by dysarthria due to facial weakness or by dysphagia. Palatal weakness and palpebral ptosis also have been reported in few patients. Both sexes can be affected.[4][5][additional citation(s) needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "Symptoms of Fazio–Londe include bulbar palsy, hearing loss, facial weakness, and difficulty breathing. The disease is caused by mutations in the SLC52A2 gene and the SLC52A1 (GPR172B) genes which code for hRFT3 and hRFT1, human riboflavin transporters. Only muscle biopsy and examination of the transporter genes is considered to provide a definitive diagnosis. However, because the disease is so often fatal without treatment, and because the treatment is so inexpensive and with little risk, it is recommended that if the disease is suspected that riboflavin therapy be started immediately while testing is in progress.[8]",
    "Treatment": "The condition is treatable.[9] High doses of oral riboflavin 5 phosphate may work,[8] and sublingual flavin adenine dinucleotide may work.[10]",
    "Prognosis": "Onset of first symptom has been reported between 1–12 years, with a mean age of onset at 8 years. Clinical course can be divided into early (< 6 yrs age, predominance of respiratory symptoms) and late course (6–20 years of age, predominance of motor symptoms on superior limbs). Progression to involve other cranial nerve muscles occurs over a period of months or years. In the Gomez review, the facial nerve was affected in all cases while the hypoglossal nerve was involved in all cases except one. Other cranial nerves involved were vagus, trigeminal, spinal accessory nerve, abducens, oculomotor, and glossopharyngeal in this order. Corticospinal tract signs were found in 2 of the 14 patients.[citation needed]\nThe disease may progress to patient's death in a period as short as 9 months or may have a slow evolution or may show plateaus. Postmortem examination of cases have found depletion of nerve cells in the nuclei of cranial nerves. The histologic alterations found in patient with Fazio–Londe disease were identical to those seen in infantile-onset spinal muscular atrophy.[citation needed]\nStrength may improve with administration of cholinesterase inhibitors.[citation needed]"

    "Signs and symptoms": "Acute, tender, erythematous plaques, nodes, pseudovesicles and, occasionally, blisters with an annular or arciform pattern occur on the head, neck, legs, and arms, particularly the back of the hands and fingers.  The trunk is rarely involved. Fever (50%); arthralgia or arthritis (62%); eye involvement, most frequently conjunctivitis or iridocyclitis (38%); and oral aphthae (13%) are associated features.[citation needed]",
    "Causes": "SS can be classified based upon the clinical setting in which it occurs: classical or idiopathic SS, malignancy-associated SS, and drug-induced SS.[5]\nSS is a reactive phenomenon and should be considered a cutaneous marker of systemic disease.[5]  Careful systemic evaluation is indicated, especially when cutaneous lesions are severe or hematologic values are abnormal. Approximately 20% of cases are associated with malignancy, predominantly hematological, especially acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). An underlying condition (streptococcal infection, inflammatory bowel disease, nonlymphocytic leukemia and other hematologic malignancies, solid tumors, pregnancy) is found in up to 50% of cases. Attacks of SS may precede the hematologic diagnosis by 3 months to 6 years, so that close evaluation of patients in the “idiopathic” group is required.[citation needed]\nThere is now good evidence that treatment with hematopoietic growth factors—including granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), which is used to treat neutropenia, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor—can cause SS.[citation needed] Lesions typically occur when the patient has leukocytosis and neutrophilia but not when the patient is neutropenic. However, G-CSF may cause SS in neutropenic patients because of the induction of stem cell proliferation, the differentiation of neutrophils, and the prolongation of neutrophil survival.[citation needed]\nAlthough it may occur in the absence of other known disease, SS is often associated with hematologic disease (including leukemia, most commonly acute myelogenous leukemia), solid cancers (especially genitourinary, gastrointestinal and breast cancer) and immunologic diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease, Behçet's syndrome.[5]\nPregnancy associated Sweet syndrome typically presents in the first or second trimester. It may recur with subsequent pregnancies, but there seems to be no risk to the fetus.[citation needed]\nA genetic association has been suggested,[6] but no specific genetic link has been identified.\nIn Sweet syndrome, inflammatory lesions are known to occur not only on the skin, but also in various organs. When complications such as encephalitis or meningitis occur, it is referred to as neuro-Sweet disease.[7] It is known that treatment with corticosteroids often leads to favorable outcomes, and the frequencies of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types B54 and Cw1 are notably high, indicating their association with the condition. However, it is suggested that multiple risk factors, including these, are involved in the onset of the disease. While the more frequent HLA type associated with a related disorder, neuro-Behçet's disease, is different (B51), it is believed to form a spectrum of disorders with other shared predisposing factors.[8]",
    "Diagnosis": "The clinical differential diagnosis includes pyoderma gangrenosum, infection, erythema multiforme, adverse drug reactions, and urticaria.[citation needed] Recurrences are common and affect up to one third of patients.\nStudies show a moderate neutrophilia (less than 50%), elevated ESR (greater than 30 mm/h) (90%), and a slight increase in alkaline phosphatase (83%). Skin biopsy shows a papillary and mid-dermal mixed infiltrate of polymorphonuclear leukocytes with nuclear fragmentation and histiocytic cells. The infiltrate is predominantly perivascular with endothelial-cell swelling in some vessels, but vasculitic changes (blood clots; deposition of fibrin, complement, or immunoglobulins within the vessel walls; red blood cell extravasation;inflammatory infiltration of vascular walls) are absent in early lesions.Perivasculitis occurs secondarily, because of cytokines released by the lesional neutrophils. True transmural vasculitis is not an expected finding histopathologically in SS.[citation needed]\nSweet described a disease with four features: fever; leukocytosis; acute, tender, red plaques; and a papillary dermal infiltrate of neutrophils. This led to the name acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis. Larger series of patients showed that fever and neutrophilia are not consistently present.[citation needed] The diagnosis is based on the two constant features, a typical eruption and the characteristic histologic features;[citation needed] thus the eponym \"Sweet's syndrome\" is used.",
    "Treatment": "Systemic corticosteroids such as (prednisone) can produce rapid improvement and are the “gold standard” for treatment.[citation needed] The temperature, white blood cell count, and eruption improve within 72 hours. The skin lesions clear within 3 to 9 days. Abnormal laboratory values rapidly return to normal. There are, however, frequent recurrences. Corticosteroids are tapered within 2 to 6 weeks to zero.Resolution of the eruption is occasionally followed by milia and scarring. The disease clears spontaneously in some patients. Topical and/or intralesional corticosteroids may be effective as either monotherapy or adjuvant therapy.\nOral potassium iodide or colchicine may induce rapid resolution.Patients who have a potential systemic infection or in whom corticosteroids are contraindicated can use these agents as a first-line therapy.\nIn one study, indomethacin, 150 mg per day, was given for the first week, and 100 mg per day was given for 2 additional weeks. Seventeen of 18 patients had a good initial response; fever and arthralgias were markedly attenuated within 48 hours, and eruptions cleared between 7 and 14 days.\nPatients whose cutaneous lesions continued to develop were successfully treated with prednisone (1 mg/kg per day). No patient had a relapse after discontinuation of indomethacin.\nOther alternatives to corticosteroid treatment include dapsone, doxycycline, clofazimine, and cyclosporine. All of these drugs influence migration and other functions of neutrophils.[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva",
    "Signs and symptoms": "For unknown reasons, children born with FOP often have malformed big toes, sometimes missing a joint or, in other cases, simply presenting with a notable lump at the minor joint.[17] The first \"flare-up\" that leads to the formation of FOP bone usually occurs before the age of 10.[17] The bone growth generally progresses from the top of the body downward, just as bones grow in fetuses. A child with FOP will typically develop additional bones starting at the neck, then at the shoulders, arms, chest area, and finally at the feet.[22]\nSpecifically, ossification is typically first seen in the dorsal, axial, cranial, and proximal regions of the body. Later, the disease progresses in the ventral, appendicular, caudal, and distal regions.[17] However, it does not necessarily occur in this order due to injury-caused flare-ups. Often, the tumor-like lumps that characterize a flare-up of the disease appear suddenly.\nBone growth occurring during flare-ups may result in the loss of mobility to affected joints, including, if the jaw/mandible is involved, the inability to fully open the mouth, limiting speech and eating. Bone growth can also result in the immobilization of the hip or knee, affecting the individual's ability to walk. Extra bone formation around the rib cage restricts the expansion of lungs and diaphragm causing respiratory complications.[17]\nSince the disorder is incredibly rare, only occurring in 1 out of 2 million people, the condition may be misdiagnosed as cancer or fibrosis. Misdiagnoses can lead physicians to order biopsies, potentially exacerbating the growth of FOP bone.[23] The presence of malformed toes or thumbs in those born with FOP helps distinguish this disorder from other skeletal problems.[24]\nWith proper medical management the median age of survival is 40 years. However, delayed diagnosis, trauma, and infections can decrease life expectancy.[25]",
    "Causes": "FOP is caused by an autosomal dominant allele on chromosome 2q23-24.[10] The allele has variable expressivity, but complete penetrance. Most cases are caused by spontaneous mutation in the gametes; most people with FOP cannot or choose not to have children.  A similar but less catastrophic disease is fibrous dysplasia, which is caused by a post-zygotic mutation.\nA mutation in the gene ACVR1 (also known as activin-like kinase 2 (ALK2)) is responsible for the disease.[10] ACVR1 encodes activin receptor type-1, a BMP type-1 receptor. The mutation causes substitution of codon 206 from arginine to histidine in the ACVR1 protein.[11][12] This substitution causes abnormal activation of ACVR1, leading to the transformation of connective tissue and muscle tissue into a secondary skeleton. This causes endothelial cells to transform to mesenchymal stem cells and then to bone.[13] \nNormally, the ACVR1 gene encodes the activin receptor type-1 transmembrane kinase that bind BMP receptors (Type I BMPR and Type II BMPR) for chondrogenesis signaling. BMPs belong to a superfamily of proteins known as Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) proteins. The binding of ACVR1 protein to BMP receptors start a signaling cascade that is crucial for inducing endochondral bone formation during development, as well as, skeletal and tissue homeostasis.[14]\nFOP is an autosomal dominant disorder. Thus, a child of an affected heterozygous parent and an unaffected parent has a 50% probability of being affected. Two affected individuals can produce unaffected children. Two unaffected individuals can produce an affected offspring as a result of the mutation of the gene. The homozygous dominant form is more severe than the heterozygous form.[15]\nThe protein that causes ossification is normally deactivated by an inhibitory protein after a fetus's bones are formed in the womb, but in patients with FOP, the protein keeps working. Aberrant bone formation in patients with FOP occurs when injured connective tissue or muscle cells at the sites of injury or growth incorrectly express an enzyme for bone repair during apoptosis (self-regulated cell death), resulting in lymphocytes containing excess bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) provided during the immune system response. The bone that results occurs independently of the normal skeleton, forming its own discrete skeletal elements.  These elements, however, can fuse with normal skeletal bone.[16] The diaphragm, tongue, and extra-ocular muscles are spared in this process, as well as cardiac and smooth muscle.[17] Since the incorrect enzyme remains unresolved within the immune response, the body continues providing the incorrect BMP4-containing lymphocytes. BMP4 is a product that contributes to the development of the skeleton in the normal embryo.[18]\nThe ACVR1 gene encodes a bone morphogenic protein (BMP) receptor; this gene is mutated in FOP. It is responsible for growth and development of bone and muscles. The typical mutation, R202H, makes the inhibitor FKBP1A bind less tightly to the activation GS-loop.[19] The result is that ACVR1 is not effectively turned off, and an overgrowth of bone and cartilage and fusion of joints occurs.[20] Atypical mutations involving other residues work similarly. In some cases, the receptor can end up signalling that it's active without being bound to its activating ligand.[21]\nMost cases of FOP are the result of a new gene mutation: these people had no history of this particular disorder in their family. There are some cases where the individual has inherited the mutation from one affected parent.[20]",
    "Diagnosis": "FOP is diagnosed based on a combination of clinical features, imaging studies, and genetic testing. Hallmark clinical features of FOP include congenital malformations of the large toes (hallux valgus) and episodes of painful soft tissue swelling. The characteristic features of FOP on radiographs and CT scan include extraosseous bone formation in soft tissue, forming corticated bone in ribbons, sheets or bridges across joints. During flare-ups, MRI and ultrasound are sensitive for preosseous lessions, including soft tissue edema and enhancement  prior to ossification.[26] PET scans can identify early, metabolically active lesions, and can predict future sites of ossification.[27] Molecular genetic testing for FOP includes sequence analysis of the ACVR1 gene.[28]\nEarly diagnosis of this disorder through radiology is very important to avoid unnecessary invasive investigations like biopsies. The smallest or trivial trauma or intramuscular injections can amplify progression of the disease through inflammation hence the favorability of radiology. Clinicians should be aware of this rare entity, as it is frequently misdiagnosed as cancer or other benign entities such as infection, resulting in biopsies that can often hasten disease progression.[29]",
    "Treatment": "Notably, attempts to surgically remove bone in a FOP patient may result in explosive growth of new bone.[30] While undergoing anesthesia, people with FOP may encounter difficulties with intubation, restrictive pulmonary disease, and changes in the electrical conduction system of the heart.[31] Activities that increase the risk of falling or soft tissue injury should be avoided, as even minor trauma may provoke heterotopic ossification.[32] Intramuscular injections, including immunizations, should likewise be avoided in individuals with FOP, as these can also trigger ossification.[33]\nCurrently, surgery is not usually recommended for people with FOP as it can incite rapid bone formation at incision sites or where sutures have been applied to muscle or connective tissue. Life-saving surgery may be considered, however developing a surgical plan with input from a FOP specialist may be considered best practice. Surgical release of joint contractures is generally unsuccessful and risks new, trauma-induced heterotopic ossification.[34]\nFOP remains without a cure and there are currently no effective definitive treatments. There are though intermittent treatments such as anti-inflammatory drugs to suppress inflammation as a result of flare-ups or inflammation from muscle damage.\nA promising breakthrough lies in Sohonos (palovarotene), the first FDA-approved therapy for FOP.[35] Sohonos is a highly selective retinoic acid receptor gamma (RARγ) agonist that has been shown to reduce the volume of new heterotopic ossification in patients (males >10 years, females >8 years).[36] Long-term drug safety data has shown that retinoid-associated adverse effects are common with Sohonos therapy. These adverse efects include premature physeal closure in skeletally immature patients, decreased vertebral bone density and increased fracture risk.",
    "Epidemiology": "As of 2017[update], approximately 800 cases of FOP have been confirmed worldwide, making FOP one of the rarest diseases known.[5] The estimated incidence of FOP is 0.5 cases per million people, and it affects all ethnicities.[5]"

    "Disease": "Fibromuscular dysplasia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Symptoms expressed by FMD patients are largely dependent on the vascular bed(s) affected by the disease. Patients may also be entirely asymptomatic and have FMD discovered incidentally (e.g., when imaging studies are performed for other reasons). In a study from the United States Registry for Fibromuscular Dysplasia, the median age at first symptom was roughly 47 years.[2]\nThe main symptoms associated with renal FMD are secondary hypertension and bruits that can be heard with a stethoscope over the abdomen or flanks. Complications such as aneurysms, dissections, or occlusion of the renal artery have been associated with renal artery FMD.[4]\nThe carotid and vertebral arteries are most commonly affected. Middle and distal regions of the internal carotid arteries are frequently involved.[1] Patients with FMD in the carotid arteries typically present around 50 years of age.[3] Symptoms of craniocervical involvement include headaches (mostly migraine), pulsatile tinnitus, dizziness, and neck pain, although patients are often asymptomatic. On physical examination, one may detect neurological symptoms secondary to a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), a bruit over an affected artery, and diminished distal pulses. Complications of cerebrovascular FMD include TIA, ischemic stroke, Horner syndrome, or subarachnoid hemorrhage.[1][2][3]\nPatients with mesenteric, or intestinal, FMD may experience weight loss or abdominal pain after eating. FMD within the extremities may cause claudication or may be detectable by bruits.[1] If the lower limb arteries are affected, the patient may present with cold legs or evidence of distal embolic disease. FMD present in the subclavian artery may cause arm weakness, paresthesia, claudication, and subclavial steal syndrome.[6]\nChildren with FMD often report various non-specific symptoms or present with hypertension during routine physical examinations. Symptoms are commonly associated with the artery being affected. Symptoms may include headaches, insomnia, fatigue, and chest or abdominal pain. FMD affecting the arteries of the head and neck is commonly recognized as a cause of childhood strokes.[7] In children, renovascular disease accounts for approximately 10% of all causes of secondary hypertension.[8]\nDetection may stem from a bruit being present over the affected vascular bed during a physical assessment, though absence of a bruit does not preclude significant vascular disease.[8] Kidney failure is a common presentation in infants and children but is uncommon in adults, although it is occasionally the presenting problem in adults with focal disease.[3] For infants and children under four years, the presentation of FMD is \"especially likely to resemble vacuities\".[3]\nThe vascular subtype of Ehlers–Danlos Syndrome (type IV) has been associated with multi-focal FMD. This syndrome may be suspected in patients with multiple aneurysms and/or tears (dissections) in arteries, in addition to the typical angiographic findings of FMD. There have been isolated reports of FMD associated with other disorders, including Alport syndrome, pheochromocytoma, Marfan syndrome, Moyamoya disease, and Takayasu's arteritis.[9]",
    "Causes": "While the cause of FMD remains unclear, current theory suggests that there may be a genetic predisposition as case reports have identified clusters of the disease and prevalence among twins.[7] According to Cleveland Clinic, approximately 10% of cases appear to be inherited and FMD often coexists with other genetic abnormalities that affect the blood vessels.[citation needed] Approximately 10% of patients with FMD have an affected family member.[1] A study conducted from the patient registry at Michigan Cardiovascular Outcomes Research and Reporting Program (MCORRP) at the University of Michigan Health System reported a high prevalence of a family history of stroke (53.5%), aneurysm (23.5%), and sudden death (19.8%).[2] Though FMD is a non-atherosclerotic disease, family histories of hypertension and hyperlipidemia were also common among those diagnosed with FMD. It is believed that there is not a single cause of FMD, but that there are multiple underlying factors. There are theories of effects of hormonal influence, mechanical stress from trauma and stress to the artery walls, and loss of oxygen supply to the blood vessel wall caused by fibrous lesions.[7] It has been suggested that environmental factors, such as smoking and estrogen, may play a role in addition to genetic factors, however concerns for safety associated with exogenous female hormones in FMD remain theoretical. [10]",
    "Diagnosis": "It is the lack of specific symptoms and their potential to appear anywhere that makes FMD a challenge to detect early on. The most accurate diagnosis comes from combining clinical presentation and angiographic imaging. According to the Michigan Cardiovascular Outcomes Research and Reporting Program (MCORRP, 2013) the length of time from a patient's first signs or symptoms to diagnosis is commonly 5 years.[citation needed]\nFMD is currently diagnosed through the use of both invasive and non-invasive tests.[10] Non-invasive testing includes duplex ultrasonography, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and computed tomography angiography (CTA).[4] Invasive testing through angiography is considered the best way to detect FMD, though it is typically not done early in the diagnosis process due to the higher risk of complications. Occasionally, FMD is diagnosed asymptomatically after an unrelated x-ray presents the classic \"string of beads\" appearance of the arteries, or when a practitioner investigates an unexpected bruit found during an exam. As part of the diagnosis process, a practitioner may review medical and family history and perform vascular examination.[citation needed]\nA definitive diagnosis of FMD can only be made with imaging studies. Catheter-based angiography (with contrast) is the most accurate imaging technique; this test involves a catheter inserted into a large artery and advanced until it reaches the examined vessel.[1] The catheter allows practitioners to view and measure the pressure of the artery aiding in the categorization and severity of the FMD diseased artery. According to a study published in the Journal of Vascular Surgery, \"catheter-based angiography is the only imaging modality that can accurately identify the changes of FMD, aneurysm formation, and dissection in the branch vessels.\"[4] Practitioners believe it is important to utilize intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging because stenosis can sometimes only be detected through the methods of pressure gradient or IVUS imaging.[4] In addition, computed tomography angiography and magnetic resonance angiography are commonly used to evaluate arteries in the brain. Doppler ultrasound may be used in both the diagnosis and follow-up of FMD.[1]\nIn the visceral distribution, segmental arterial mediolysis may mimic FMD. In the visceral and cerebrovascular distribution, atherosclerosis must be considered.[citation needed]\nThe differentiating presentations are suggestive of FMD being a unique syndrome in respect to the pediatric population. Experienced FMD clinicians warn against relying on the \"string of beads\" angiography for a diagnosis.It is suggested that FMD may be both under and over-diagnosed in children with stroke.[7]",
    "Treatment": "There is no known cure for FMD. However, treatment focuses on relieving associated symptoms. Medical management is the most common form of treatment. The best approach to medically managing these patients is constantly being re-evaluated as more information is learned about the disease.[1]\nBlood pressure control is the primary concern when treating patients with renal FMD, as the ideal blood pressure target in patients with FMD is unknown.[10] In cases of renal artery stenosis and indications for intervention, percutaneous balloon angioplasty may be recommended. Many studies have assessed the success rate of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in these cases, and have found relief of hypertensive symptoms.[3][12] Duplex ultrasonography should be performed soon after this procedure to ensure adequate renal velocities.[3]\nStents have a restenosis rate of 10–20%, and may make surgical revascularization more difficult. Surgical revascularization may be necessary if aneurysms develop within the affected artery or if PTA does not resolve the issue.[citation needed]\nEx vivo renal artery reconstruction is sometimes used for complex diseases where branches of the renal artery are affected.[13]\nPatients with carotid or vertebral FMD are medically managed to reduce the risk of a stroke. Aspirin 81 mg is typically prescribed for patients with carotid FMD. Antiplatelets and anticoagulants may be used to reduce the risk of blood clot formation. If a TIA or stroke occur, percutaneous angioplasty and antiplatelet therapy may be necessary.[3] Pulsatile tinnitus is manifests in 32% of US cerebrovascular FMD patients, and sound or cognitive behavioral therapy may be helpful for some patients with more severe symptoms.[10]\nThere is little information regarding the best treatment for FMD outside of the renal and extracranial regions. If claudication or limb ischemia is consequent to FMD in the extremities, angioplasty may be implemented.[citation needed]\nIn pediatric cases, treatment is determined by factors such as age and disease location but it routinely involves controlling hypertension, re-establishing vascular flow, preventing clots, and improving lifestyle through diet, exercise, and smoking cessation. Medical therapy for pediatric population may involve the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitors) and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers, multiple anti-hypertensive medications, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and beta-blockers. Prevention of thrombosis of affected arteries may be taken through administration of an antiplatelet medication such as aspirin.[1]\nPercutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) is considered the best treatment for renal-artery FMD. It is useful when hypertension is difficult to control, such as when the patient is intolerant to the anti-hypertensive medications, non-compliant to medication regime, or experiencing loss of renal volume due to ischemia. PTRA can also aid in preventing a lifelong dependency on medication. According to an article published in Cath Lab Digest, \"effective PTRAs result in cured or controlled blood pressure, which is often signified by reductions in plasma renin activity and angiotensin II levels, and when compared with surgery, percutaneous balloon angioplasty is less costly, able to be performed on an outpatient basis, results in lower morbidity, and the use of stenting is not primarily necessary.\"[8] However, there is a subset of the pediatric population that is resistant to PTRA. Adverse events may include, \"recurrent stenosis, arterial occlusion with renal loss, and arterial rupture with extravasations and pseudo aneurysm formation and may require surgical intervention.\"[This quote needs a citation]",
    "Prognosis": "Research on FMD prognoses and outcomes is scant. In some cases, if not managed properly, FMD-related aneurysms can occur and cause bleeding into the brain, resulting in a stroke, permanent nerve damage, or death. Patients with multi-focal fibroplasia generally have a favorable prognosis. Those who present with FMD in multiple vascular beds, or focal disease involving multiple branches of the renal arteries, may develop renal artery dissection [14] or progressive renal impairment, therefore having a more difficult and complex prognostic course.[3] There are no specific studies or reports on the long-term prognosis and outcome of FMD in children.[1]"

    "Disease": "Filippi syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The symptoms of Filippi Syndrome can be congenital (apparent as an infant).[1] The occurrence and severity of such symptoms are variable across affected individuals.[1][2] The progression of symptoms over one's lifetime has not been thoroughly studied due to the small number of people with Filippi Syndrome globally.[2]\nMalformations of digits are expressed among people with Filippi Syndrome.[1] One of the most common malformations is the webbing or fusion of digits, which is termed syndactyly.[1][2][5] In particular, syndactyly of the third and fourth fingers or the second, third and fourth toes is termed \"syndactyly type 1\".[1] The degree of syndactyly may differ across affected individuals, with some exhibiting syndactyly of soft tissues and skin only, and more severe cases exhibiting syndactyly of digital bones.[1]\nOther malformations of digits include clinodactyly (curving) of the fifth fingers and brachydactyly (abnormal shortening) of digits.[1][2] Brachydactyly is believed to be largely due to abnormalities arising from the bones inside the hands and feet, specifically the metacarpals and metatarsals.[1]\nFurthermore, most people with Filippi Syndrome exhibit craniofacial abnormalities.[1] Craniofacial abnormalities are birth defects observed at the head or face region of affected individuals.[6] Some of the craniofacial abnormalities present in people with Filippi Syndrome include microcephaly (having a skull that is smaller than normal), prominent/ elevated nasal bridge, hypertelorism (having one's pair of eyes further apart from each other than normal), and underdeveloped nasal alae (underdeveloped tissues surrounding the nostril).[1][2][7] Less common craniofacial abnormalities include having a broad forehead, thin vermilion border (having a thin upper lip), and frontal hirsutism (having a hairy forehead).[2]\nPeople with Filippi Syndrome may also demonstrate varying degrees of intellectual disability.[1][2] Affected individuals may experience defective speech development, aphasia (experiencing difficulty in finding the appropriate words to use), vision impairment, and an inability to speak.[1][2]\nAnother characteristic symptom of people with Filippi Syndrome is the occurrence of growth retardation, which is also referred to as growth delay.[1][2][5] Such growth delays may be either prenatal or postnatal, meaning that they can occur both before and after birth.[1][2] In particular, delayed bone maturation can be observed in patients with Filippi Syndrome.[2]\nPeople with Filippi Syndrome may exhibit some other physical abnormalities. Examples of such abnormalities include dwarfism (having a severely short stature), dislocated elbows, decreased joint mobility, muscular hypotonia (having weak muscle tone), and involuntary muscle stiffness.[1][2]\nThey may also exhibit abnormal conditions at their skin and teeth.[1] Moreover, a portion of affected males may demonstrate cryptorchidism (a condition in which the testes fail to descend into the scrotum).[1]",
    "Causes": "Filippi syndrome is a genetic disease with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern at the Cytoskeleton Associated Protein 2 Like (CKAP2L) gene.[1][2][7][8]\nAn autosomal recessive inheritance pattern means that the disease trait is exhibited on an individual only when both copies of the disease gene in the individual demonstrate a specific pathogenic mutation.[2] This happens when the individual inherits one copy of the mutated gene from each of their parents.[2] In the case of Filippi Syndrome, both copies of the CKAP2L gene of an individual have to be mutated in order for them to demonstrate symptoms of the disorder.[1][2]\nThe CKAP2L gene is the human ortholog of the mouse CKAP2I (Radmis) gene.[9] It contains 10 exons and is located on chromosome 2q14.1.[9] It is a protein-coding gene that is associated with microtubules and some cellular structures involved in mitosis.[9][10] The CKAP2L gene is essential for the proper formation of mitotic spindles during mitosis and the progression of the cell cycle of human cells.[10] The expression pattern of the CKAP2L gene can explain the occurrence of syndactyly in Filippi Syndrome.[10]\nMultiple mutations at the CKAP2L gene can cause Filippi Syndrome. Some of these mutations include a 1-base pair duplication in exon 4, a 2-base pair insertion in exon 2, a 1-base pair deletion in exon 4, and a 329-base pair deletion in exon 4 of the gene.[10] The above mutations cause a frameshift in the gene.[10] A frameshift mutation refers to a condition in which the reading frame of the gene is disrupted by the insertion or deletion of base pairs from the gene (if the number of inserted or deleted base pairs is not divisible by three).[11] This frameshift mutation ultimately results in a premature termination codon (the formation of a termination codon at a position more \"forward\" than normal).[10] Other mutations include a base pair transition in the start codon, which is the starting site of translation of the gene.[10] A transition mutation occurring at this codon disrupts the codon sequence and abolishes the site.[10] This prevents the cell from carrying out translation of the gene.",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of Filippi Syndrome is mostly done postnatally.[7] Initial diagnosis of the disease relies on clinical observation of symptoms, including different degrees of syndactyly and craniofacial abnormalities, exhibited by affected individuals.[2][3] Diagnosis can also be done through radiography, which checks for malformation of digits.[3]\nConfirmation of diagnosis requires the use of genetic testing.[8] Specifically, it can be done through detecting mutations in the CKAP2L gene, of which a total of eight causative variants having been identified.[8][12]\nGenetic testing of Filippi Syndrome makes use of three major techniques:",
    "Treatment": "Currently, Filippi Syndrome has no direct cure. It is treated according to observed symptoms on affected individuals.[2]\nSyndactyly exhibit varying degrees of severity in individuals.[1] Hence not all affected individuals with this condition must undergo surgical intervention.[16] For example, syndactyly that occurs at the proximal end of the digits may have limited effect on the normal functioning of the hand and foot, and correction through surgery is optional.[16]\nSimple syndactyly is the condition of cutaneous fusion between two digits, and can be treated by surgically rebuilding the hourglass shape web space between digits.[17] During surgery, incision is first carried out to separate the fused fingers.[16][17] It is followed by reconstruction of the web space's side walls using dorsal advancement flaps or skin grafts obtained from the affected individual's groin.[16][17] After reconstruction, additional fingerpulp flaps are required for rebuilding of the nailfold between the nail bed and the surrounding skin if there is the occurrence of syndactyly at the tip of the fingers.[16][17]\nTreatment for complex syndactyly, which refers to the bony fusion between two digits, has a higher degree of complexity. It involves the reconstruction of web space as well as highly specific surgical procedures with accordance to different types of bony fusion.[17] It may also require separation and relocation of the flexor digitorum profundus or tendon-diverted transplantation if the structure of the tendons in the fused digits are also affected by syndactyly.[17]\nProfessionals usually advice that affected individuals receive surgical treatment during the first two years of life to avoid hindrance to motor ability development.[16]\nCraniofacial abnormalities can be corrected through surgical methods.\nAffected individuals with severe hypertelorism may undergo orbital osteotomy.[18] The two major osteotomy methods are box osteotomy and facial bipartition, which operate from different osteotomy sites but follow the same general procedures.[19][20] During surgery, part of the bone, and sometimes excessive skin, are selectively removed from the central area of the nasofrontal region, such that this part of the skull can close in and correct hypertelorism.[19] In addition, bone grafts are placed to provide support to the eyeballs and protect them from displacement.[19]\nUnderdeveloped nasal alae can be corrected by orofacial reconstruction. This procedure recreates the nasal alae with the use of cartilage grafts, which are cartilage taken from the patient's ear, septum or rib.[21] Afterwards, nasolabial flaps are placed to sustain the shape of the nose, specifically the alar groove.[21]\nPatients who are affected by speech impairments can be treated by speech therapy.[1]\nSpeech disability can be a manifestation of various physical or psychological causes. Symptomatic treatment of it is carried out after diagnostic tests such as video fluoroscopic barium study (\"cookie swallow\" test) or fiber-optic endoscopic evaluation.[22] Despite the diversity in speech therapy techniques, most treatment plans follow the same progression:[23]\nFor post-treatment monitoring, computer-based speech therapy that makes use of instructional software can provide computer-led practices as aftercare and quantify performances outside of conventional treatments.[24]",
    "Epidemiology": "Filippi syndrome is rare, with an estimated prevalence of less than one in a million.[7] It has around thirty cases recorded in medical literature.[2]\nThe number of affected males recorded is more than twice the number of affected females.[12] However, this is insufficient to conclude that male are at a higher risk due to the small number of reported cases.[12] However, the CDC says less than 25 cases have been reported,[25] the National Organization for Rare Disorders says about 18 cases have been reported,[4] while the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences says 30 cases have been reported in literature.[26]"

    "Disease": "Florid cutaneous papillomatosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The characteristic eruption is of multiple warty papules and nodules beginning on acral skin, especially the hands and wrists, and disseminating onto the skin of the entire body. These skin lesions develop on the trunk, extremities, and face.[1]: 63  Pruritus is also associated.",
    "Causes": "The etiology of florid cutaneous papillomatosis is unknown. It is likely directly induced by an underlying neoplasm secreting a growth factor. One candidate may be alpha-transforming growth factor, structurally related to epidermal growth factor, but antigenically distinct from it. The underlying cancer is most often gastric adenocarcinoma[1]: 63 [2][3] but also with breast cancer, bladder cancer, hepatobiliary cancer, ovarian cancer, uterine cancer,[4] prostate cancer[citation needed], lung cancer[5] and cervical cancer.[6] Other associated underlying malignancies include squamous cell carcinomas and lymphomas.[7]",
    "Diagnosis": "The sudden eruption of papulonodules usually indistinguishable from common viral warts should suggest this diagnosis. These papulonodules begin on the extremities, especially on the dorsa of the hands and the wrists and may disseminate to involve the entire body, including the face.[8] The papulonodules may vary in size from 2–3 mm to 10 mm in diameter. Pruritus is often associated.\nFlorid cutaneous papillomatosis is linked with an underlying cancer. Malignant acanthosis nigricans may also become evident, many times with the sudden eruption of multiple seborrheic keratoses, known as the sign of Leser-Trélat.[9][10][11] Florid cutaneous papillomatosis mandates a search for an underlying malignancy, recognizing that it may be seen in patients with multiple visceral carcinomas. Histologic examination shows uniform and pronounced hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and papillomatosis without epidermal vacuolization, parakeratosis, or eosinophilic inclusions suggestive of viral warts.[12]\nThe sudden quality of the eruption of florid cutaneous papillomatosis and its anatomic distribution should facilitate distinction from widespread common warts and from epidermodysplasia verruciformis.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Identifying and treatment the underlying malignancy constitutes an uptime approach. Topical 5-fluorouracil may occasionally be help, as may oral retinoids, topical steroids, vitamin A acid, urea, salicylic acid, podophyllotoxin, and cryodestruction employing liquid.[citation needed]",

They also frequently exhibit absence of speech, autistic behavior, teeth grinding or clenching, delayed myelination, bilateral tonic-clonic seizures, choreoathetosis, intellectual disability, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), weight loss, constipation, sialorrhea (drooling), frequent crying without apparent cause, frequent laughing, muscle spasticity, vision problems, tardive dyskinesias, poor eye contact, myoclonic jerks, postnatal growth failure, and short stature. Occasionally, patients may also experience abnormal breathing, scoliosis with or without kyphosis, hypoplasia of the optic disk, poor speech, inability to ambulate, developmental regression, and pachygyria. In very rare cases, they might have repeated seizures without recovery.[8][9][10]",
    "Causes": "FOXG1 syndrome is caused by heterozygous mutations in the gene FOXG1. This gene provides instructions for making the protein Forkhead box protein G1 (FOXG1).[6][9] Most people with FOXG1 syndrome have a new mutation (which means that mutation is new and none of the parents have it), although there have been cases of person inheriting the pathogenic variant of FOXG1 from a healthy parent due to somatic mosaicism.[13][14][15][16]",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnostic criteria for FOXG1 syndrome have been established. Major diagnostic criteria include a de novo mutation in the FOXG1 gene, intellectual disability, an uneventful prenatal period, onset of symptoms within the first months of life, secondary microcephaly, poor muscle tone, severely delayed development with absent speech, and EEG abnormalities. Minor criteria include an irritable mood, facial dysmorphism (such as widely spaced eyes, anteverted ears, and a bulging forehead), strabismus (squint), teeth grinding, GERD, constipation, seizures, sleep pattern anomalies, dystonia, stereotypies, and autistic behaviors.[11][12]",
    "Treatment": "This disease doesn't have a cure,[42] but some of the symptoms can be managed.[42] A multidisciplinary team is generally employed to treat the person's symptoms during their lifetime. The team might include specialist in: neurogenetics, genetic counseling, rehabilitation medicine, orthopedics, gastroenterology, physical therapy and ophthalmology.[43]\nSeizures can be managed or mitigated by antiseizure medication (ASMs), common ASMs include clobazam, valproic acid, vigabatrin, felbamate, lamotrigine and steroids.[44] Although, there isn't universal treatment of the seizures in FOXG1 syndrome.[10]\nDyskinetic movement disorder can be managed through anti-dyskinetic medications (for example: pimozide, tetrabenazine, clonidine, etc), Although no single drug has been found to be effective for this disorder.[45]\nPhysical therapy is useful to make muscle tone better, it is also useful for strength improvement.[43][46]",

    "Disease": "Friedreich%27s ataxia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Symptoms typically start between the ages of 5 and 15, but in late-onset FRDA, they may occur after the age of 25 years.[1]  The symptoms are broad, but consistently involve gait and limb ataxia, dysarthria and loss of lower limb reflexes.[1]\nThere is some variability in symptom frequency, onset and progression. All individuals with FRDA develop neurological symptoms, including dysarthria and loss of lower limb reflexes, and more than 90% present with ataxia.[1] Cardiac issues are very common with early onset FRDA .[1] Most individuals develop heart problems such as enlargement of the heart, symmetrical hypertrophy, heart murmurs, atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and conduction defects. Scoliosis is present in about 60%. 7% of people with FRDA also have diabetes, and having diabetes hurts people with FA, especially those who show symptoms when young.[2][3]\nPeople who have been living with FRDA for a long time may develop other complications. 36.8% experience decreased visual acuity, which may be progressive and could lead to functional blindness.[3]  Hearing loss is present in about 10.9% of cases.[3]  Some patients report bladder and bowel symptoms.[4] Advanced stages of disease are associated with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, most commonly atrial fibrillation.[1]\nOther later stage symptoms can include, cerebellar effects such as nystagmus, fast saccadic eye movements, dysmetria and loss of coordination (truncal ataxia, and stomping gait).[1] Symptoms can involve the dorsal column, such as the loss of vibratory sensation and proprioceptive sensation.[1]\nThe progressive loss of coordination and muscle strength leads to the full-time use of a wheelchair.  Most young people diagnosed with FRDA require mobility aids such as a cane, walker, or wheelchair by the early 20s.[5]\nThe disease is progressive, with increasing staggering or stumbling gait and frequent falling.  By the third decade, affected people lose the ability to stand or walk without assistance and require a wheelchair for mobility.[6]\nNon-neurological symptoms such as scoliosis, pes cavus, cardiomyopathy and diabetes are more frequent among the early-onset cases.[1]",
    "Diagnosis": "Balance difficulty, loss of proprioception, an absence of reflexes, and signs of other neurological problems are common signs from a physical examination.[6][20] Diagnostic tests are made to confirm a physical examination such as electromyogram, nerve conduction studies, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, blood tests for elevated glucose levels and vitamin E levels, and scans such as X-ray radiograph for scoliosis.[21] MRI and CT scans of brain and spinal cord are done to rule out other neurological conditions.[22] Finally, a genetic test is conducted to confirm.[22]\nOther diagnoses might include Charcot-Marie-Tooth types 1 and 2, ataxia with vitamin E deficiency, ataxia-oculomotor apraxia types 1 and 2,  and other early-onset ataxias.[23]",
    "Treatment": "Physicians and patients can reference the clinical management guidelines for Friedreich ataxia.[24] These guidelines are intended to assist qualified healthcare professionals in making informed treatment decisions about the care of individuals with Friedreich ataxia.[25]\nPhysical therapists play a critical role in educating on correct posture, muscle use, and the identification and avoidance of features that aggravate spasticities such as tight clothing, poorly adjusted wheelchairs, pain, and infection.[33]\nPhysical therapy typically includes intensive motor coordination, balance, and stabilization training to preserve gains.[34]  Low-intensity strengthening exercises are incorporated to maintain functional use of the upper and lower extremities.[34]  Stretching and muscle relaxation exercises can be prescribed to help manage spasticity and prevent deformities.[34] Other physical therapy goals include increased transfer and locomotion independence, muscle strengthening, increased physical resilience, \"safe fall\" strategy, learning to use mobility aids, learning how to reduce the body's energy expenditure, and developing specific breathing patterns.[34]  Speech therapy can improve voice quality.[35]\nWell-fitted orthoses can promote correct posture, support normal joint alignment, stabilize joints during walking, improve range of motion and gait, reduce spasticity, and prevent foot deformities and scoliosis.[5]\nFunctional electrical stimulation or transcutaneous nerve stimulation devices may alleviate symptoms.[5]\nAs progression of ataxia continues, assistive devices such as a cane, walker, or wheelchair may be required for mobility and independence. A standing frame can help reduce the secondary complications of prolonged use of a wheelchair.[36][37]\nCardiac abnormalities can be controlled with ACE inhibitors such as enalapril, ramipril, lisinopril, or trandolapril, sometimes used in conjunction with beta blockers. Affected people who also have symptomatic congestive heart failure may be prescribed eplerenone or digoxin to keep cardiac abnormalities under control.[5]\nSurgery may correct deformities caused by abnormal muscle tone. Titanium screws and rods inserted in the spine help prevent or slow the progression of scoliosis. Surgery to lengthen the Achilles tendon can improve independence and mobility to alleviate equinus deformity.[5] An automated implantable cardioverter-defibrillator can be implanted after a severe heart failure.[5]",
    "Prognosis": "The disease evolves differently in different people.[36] In general, those diagnosed at a younger age or with longer GAA triplet expansions tend to have more severe symptoms.[5]\nCongestive heart failure and abnormal heart rhythms are the leading causes of death,[38] but people with fewer symptoms can live into their 60s or older.[22]",
    "Epidemiology": "FRDA affects Indo-European populations. It is rare in East Asians, sub-Saharan Africans, and Native Americans.[39] FRDA is the most prevalent inherited ataxia, affecting approximately 1 in 40,000 with European descent.[15] Males and females are affected equally. The estimated carrier prevalence is 1:100.[5] A 1990–1996 study of Europeans calculated the incidence rate was 2.8:100,000.[40] The prevalence rate of FRDA in Japan is 1:1,000,000.[41]\nFRDA follows the same pattern as haplogroup R1b. Haplogroup R1b is the most frequently occurring paternal lineage in Western Europe. FRDA and Haplogroup R1b are more common in northern Spain, Ireland, and France, rare in Russia and Scandinavia, and follow a gradient through central and eastern Europe. A population carrying the disease went through a population bottleneck in the Franco-Cantabrian region during the last ice age.[42]",
    "Society and culture": "The Cake Eaters is a 2007 independent drama film that stars Kristen Stewart as a young woman with FRDA.[51]\nThe Ataxian is a documentary that tells the story of Kyle Bryant, an athlete with FRDA who completes a long-distance bike race in an adaptive \"trike\" to raise money for research.[52]\nDynah Haubert spoke at the 2016 Democratic National Convention about supporting Americans with disabilities.[53]\nGeraint Williams is an athlete affected by FRDA who is known for scaling Mount Kilimanjaro in an adaptive wheelchair.[54]\nShobhika Kalra is an activist with FRDA who helped build over 1000 wheelchair ramps across the United Arab Emirates in 2018 to try to  make Dubai fully wheelchair-friendly by 2020.[55]\nButterflies Still Fly is a 2023 film, based on a true story, directed by Joseph Nenci. Italo is a light-hearted journalist, darkened by a personal drama that distracts him from work. He encounters Giorgia, a young girl suffering from Friedreich's Ataxia, who will change his life.\nComedian Fiona Cauley has Friedrich's Ataxia and often talks about her disability and wheelchair in her comedy.[56]"

    "Disease": "Frontonasal dysplasia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Midfacial malformations can be subdivided into two different groups. One group with hypertelorism, this includes FND. The other with hypotelorism (a decreased distance between the eyes), this includes holoprosencephaly (failure of development of the forebrain).[5] In addition, a craniofacial cleft can be classified using the Tessier classification. Each of the clefts is numbered from 0 to 14. The 15 different types of clefts are then subdivided into 4 groups, based on their anatomical position in the face:[6] midline clefts, paramedian clefts, orbital clefts and lateral clefts. FND is a midline cleft, classified as Tessier 0/14.\nBesides this, the additional anomalies seen in FND can be subdivided by region. None of these anomalies are specific for the syndrome of FND, but they do occur more often in patients with FND than in the population. The anomalies that may be present are:\nThe clefts of the face that are present in FND are vertical clefts. These can differ in severity. When they are less severe, they often present with hypertelorism and normal brain development.[8]\nMental retardation is more likely when the hypertelorism is more severe or when extracephalic anomalies occur.[9]",
    "Causes": "Midline facial clefts are one of the symptoms in FND. These defects develop in the early stages of embryological development. This is around the 19th to 21st day of pregnancy. The cause of the defect is failure of the mesodermal migration. The mesoderm is one of the germ layers (a collection of cells that have the same embryological origin). As a result of this failure, a midline facial cleft is formed.[5]\nAnother symptom of FND is the V-shaped hairline. In the normal situation, hair growth surrounding the eyes is inhibited. However, in FND this suppression is prevented in the midline by the increased inter-ocular distance. This causes the so-called widow's peak (a V-shaped hairline) in FND patients.[9][10]\nVery early in embryogenesis, the face and neck develop. This development continues until adolescence. Organs develop out of primordia (tissue in its earliest recognizable stage of development). The developmental processes of the face and jaw structures originate from different primordia:\n[11]\nThe formation of the frontonasal process is the result of a complex signaling system which begins with the synthesis of retinoic acid (a vitamin A metabolite). This is needed to set up the facial ectodermal zone. This zone makes signaling molecules that stimulate the cell proliferation of the frontonasal process. A midfacial defect will occur if this signaling pathway is disrupted. It is suggested that the absence of this pathway will lead to the formation of a gap, and that when the pathway is working too hard, excessive tissue will be formed. FND consists of various nasal malformations that result from excessive tissue in the frontonasal process, which results in hypertelorism and a broad nasal bridge.[citation needed]\nBetween the 4th and 8th week of pregnancy, the nasomedial and maxillary processes will fuse to form the upper lip and jaw. A failure of the fusion between the maxillary and nasomedial processes results in a cleft lip. A median cleft lip is the result of a failed fusion between the two nasomedial processes.\nThe palate is formed between the 6th and 10th week of pregnancy. The primordia of the palate are the lateral palatine processes and median palatine processes. A failure of the fusion between the median and lateral palatine processes results in a cleft palate.[11]\nThere is still some discussion on whether FND is sporadic or genetic. The majority of FND cases are sporadic. Yet, some studies describe families with multiple members with FND.[3][8] Gene mutations are likely to play an important role in the cause. Unfortunately, the genetic cause for most types of FND remains undetermined.\nThe cause of frontorhiny is a mutation in the ALX3 gene. ALX3 is essential for normal facial development. Different mutations can occur in the ALX3 gene, but they all lead to the same effect: severe or complete loss of protein functionality.[8] The ALX3 mutation never occurs in a person without frontorhiny.[12]\nAcromelic frontonasal dysostosis is caused by a heterozygous mutation in the ZSWIM6 gene. It is thought that acromelic frontonasal dysostosis occurs due to an abnormality in the Sonic Hedgehog (SSH) signaling pathway. This pathway plays an important role in developing the midline central nervous system/craniofrontofacial region and the limbs. Hence, it is plausible that an error in the SSH pathway causes acromelic frontonasal dysostosis, because this syndrome not only shows abnormalities in the midfacial region, but also in the limbs and CNS.[10]",
    "Diagnosis": "The main diagnostic tools for evaluating FND are X-rays and CT-scans of the skull. These tools could display any possible intracranial pathology in FND. For example, CT can be used to reveal widening of nasal bones. Diagnostics are mainly used before reconstructive surgery, for proper planning and preparation.[8]\nPrenatally, various features of FND (such as hypertelorism) can be recognized using ultrasound techniques.[9] However, only three cases of FND have been diagnosed based on a prenatal ultrasound.[13]\nOther conditions may also show symptoms of FND. For example, there are other syndromes  that also represent with hypertelorism. Furthermore, disorders like an intracranial cyst can affect the frontonasal region, which can lead to symptoms similar to FND. Therefore, other options should always be considered in the differential diagnosis.[9]\nThe Pai Syndrome is a rare subtype of frontonasal dysplasia. It is a triad of developmental defects of the face, comprising midline cleft of the upper lip, nasal and facial skin polyps and central nervous system lipomas. When all the cases are compared, a difference in severity of the midline cleft of the upper lip can be seen. The mild form presents with just a gap between the upper teeth. The severe group presents with a complete cleft of the upper lip and alveolar ridge.[5]\nNervous system lipomas are rare congenital benign tumors of the central nervous system, mostly located in the medial line and especially in the corpus callosum. Generally, patients with these lipomas present with strokes. However, patients with the Pai syndrome don't. That is why it is suggested that isolated nervous system lipomas have a different embryological origin than the lipomas present in the Pai syndrome. The treatment of CNS lipomas mainly consists of observation and follow up.[5]\nSkin lipomas occur relatively often in the normal population. However, facial and nasal lipomas are rare, especially in childhood. However, the Pai syndrome often present with facial and nasal polyps.[14] These skin lipomas are benign, and are therefore more a cosmetic problem than a functional problem.\nThe skin lipomas can develop on different parts of the face. The most common place is the nose. Other common places are the forehead, the conjunctivae and the frenulum linguae. The amount of skin lipomas is not related to the severity of the midline clefting.[5]\nPatients with the Pai syndrome have a normal neuropsychological development.\nUntil today there is no known cause for the Pai syndrome.\nThe large variety in phenotypes make the Pai syndrome difficult to diagnose. Thus the incidence of Pai syndrome seems to be underestimated.[14]\nAcromelic frontonasal dysplasia is a rare subtype of FND. It has an autosomal dominant inheritance. Acromelic frontonasal dysplasia is associated with central nervous system malformations and limb defects including a clubfoot, an underdeveloped shin-bone, and preaxial polydactyly of the feet. Preaxial polydactyly is a condition in which there are too many toes on the side of the big toe.[10] The phenotype of AFND is severe: a type Ia DeMyer and a Sedano type D. In contrast to the other subtypes of FND, AFND has a relatively high frequency of underlying malformations of the brain.[15]\nFrontorhiny is another subtype of FND. It consists of multiple characteristics. Patient are characterized by: hypertelorism, a wide nasal bridge, a split nasal tip, a broad columella (strip of skin running from the tip of the nose to the upper lip), widely separated narrow nostrils, a long philtrum (vertical groove on the upper lip) and two-sided nasal swellings.[8]\nFrontorhiny is one of the two subtypes of FND where a genetic mutation has been determined. The mutation has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. The syndrome is often seen in siblings and, most of the time, parents are carriers. See Genetics.[16]\nCraniofrontonasal dysplasia (CFND) is a rare type of FND with X linked inheritance. Multiple features are characteristic for CFND such as craniosynostosis of the coronal sutures (prematurely closed cranial sutures), dry frizzy curled hair, splitting of the nails and facial asymmetry.[citation needed]\nThere is a large variety in phenotype. Women present with a more severe phenotype than men. Females characteristically have FND, craniosynostosis and additional small malformations. Males are usually more mildly affected, presenting with only hypertelorism. The gene that causes CFND is called EFNB1 and is located on the X chromosome. A hypothesis for the more severe outcome in females is based on X-inactivation, which leads to mosaicism. As a result, patients have less functional cells, generating abnormal tissue boundaries, termed \"cellular interference\". This process almost never occurs in males, as they have less mutagenic material in their genes.[clarification needed] EFBN1 also has an important function in males.[16] As the syndrome has an X-linked inheritance pattern, there is no man-to-man inheritance.[3][7]\nOAFNS is a combination of FND and oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum (OAVS).[17]\nThe diagnosis of OAVS is based on the following facial characteristics: microtia (underdeveloped external ear), preauricular tags, facial asymmetry, mandibular hypoplasia and epibulbar lipodermoids (benign tumor of the eye which consists of adipose and fibrous tissue).\nThere still remains discussion about the classification and the minimal amount of characteristics.  When someone presents with FND and the characteristics of OAVS, the diagnosis OAFNS may be made.[17]\nAs the incidence of OAFNS is unknown, there are probably a lot of children with mild phenotypes that aren't being diagnosed as being OAFNS.[17]\nThe cause of OAFNS is unknown, but there are some theories about the genesis. Autosomal recessive inheritance is suggested because of a case with two affected siblings [18] and a case with consanguineous parents.[19] However, another study shows that it is more plausible that OAFNS is sporadic.[20]\nIt is known that maternal diabetes plays a role in developing malformations of craniofacial structures and in OAVS. Therefore, it is suggested as a cause of OAFNS. Folate deficiency is also suggested as possible mechanism.[17]\nLow-dose CT protocols should be considered in diagnosing children with OAFNS.[17]",
    "Treatment": "Because newborns can breathe only through their nose, the main goal of postnatal treatment is to establish a proper airway.[21] Primary surgical treatment of FND can already be performed at the age of 6 months, but most surgeons wait for the children to reach the age of 6 to 8 years. This decision is made because then the neurocranium and orbits have developed to 90% of their eventual form. Furthermore, the dental placement in the jaw has been finalized around this age.[21][22]\nTo correct the rather prominent hypertelorism, wide nasal root and midline cleft in FND, a facial bipartition can be performed. This surgery is preferred to periorbital box-osteotomy because deformities are corrected with a better aesthetic result.[22]\nDuring the operation, the orbits are disconnected from the skull and the base of the skull. However, they remain attached to the upper jaw. Part of the forehead in the centre of the face is removed (median faciotomy) in the process. Then, the orbits are rotated internally, to correct the hypertelorism. Often, a new nasal bone will have to be interpositioned, using a bone transplant.\nComplications of this procedure are: bleeding, meningitis, cerebrospinal fluid leakage and blindness.[23]\nStructural nasal deformities are corrected during or shortly after the facial bipartition surgery. In this procedure, bone grafts are used to reconstruct the nasal bridge. However, a second procedure is often needed after the development of the nose has been finalized (at the age of 14 years or even later).\nSecondary rhinoplasty is based mainly on a nasal augmentation, since it has been proven better to add tissue to the nose than to remove tissue. This is caused by the minimal capacity of contraction of the nasal skin after surgery.[24]\nIn rhinoplasty, the use of autografts (tissue from the same person as the surgery is performed on) is preferred. However, this is often made impossible by the relative damage done by previous surgery. In those cases, bone tissue from the skull or the ribs is used. However, this may give rise to serious complications such as fractures, resorption of the bone, or a flattened nasofacial angle.To prevent these complications, an implant made out of alloplastic material could be considered. Implants take less surgery time, are limitlessly available and may have more favorable characteristics than autografts. However, possible risks are rejection, infection, migration of the implant, or unpredictable changes in the physical appearance in the long term.[citation needed]\nAt the age of skeletal maturity, orthognathic surgery may be needed because of the often hypoplastic maxilla. Skeletal maturity is at the age of six reached around the age of 13 to 16. Orthognathic surgery engages in diagnosing and treating disorders of the face and teeth- and jaw position.[21]"

    "Disease": "Fucosidosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Symptoms are highly variable, with mild cases being able to live to within the third or fourth decade.[5]\nSymptoms include:[6]\nSevere cases can develop life-threatening complications early in childhood. In the more severe forms (type 1), \"patients have no vascular lesions, but have rapid psychomotor regression, severe and rapidly progressing neurologic signs, elevated sodium and chloride excretion in the sweat, and fatal outcome before the sixth year.\"[7]\nMore severe forms are linked with mental retardation.[5]",
    "Causes": "Fucosidosis is an autosomal recessive disorder that affects many areas of the body. Mutations in the FUCA1 gene cause fucosidosis. The FUCA1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called alpha-L-fucosidase. The enzyme plays a role in the breakdown of complex sugars in the body.[3] The deficiency of the enzyme alpha-L-fucosidase, which is used to metabolize complex compounds in the body (fucose-containing glycolipids and fucose-containing glycoproteins), leads to lysosomal accumulation of a variety of glycoproteins, glycolipids, and oligosaccharides that contain fucose moieties.[2][4] The result is incomplete breakdown of glycolipids and glycoproteins. These partially broken down compounds accumulate in various parts of the body and begin to cause malfunction in cells,[3] and can eventually cause cell death. Brain cells are especially sensitive to this buildup. Other results are progressive neurological deterioration, skin abnormalities, growth retardation, skeletal disease, and coarsening of facial features.[2] Fucosidosis is the consequence of faulty degradation of both sphingolipids and polysaccharides. Major accumulation of the H-antigen (a member of the ABO blood group antigens), a glycolipid, is seen primarily in the liver of fucosidosis patients; some researchers have speculated that blood type may play a role in the course of the disease.[4][8]",
    "Diagnosis": "A special urine test is available to check for any partially broken-down sugars. If they are present, a skin or blood sample will be taken to test for below-normal amounts of alpha-fucosidase.[2]\nFucosidosis is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means that both parents have to have the mutation and pass it on to the child. When both parents have the mutation, there is a 25% chance of each child having fucosidosis.[2]\nThe condition was traditionally separated by type, with type 1 beginning sooner, progressing more quickly, and being more severe, and type 2 being milder and progressing more slowly; a third, even milder form has also been recognized.[5] Fucosidosis is now considered to be a single disorder and \"represents a disease spectrum with a wide variety of expression.\"[9] More severe forms (type 1) appear in the first 3 to 18 months of life, while milder forms typically appear between 12 and 24 months.[6]",
    "Treatment": "There is no treatment or way to reverse the disease; treatment instead focuses on the individual's symptoms, such as seizure medication.[10]\nResearch into bone marrow transplants, in an attempt to improve enzyme activity, is ongoing as of 2023[update].[9]"

    "Disease": "Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy",
    "Signs and symptoms": "In terms of the signs/symptoms of Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy it is characterized by a decrease in skeletal muscle tone as well as an impairment in brain and eye development. Initial symptoms of FCMD present in early infancy as decreased ability to feed.  Marked differences in facial appearance occur due to decreased muscle tone. Further characteristics include:[2]\nFukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy also affects the nervous system and various associated parts.  FCMD affects normal development of the brain producing a broadly smooth, bumpy shaped cortex named cobblestone lissencephaly as well as various other malformations, notably micropolygyria. Children also experience delayed myelination in the brain.[8]",
    "Causes": "The cause of Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy is rooted in the FKTN gene, located at human chromosome 9q31, encoding  the protein fukutin.  Mutations in this gene, and therefore the fukutin protein, are the cause of FCMD.[9] The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.[5]\nThis means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome (chromosome 9 is an autosome), and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder.[10]\nTwo mutations have been identified. The first and most common is an SVA retrotransposal insertion in the 3'-untranslated region. The second is a deep-intronic point mutation c.647+2084G>T. This second mutation has only been found to date in the presence of the first mutation.[11]",
    "Diagnosis": "Serum creatine kinase concentration and muscle biopsies can be obtained to help determine if the individual has FMCD.  FKTN molecular genetic testing is used to determine a mutation in the FKTN gene after a serum creatine kinase concentration, muscle biopsies, and/or MRI imaging have presented abnormalities indicative of FCMD, the presence of the symptoms indicates Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy.  The available genetic test include:[2][4]",
    "Treatment": "Currently this sub-type of muscular dystrophy has no cure and no definitive treatment exists.[14]  Treatment offers preventative tactics to delay muscle breakdown and increase life expectancy.  Stretching and physical therapy can increase mobility.  Treatment also includes correcting skeletal abnormalities through orthopedic surgery and other orthopedic techniques. Antiepileptic medication is administered to help prevent seizures.  ACE inhibitors and beta blockers help treat heart conditions, and respiratory assistance is more than likely needed at some point for the affected individual.[2][14][15]",
    "Prognosis": "Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy has a poor prognosis.  Most children with FCMD reach a maximum mobility at sitting upright and sliding. Due to the compounded effects of continually worsening heart problems, impaired mental development, problems swallowing and additional complications, children with FCMD rarely live through adolescence, the disorder proves fatal by age 20.[2][16]"

  {
    "Disease": "Galactosialidosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The signs and symptoms of galactosialidosis range from mild to severe, and can vary amongst patients depending on the age of the individual when symptoms begin as well as the specific subtype of disease each person has.[4]  Symptoms can also vary amongst individuals within the same subtype, but it is known that the earlier a person shows symptoms, the more severe the disease tends to progress over time.[citation needed]\nIndividuals who are diagnosed with early infantile galactosialidosis have symptoms that present just before or after birth and tend to be most severe.  The most common symptoms include abnormal fluid build-up, hepatosplenomegaly, enlarged heart, abnormal bone development, kidney disease that progressively worsens, coarse facial features, and a cherry red spot on the back of the eye.[3]\nThose who are diagnosed with late infantile subtype have symptoms that are similar to early infantile, except that they present around six months of age and tend to be less severe.  Additional symptoms in this subtype can include growth problems, hearing or vision problems, and seizures.[3]\nJuvenile/adult subtype symptoms include impaired balance or coordination, dark red spots on the skin or angiokeratomas, vision loss, seizures,  and muscle jerks or myoclonus. The symptoms of this subtype tend to be less severe than the first two subtypes, and typically start in adolescence, with the average age being 16 years of age.[5]",
    "Causes": "Galactosialidosis is caused by a mutation in the CTSA gene.  This gene encodes the enzyme cathepsin A,[6] which forms a protein complex with neuraminidase-1 and beta-galactosidase to break down fats, sugars, and proteins ingested by lysosomes.[4]  Cathepsin A is required in this process because within the complex, it prevents neuraminidase-1 and beta-galactosidase from breaking down prematurely, so that they may perform their functions properly.  When the CTSA gene is mutated, the protein structure of cathepsin A is defective, making it incapable of binding to other proteins or forming complexes.  This leads to a deficiency of beta-galactosidase (GLB1) and neuraminidase-1 (NEU1).[7] As a result, the lysosome is unable to break down toxic substances and waste builds up within the cell.[citation needed]\nAll individuals diagnosed with galactosialidosis have inherited the condition in an autosomal recessive manner, regardless of age or subtype. All genes consist of two copies, one received from each parent.  When a disease is recessive, it means that two mutated copies of a gene are required for someone to inherit the trait or disorder.[8]  When each parent carries one mutated copy of the same gene, there is a 25% possibility that their offspring will inherit both copies of the gene and develop the disease.  In galactosialidosis, both parents of the patient would have carried a mutated copy of the CTSA gene. The affected child inherits both copies, leading to the development of the disease.[citation needed]\nThere are no known environmental or medical associations related to the cause of galactosialidosis.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "When the characteristic symptoms of galactosialidosis are suspected, patients can undergo specific testing to confirm their diagnosis.  One common method includes enzyme assays which measure the activity of neuraminidase-1 and beta-galactosidase.[4] Decreased levels in enzymatic activity indicate a deficiency in cathepsin A.  A complete urinalysis can be performed to detect the presence of oligosaccharides,[4] which would pass through the urine as excess amounts accumulate within cells due to lysosomal dysfunction. [citation needed]\nA diagnosis can more specifically be confirmed through molecular genetic analysis, which is used to identify a mutation in the CTSA gene.  Once a mutation is detected, the results are combined with a clinical exam and patient symptoms to fully diagnose galactosialidosis.[3]  The age of the patient at the onset of symptoms is used to determine the specific disease subtype of the patient.[3] Early infantile patients are diagnosed between birth and 3 months of age, late infantile patients are diagnosed between 3–12 months of age, and juvenile/adult patients are normally diagnosed in adolescence when symptoms begin.[9]\nA prenatal diagnosis was made by Kleijer et al. in 1979 by measuring beta-galactosidase and neuraminidase activities in cultured amniotic fluid cells.[10]",
    "Treatment": "Currently, there is no cure for galactosialidosis.  However, there are treatments available that help to manage symptoms and provide supportive care.[9]  For example, a treatment plan may include medications to control seizures or muscle jerks.  It is also common for patients to establish routine care with a medical geneticist, neurologist, and ophthalmologist[3] depending on the symptoms they are experiencing and the frequency at which they occur.",
    "Prognosis": "The prognosis of individuals diagnosed with galactosialidosis varies between patients, depending on age and severity of symptoms.  Therefore, there is no established average age at which patients die or have an increased risk of death.  There is no chance of full recovery in any form of the disease.[citation needed]\nPatients diagnosed with early infantile subtype have more severe, threatening symptoms and a decreased chance of survival because this subtype develops more rapidly;[4] however, it is noted that most patients do live into late infancy.[9]\nBecause patients with the late infantile subtype develop symptoms within the first year of life, their condition is not as severe as the early infantile subtype and the chance of survival is higher; however, the quality of life is still greatly affected because the patient is so young when symptoms occur.  The patient will still require a detailed care plan to manage symptoms.[3]\nPatients diagnosed with the juvenile/adult subtype have less severe symptoms but will have to manage progressive mental disability, spinal deformities, and seizures amongst other common symptoms.  However, this subtype is typically associated with a normal life expectancy.[9]",
    "Epidemiology": "Galactosialidosis is considered a very rare disease, though its prevalence is not exactly known.  Less than 150 cases have been reported in the literature; of that population, about 60% of cases were of the juvenile/adult subtype[5] with symptoms beginning at or after 16 years of age.

    "Disease": "Gestational trophoblastic disease",
    "Causes": "Two main risk factors increase the likelihood for the development of GTD: 1) The woman being under 20 years of age, or over 35 years of age, and 2) previous GTD.[9][10][11]\nAlthough molar pregnancies affect women of all ages, women under 16 and over 45 years of age have an increased risk of developing a molar pregnancy.[12]\nHydatidiform moles are abnormal conceptions with excessive placental development. Conception takes place, but placental tissue grows very fast, rather than supporting the growth of a fetus.[13][14][15]\nComplete hydatidiform moles have no fetal tissue and no maternal DNA, as a result of a maternal ovum with no functional DNA. Most commonly, a single spermatozoon duplicates and fertilises an empty ovum. Less commonly, two separate spermatozoa fertilise an empty ovum (dispermic fertilisation).\nPartial hydatidiform moles have a fetus or fetal cells. They are triploid in origin, containing one set of maternal haploid genes and two sets of paternal haploid genes. They almost always occur following dispermic fertilisation of a normal ovum. Malignant forms of GTD are very rare. About 50% of malignant forms of GTD develop from a hydatidiform mole.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "Cases of GTD can be diagnosed through routine tests given during pregnancy, such as blood tests and ultrasound, or through tests done after miscarriage or abortion.[16] Vaginal bleeding, enlarged uterus, pelvic pain or discomfort, and vomiting too much (hyperemesis) are the most common symptoms of GTD. But GTD also leads to elevated serum hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin hormone). Since pregnancy is by far the most common cause of elevated serum hCG, clinicians generally first suspect a pregnancy with a complication. However, in GTD, the beta subunit of hCG (beta hCG) is also always elevated. Therefore, if GTD is clinically suspected, serum beta hCG is also measured.[17]\nThe initial clinical diagnosis of GTD should be confirmed histologically, which can be done after the evacuation of pregnancy (see Treatment below) in women with hydatidiform mole.[18] However, malignant GTD is highly vascular. If malignant GTD is suspected clinically, biopsy is contraindicated, because biopsy may cause life-threatening haemorrhage.\nWomen with persistent abnormal vaginal bleeding after any pregnancy, and women developing acute respiratory or neurological symptoms after any pregnancy, should also undergo hCG testing, because these may be signs of a hitherto undiagnosed GTD.\nThere might be some signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism as well as an increase in the levels of thyroid hormones in some patients. The proposed mechanism is attaching hCG to TSH receptors and acting like TSH weakly.[19]\nBoth are composed of intermediate trophoblast, but their morphological features and clinical presentation can differ significantly.\nExaggerated placental site is a benign, non cancerous lesion with an increased number of implantation site intermediate trophoblastic cells that infiltrate the endometrium and the underlying myometrium. An exaggerated placental site may occur with normal pregnancy, or after an abortion. No specific treatment or follow up is necessary.\nPlacental site nodules are lesions of chorionic type intermediate trophoblast, usually small. 40–50% of placental site nodules are found in the cervix. They almost always are incidental findings after a surgical procedure. No specific treatment or follow up is necessary.",
    "Treatment": "Treatment is always necessary.[21]\nThe treatment for hydatidiform mole consists of the evacuation of pregnancy.[22][23][24][25][26] Evacuation will lead to the relief of symptoms, and also prevent later complications. Suction curettage is the preferred method of evacuation. Hysterectomy is an alternative if no further pregnancies are wished for by the female patient. Hydatidiform mole also has successfully been treated with systemic (intravenous) methotrexate.[27]\nThe treatment for invasive mole or choriocarcinoma generally is the same. Both are usually treated with chemotherapy. Methotrexate and dactinomycin are among the chemotherapy drugs used in GTD.[28][29][30][31] In women with low risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia, a review has found that Actinomycin D is probably more effective as a treatment and more likely to achieve a cure in the first instance than methotrexate.[32] Only a few women with GTD have poor prognosis metastatic gestational trophoblastic disease. Their treatment usually includes chemotherapy. Radiotherapy can also be given to places where the cancer has spread, e.g. the brain.[33]\nWomen who undergo chemotherapy are advised not to conceive for one year after completion of treatment. These women also are likely to have an earlier menopause. It has been estimated by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists that the age at menopause for women who receive single agent chemotherapy is advanced by one year, and by three years for women who receive multi agent chemotherapy.[citation needed]\nFollow up is necessary in all women with gestational trophoblastic disease, because of the possibility of persistent disease, or because of the risk of developing malignant uterine invasion or malignant metastatic disease even after treatment in some women with certain risk factors.[34][35]\nThe use of a reliable contraception method is very important during the entire follow up period, as patients are strongly advised against pregnancy at that time. If a reliable contraception method is not used during the follow-up, it could be initially unclear to clinicians as to whether a rising hCG level is caused by the patient becoming pregnant again, or by the continued presence of GTD.[citation needed]\nIn women who have a malignant form of GTD, hCG concentrations stay the same (plateau) or they rise. Persistent elevation of serum hCG levels after a non molar pregnancy (i.e., normal pregnancy [term pregnancy], or preterm pregnancy, or ectopic pregnancy [pregnancy taking place in the wrong place, usually in the fallopian tube], or abortion) always indicate persistent GTD (very frequently due to choriocarcinoma or placental site trophoblastic tumour), but this is not common, because treatment mostly is successful.\nIn rare cases, a previous GTD may be reactivated after a subsequent pregnancy, even after several years. Therefore, the hCG tests should be performed also after any subsequent pregnancy in all women who had had a previous GTD (6 and 10 weeks after the end of any subsequent pregnancy).",
    "Prognosis": "Women with a hydatidiform mole have an excellent prognosis. Women with a malignant form of GTD usually have a very good prognosis.[36]\nChoriocarcinoma, for example, is an uncommon, yet almost always curable cancer. Although choriocarcinoma is a highly malignant tumour and a life-threatening disease, it is very sensitive to chemotherapy. Virtually all women with non-metastatic disease are cured and retain their fertility; the prognosis is also very good for those with metastatic (spreading) cancer, in the early stages, but fertility may be lost. Hysterectomy (surgical removal of the uterus) can also be offered[37] to patients > 40 years of age or those for whom sterilisation is not an obstacle. Only a few women with GTD have a poor prognosis, e.g. some forms of stage IV GTN. The FIGO staging system is used.[38] The risk can be estimated by scoring systems such as the Modified WHO Prognostic Scoring System, wherein scores between 1 and 4 from various parameters are summed together:[39]\nIn this scoring system, women with a score of 7 or greater are considered at high risk.\nIt is very important for malignant forms of GTD to be discovered in time. In Western countries, women with molar pregnancies are followed carefully; for instance, in the UK, all women who have had a molar pregnancy are registered at the National Trophoblastic Screening Centre.[40] There are efforts in this direction in the developing countries too, and there have been improvements in these countries in the early detection of choriocarcinoma, thereby significantly reducing the mortality rate also in  developing countries.[41][42][43]\nMost women with GTD can become pregnant again and can have children again. The risk of a further molar pregnancy is low. More than 98% of women who become pregnant following a molar pregnancy will not have a further hydatidiform mole or be at increased risk of complications.[citation needed]\nIn the past, it was seen as important not to get pregnant straight away after a GTD. Specialists recommended a waiting period of six months after the hCG levels become normal. Recently, this standpoint has been questioned. New medical data suggest that a significantly shorter waiting period after the hCG levels become normal is reasonable for approximately 97% of the patients with hydatidiform mole.[44]\nThe risk of a repeat GTD is approximately 1 in 100, compared with approximately 1 in 1000 risk in the general population. Especially women whose hCG levels remain significantly elevated are at risk of developing a repeat GTD.[45]\nThe term «persistent trophoblastic disease» (PTD) is used when after treatment of a molar pregnancy, some molar tissue is left behind and again starts growing into a tumour. Although PTD can spread within the body like a malignant cancer, the overall cure rate is nearly 100%.[46]\nIn the vast majority of patients, treatment of PTD consist of chemotherapy. Only about 10% of patients with PTD can be treated successfully with a second curettage.[47][48]\nIn some very rare cases, a GTD can coexist with a normal fetus. This is called a \"twin pregnancy\". These cases should be managed only by experienced clinics, after extensive consultation with the patient. Because successful term delivery might be possible, the pregnancy should be allowed to proceed if the mother wishes, following appropriate counselling. The probability of achieving a healthy baby is approximately 40%, but there is a risk of complications, e.g. pulmonary embolism and pre-eclampsia. Compared with women who simply had a GTD in the past, there is no increased risk of developing persistent GTD after such a twin pregnancy.[49][50][51][52][53][54]\nIn few cases, a GTD had coexisted with a normal pregnancy, but this was discovered only incidentally after a normal birth.[55]",
    "Epidemiology": "Overall, GTD is a rare disease. Nevertheless, the incidence of GTD varies greatly between different parts of the world. The reported incidence of hydatidiform mole ranges from 23 to 1299 cases per 100,000 pregnancies. The incidence of the malignant forms of GTD is much lower, only about 10% of the incidence of hydatidiform mole.[56] The reported incidence of GTD from Europe and North America is significantly lower than the reported incidence of GTD from Asia and South America.[57][58][59][60] One proposed reason for this great geographical variation is differences in healthy diet in the different parts of the world (e.g., carotene deficiency).[61]\nHowever, the incidence of rare diseases (such as GTD) is difficult to measure, because epidemiologic data on rare diseases is limited. Not all cases will be reported, and some cases will not be recognised. In addition, in GTD, this is especially difficult, because one would need to know all gestational events in the total population. Yet, it seems very likely that the estimated number of births that occur at home or outside of a hospital has been inflated in some reports.[62]"

    "Disease": "Glanzmann%27s thrombasthenia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Characteristically, there is increased mucosal bleeding:[3]\nThe bleeding tendency is variable but may be severe. Bleeding into the joints, particularly spontaneous bleeds, are very rare, in contrast to the hemophilias. Platelet numbers and morphology are normal. Platelet aggregation is normal with ristocetin, but impaired with other agonists such as ADP, thrombin, collagen, or epinephrine.[citation needed]",
    "Causes": "Glanzmann's thrombasthenia can be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner[3][4] or acquired as an autoimmune disorder.[3][5]\nThe bleeding tendency in Glanzmann's thrombasthenia is variable,[3] some individuals having minimal bruising, while others have frequent, severe, potentially fatal hemorrhages. Moreover, platelet αIIbβ3 levels correlate poorly with hemorrhagic severity, as virtually undetectable αIIbβ3 levels can correlate with negligible bleeding symptoms, and 10–15% levels can correlate with severe bleeding.[6] Unidentified factors other than the platelet defect itself may have important roles.[3]",
    "Diagnosis": "Light transmission aggregometry is widely accepted as the gold standard diagnostic tool for assessing platelet function, and a result of absent aggregation with any agonist except ristocetin is highly specific for Glanzmann's thrombasthenia.[9] Following is a table comparing its result with other platelet aggregation disorders:",
    "Treatment": "Therapy involves both preventive measures and treatment of specific bleeding episodes.[3]"

    "Disease": "Glutaric aciduria type 1",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The severity of glutaric acidemia type 1 varies widely; some individuals are only mildly affected, while others suffer severe problems. GA1 can be defined as two clinical entities: GA-1 diagnosed at birth or pre-birth and managed through dietary restrictions, and GA-1 diagnosed after an encephalopathic crisis. A crisis may occur under both headings, but the care of individuals diagnosed before a crisis can be managed to avoid most or all injury.[citation needed]\nBabies with glutaric acidemia type 1 often are born with unusually large heads (macrocephaly). Macrocephaly is amongst the earliest signs of GA1. It is thus important to investigate all cases of macrocephaly of unknown origins for GCDH deficiency,[2][3] given the importance of the early diagnosis of GA1.[4]\nMacrocephaly is a pivotal clinical sign of many neurological diseases. Physicians and parents should be aware of the benefits of investigating for an underlying neurological disorder, particularly a neurometabolic one, in children with head circumferences in the highest percentiles.[5]\nAffected individuals may have difficulty moving and may experience spasms, jerking, rigidity or decreased muscle tone and muscle weakness (which may be the result of secondary carnitine deficiency). GA, in patients who have suffered a crisis, can be defined as a cerebral palsy of genetic origins.[citation needed][clarification needed]\nA common way to manage striatal necrosis is to provide special seating. These special wheelchairs are designed to limit abnormal movements. However, spasticity can be worsened by constraint. Parents and caregivers can provide a more interactive occupational therapy by enabling the child to use his or her own excessive postural muscle tone to his or her own advantage (see picture; note the care with which minimal pressure is applied while ensuring safety).[citation needed]\nThe excessive tone can also be managed with hanging doorway baby exercisers and other aids to the upright stance that do not constrain the child but help him or her gradually tone down the rigidity.[citation needed]\nSome individuals with glutaric acidemia have developed bleeding in the brain or eyes that could be mistaken for the effects of child abuse.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "Normally, magnetic resonance imaging shows the Sylvian fissure to be operculated, but in GA1-associated encephalopathy, operculation is absent.  In many jurisdictions, GA1 is included in newborn screening panels.  Elevated glutarylcarnitine can be detected by mass spectrometry in a dried blood spot collected shortly after birth.  After a positive screening result, confirmatory testing is performed.  This includes urine organic acid analysis, looking for glutaric acid and 3-hydroxyglutaric acid.  Plasma and urine acylcarnitine analysis can also be informative.  Molecular analysis, including gene sequencing and copy number analysis of GCDH, can be performed to confirm the diagnosis.  Molecular testing can also provide information for family planning and prenatal testing, if desired.[citation needed]",

    "Prognosis": "A 2006 study of 279 patients found that of those with symptoms (185, 66%), 95% had suffered an encephalopathic crises, usually with following brain damage. Of the participants in the study, 49 children died and the median age of death was 6.6 years. A Kaplan–Meier analysis of the data estimated that about 50% of symptomatic people would die by the age of 25.[13]\nMore recent studies provide an updated prognosis whereby individuals affected can, through proper dietary management and carnitine supplementation, manage the disease with a much improved prognosis.  Newborn screening has allowed affected patients to avoid crises and live full lives without any injury to the brain. It is essential that patients with the disease be diagnosed at or before birth and that all variables be strictly managed in order to maintain quality of life.  When suspected and in the absence of confirmed diagnosis (through genetic sequencing), it is critical that the individual maintain a diet restrictive of all proteins and that blood sugars be monitored rigorously.  The WHO now considers this disease entirely manageable.[18]",
    "Epidemiology": "GA1 can be described as a metabolic disorder, a neurometabolic disease, a cerebral palsy or a basal ganglia disorder (it may also be misdiagnosed as shaken baby syndrome).\nDepending on the paradigm adopted, GA1 will mostly be managed with precursor restriction or with neurorehabilitation.[citation needed]\nSo-called \"orphan diseases\", such as GA1, can be adopted into wider groups of diseases (such as carnitine deficiency diseases, cerebral palsies of diverse origins, basal ganglia disorders, and others); Morton at al. (2003b) emphasize that acute striatal necrosis is a distinctive pathologic feature of at least 20 other disorders of very different etiologies, including, HIV encephalopathy–AIDS dementia complex, pneumococcal meningitis, hypoadrenal crisis, methylmalonic acidemia, propionic acidemia, middle cerebral artery occlusion, hypertensive vasculopathy, acute Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection, 3-nitropropionic acid intoxication, late-onset familial dystonia, cerebrovascular abrupt and severe neonatal asphyxia (\"selective neuronal necrosis\").[citation needed]\nIn a cohort of 279 patients who had been reported to have GA1, 185 were symptomatic (two-thirds); being symptomatic was seen as an indication of low treatment efficacy. Screening of those known to be at high risk, neonatal population screening and a diagnosis of macrocephaly are the ways to identify bearers of the GCDH mutation who are not frankly symptomatic. Macrocephaly remains the main sign of GA1 for those who have no relatives with GA1 and have not been included in a population screening program. GA1 is considered a treatable disease.[13]\nTwo-thirds of the patients who have GA1 encephalopathy will receive little benefit from the treatment for GA1 but can benefit from treatments given to victims of middle cerebral artery occlusion, AIDS dementia and other basal ganglia disorders: brain implants, stem cell neurorestoration, growth factors, monoaminergic agents, and many other neurorehabilitation strategies.[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "Glycine encephalopathy",
    "Signs and symptoms": "It typically presents as a severe encephalopathy with myoclonic seizures, is rapidly progressive and eventually results in respiratory arrest. Standard evaluation for inborn errors of metabolism and other causes of this presentation does not reveal any abnormality (no acidosis, no hypoglycaemia, or hyperammonaemia and no other organ affected). Pronounced and sustained hiccups in an encephalopathic infant have been described as a typical observation in non-ketotic hyperglycinaemia.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "There are several different forms of glycine encephalopathy, which can be distinguished by the age of onset, as well as the types and severity of symptoms. All forms of glycine encephalopathy present with only neurological symptoms, including intellectual disability (IQ scores below 20 are common[6]), hypotonia, apneic seizures, and brain malformations.[1]: 811\nWith the classical, or neonatal presentation of glycine encephalopathy, the infant is born after an unremarkable pregnancy, but presents with lethargy, hypotonia, apneic seizures and myoclonic jerks, which can progress to apnea requiring artificial ventilation, and often death. Apneic patients can regain spontaneous respiration in their second to third week of life. After recovery from the initial episode, patients have intractable seizures and profound intellectual disability, remaining developmentally delayed. Some mothers comment retrospectively that they noticed fetal rhythmic \"hiccuping\" episodes during pregnancy, most likely reflecting seizure episodes in utero.[4] Patients with the infantile form of glycine encephalopathy do not show lethargy and coma in the neonatal period, but often have a history of hypotonia. They often have seizures, which can range in severity and responsiveness to treatment, and they are typically developmentally delayed.[7] Glycine encephalopathy can also present as a milder form with episodic seizures, ataxia, movement disorders, and gaze palsy during febrile illness. These patients are also developmentally delayed, to varying degrees. In the later onset form, patients typically have normal intellectual function, but present with spastic diplegia and optic atrophy.[7] The mild form of the disorder corresponds to greatly reduced but not fully absent GCS activity.[8]\nTransient neonatal hyperglycinemia has been described in a very small number of cases. Initially, these patients present with the same symptoms and laboratory results that are seen in the classical presentation. However, levels of glycine in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid typically normalize within eight weeks, and in five of six cases there were no neurological issues detected at follow-up times up to thirteen years. A single patient was severely retarded at nine months. The suspected cause of transient neonatal hyperglicinemia is attributed to low activity of the glycine cleavage system in the immature brain and liver of the neonate.[4]",
    "Treatment": "A treatment of sodium benzoate, which binds to glycine and forms hippurate, and dextromethorphan, which weakly inhibits the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors that glycine acts on has been shown to improve outcomes in select cases where the disorder is present in attenuated form.[8]",
    "Prognosis": "The prognosis is very poor. Two studies reported typical age of deaths in infancy or early childhood, with the first reporting a median age of death of 2.6 for boys and less than 1 month for girls.[9][6]",
    "Society and culture": "NKH is a rare disease but maintains a very active community presence for educating parents with newly diagnosed children and fundraising for genetic therapy. Charities and support groups in the space include The Mikaere Foundation, Jack Richard Urban Foundation and the NKH Crusaders."

  {
    "Disease": "Glycogen storage disease type II",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The infantile-onset (IOPD) form usually comes to medical attention within the first few months of life, either clinically or through newborn screening. The usual presenting features are cardiomyopathy, cardiomegaly, hypotonia, respiratory distress, muscle weakness, feeding difficulties, and failure to thrive.[2][citation needed]\nIOPD patients can be further classified by Cross-Reactive Immunological Material (CRIM) status which is an important predictor of clinical response.[3] Patients that produce no GAA protein are referred to as CRIM negative. Therefore, they can develop highly sustained antibody titers for enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Immunomodulation or immunotherapy is an effective treatment to prevent an immune response to ERT.\nThe main clinical findings include floppy baby appearance, delayed motor milestones, and feeding difficulties. Moderate hepatomegaly may or may not be present. Facial features include macroglossia, hypernasal speech, hearing loss, and myopathic facies. Cardiopulmonary involvement is manifested by increased respiratory rate, use of accessory muscles for respiration, recurrent chest infections, decreased air entry in the left lower zone (due to cardiomegaly), arrhythmias, and evidence of heart failure.[citation needed]\nBefore the development of a treatment, the median age at death in untreated cases was 8.7 months, usually due to cardiorespiratory failure. However, this outcome has drastically changed since enzyme replacement therapy became available, improving with early initiation of treatment.\nThe Late-onset (LOPD) form differs from the infantile-onset principally in the relative lack of cardiac involvement. The onset has a slower progression and can present at any decade of life. Cardiac involvement may occur but is milder than in the infantile form. Skeletal involvement is more prominent with a predilection for the lower limbs.[citation needed]\nLate-onset features include impaired cough, recurrent chest infections, hypotonia, progressive muscle weakness, delayed motor milestones, difficulty swallowing or chewing, and reduced vital capacity.\nVariability in the age of onset, severity, and symptoms, between those as genetically similar as identical twins, indicates that there may be epigenetic - or secondary factors - influencing disease presentation.[4]\nPrognosis depends on the age of onset of symptoms with a better prognosis being associated with later onset disease.[citation needed]",
    "Causes": "Pompe disease has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. This means the defective gene is located on an autosome, and two faulty copies of the gene—one from each parent—are required to be born with the disorder. As with all cases of autosomal recessive inheritance, children have a one in four chance of inheriting the disorder when both parents carry the defective gene, and although both parents carry one copy of the defective gene, they are usually unaffected by the disorder.[citation needed]\nThe disease is caused by a mutation in a gene (acid alpha-glucosidase: also known as acid maltase) on the long arm of chromosome 17 at 17q25.2-q25.3 (base pair 75,689,876 to 75,708,272). The number of mutations described is currently (in 2010) 289 with 67 being non-pathogenic mutations and 197 pathogenic mutations. The remainder are still being evaluated for their association with disease.[citation needed]\nThe gene spans approximately 20 kb and contains 20 exons with the first exon being noncoding. The coding sequence of the putative catalytic site domain is interrupted in the middle by an intron of 101 bp. The promoter has features characteristic of a housekeeping gene. The GC content is high (80%) and distinct TATA and CCAAT motifs are lacking.\nMost cases appear to be due to three mutations. A transversion (T → G) mutation is the most common among adults with this disorder. This mutation interrupts a site of RNA splicing.\nThe gene encodes a protein—acid alpha-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.20)—which is a lysosomal hydrolase. The protein is an enzyme that normally degrades the alpha -1,4 and alpha -1,6 linkages in glycogen, maltose and isomaltose and is required for the degradation of 1–3% of cellular glycogen. The deficiency of this enzyme results in the accumulation of structurally normal glycogen in lysosomes and cytoplasm in affected individuals. Excessive glycogen storage within lysosomes may interrupt the normal functioning of other organelles and lead to cellular injury.\nA putative homologue—acid alpha-glucosidase-related gene 1—has been identified in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.",
    "Diagnosis": "In the early-onset form, an infant will present with poor feeding causing failure to thrive, or with difficulty breathing. The usual initial investigations include chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, and echocardiography. Typical findings are those of an enlarged heart with non-specific conduction defects. Biochemical investigations include serum creatine kinase (typically increased 10 fold) with lesser elevations of the serum aldolase, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase and lactic dehydrogenase. Diagnosis is made by estimating the acid alpha-glucosidase activity in either skin biopsy (fibroblasts), muscle biopsy (muscle cells), or white blood cells. The choice of sample depends on the facilities available at the diagnostic laboratory.[citation needed]\nIn the late-onset form, an adult will present with gradually progressive arm and leg weakness, with worsening respiratory function. Electromyography may be used initially to distinguish Pompe from other causes of limb weakness. The findings on biochemical tests are similar to those of the infantile form, with the caveat that the creatine kinase may be normal in some cases. The diagnosis is by estimation of the enzyme activity in a suitable sample.[citation needed]\nOn May 17, 2013, the Secretary's Discretionary Advisory Committee on Heritable Diseases in Newborns and Children (DACHDNC) approved a recommendation to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to add Pompe to the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP).[5] The HHS secretary must first approve the recommendation before the disease is formally added to the panel.\nThere are exceptions, but levels of alpha-glucosidase determine the type of GSD-II an individual may have. More alpha-glucosidase present in the individual's muscles means symptoms occur later in life and progress more slowly. GSD-II is broadly divided into two onset forms based on the age symptoms occur.[6]\nThe infantile-onset form is usually diagnosed at 4–8 months; muscles appear normal but are limp and weak preventing the child from lifting their head or rolling over. As the disease progresses, heart muscles thicken and progressively fail. Without treatment, death usually occurs due to heart failure and respiratory weakness.[6]\nThe late or later onset form occurs later than one to two years and progresses more slowly than the Infantile-onset form. One of the first symptoms is a progressive decrease in muscle strength starting with the legs and moving to smaller muscles in the trunk and arms, such as the diaphragm and other muscles required for breathing. Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death. Enlargement of the heart muscles and rhythm disturbances are not significant features but occur in some cases.[6]",
    "Treatment": "Cardiac and respiratory complications are treated symptomatically.[medical citation needed] Physical and occupational therapy may be beneficial for some patients.[medical citation needed] Alterations in diet may provide temporary improvement but will not alter the course of the disease.[medical citation needed] Genetic counseling can provide families with information regarding risk in future pregnancies.[medical citation needed]\nOn April 28, 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a biologic license application (BLA) for alglucosidase alfa, rhGAA (Myozyme),[7][8] the first treatment for patients with Pompe disease, developed by a team of Duke University researchers. This was based on enzyme replacement therapy using biologically active recombinant human alglucosidase alfa produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. Myozyme falls under the FDA orphan drug designation and was approved under a priority review.[citation needed]\nThe FDA approved Myozyme for administration by intravenous infusion of the solution.[9] The safety and efficacy of Myozyme were assessed in two separate clinical trials in 39 infantile-onset patients with Pompe disease ranging in age from 1 month to 3.5 years at the time of the first infusion.[9] Myozyme treatment prolongs ventilator-free survival and overall survival. Early diagnosis and early treatment lead to much better outcomes. The treatment is not without side effects which include fever, flushing, skin rash, increased heart rate, and even shock; these conditions, however, are usually manageable.[citation needed]\nMyozyme costs an average of US$300,000 a year and must be taken for the patient's entire life, so some American health insurers have refused to pay for it.[10] In August 2006, Health Canada approved Myozyme for the treatment of Pompe disease. In June 2007, the Canadian Common Drug Review issued its recommendations regarding public funding for Myozyme therapy. Their recommendation was to provide funding to treat a tiny subset of Pompe patients (Infants less one year of age with cardiomyopathy).[11]\nIn May 2010, the FDA approved Lumizyme for the treatment of late-onset Pompe disease.[12] Lumizyme and Myozyme have the same generic ingredient (alglucosidase alfa) and manufacturer (Genzyme Corporation).[9] The difference between these two products is in the manufacturing process.[9] Myozyme is made using a 160-L bioreactor, while Lumizyme uses a 4000-L bioreactor.[medical citation needed] Because of the difference in the manufacturing process, the FDA claims that the two products are biologically different.[medical citation needed] Myozyme is FDA approved for replacement therapy for infantile-onset Pompe disease.[9]\nIn July 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended the authorization of avalglucosidase alfa.[13] Avalglucosidase alfa (Nexviazyme) was approved for medical use in the United States in August 2021,[14][15] and in the European Union in June 2022.[16]\nIn December 2022, the EMA recommended the authorization of cipaglucosidase alfa. The approval was given in June 2023. In the EU, the therapy is available to all age groups without restrictions on weight of patients.[17][18][19]\nIn September 2023, the FDA  approved a two-component therapy of Pombiliti (cipaglucosidase alfa-atga) and Opfolda (miglustat) 65 mg capsules for adults living with late-onset Pompe disease weighing more than 40 kg and who are not improving on their current enzyme replacement therapy.[20][21]",
    "Prognosis": "The prognosis for individuals with Pompe disease varies according to the onset and severity of symptoms, along with lifestyle factors. Without treatment the infantile form (which can typically be predicted by mutation analysis) of the disease is particularly lethal — in these cases, the time taken to begin treatment is critical, with evidence that days (not weeks or months) matter.[22][23]\nMyozyme (alglucosidase alfa) is a recombinant form of the human enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase, and is also currently being used to replace the missing enzyme. In a study[24] which included the largest cohort of patients with Pompe disease treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) to date findings showed that Myozyme treatment clearly prolongs ventilator-free survival and overall survival in patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease as compared to an untreated historical control population. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that initiation of ERT before six months of age, which could be facilitated by newborn screening, shows great promise to reduce the mortality and disability associated with this devastating disorder. Taiwan and several states in the United States have started newborn screening and results of such regimens in early diagnosis and early initiation of the therapy have dramatically improved the outcome of the disease; many of these babies have reached normal motor developmental milestones.[25]\nAnother factor affecting the treatment response is the generation of antibodies against the infused enzyme, which is particularly severe in Pompe infants who have a complete deficiency of the acid alpha-glucosidase.[26] Immune tolerance therapy to eliminate these antibodies has improved the treatment outcome.[27]\nA Late Onset Treatment Study (LOTS) was published in 2010.[28] The study was undertaken to evaluate the safety and efficacy of aglucosidase alfa in juvenile and adult patients with Pompe disease. LOTS was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that enrolled 90 patients at eight primary sites in the United States and Europe. Participants received either aglucosidase alfa or a placebo every other week for 18 months. The average age of study participants was 44 years. The primary efficacy endpoints of the study sought to determine the effect of Myozyme on functional endurance as measured by the six-minute walk test and to determine the effect of aglucosidase alfa on pulmonary function as measured by percent predicted forced vital capacity.\nThe results showed that, at 78 weeks, patients treated with aglucosidase alfa increased their distance walked in six minutes by an average of approximately 25 meters as compared with the placebo group which declined by 3 meters (P=0.03). The placebo group did not show any improvement from baseline. The average baseline distance walked in six minutes in both groups was approximately 325 meters.\nPercent predicted forced vital capacity in the group of patients treated with aglucosidase alfa increased by 1.2 percent at 78 weeks. In contrast, it declined by approximately 2.2 percent in the placebo group (P=0.006).\nThere is an emerging recognition of the role that diet and exercise can play in functionally limiting symptom progression. This is an area for further study, as there is no clear consensus guideline, but rather a body of case study work that suggests that appropriate physical activity can be an effective tool in managing disease progression. In one such study, side-alternating vibration training was used 3 times weekly for 15 weeks. The results showed that, at 15 weeks, the patient had a 116-meter (70%) improvement to their 6MWT, which is significant compared with the results from the aforementioned LOTS study.[29]",

    "Signs and symptoms": "There is a relatively broad spectrum of clinical signs and symptoms that can occur in, ranging from complete absence of sexual development to partial completion of puberty that does not subsequently progress. Of note, the X-linked form of Kallmann syndrome (KS) form of GnRH insensitivity relating to mutations in the ANOS1 gene has the most consistent severe phenotypic presentation (i.e., prepubertal testes size and complete absence of gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH]-induced luteinizing hormone [LH] pulsations during frequency sampling studies) of all of the genes associated with this condition.[1][2]\nGnRH insensitivity can present at any age, but the presenting signs and symptoms are a function of the age-related period of reproductive activity.[citation needed]\nDuring the neonatal period, boys with the more severe cases of GnRH insensitivity can present with microphallus and/or cryptorchidism, presumably due to in utero and/or neonatal GnRH deficiency; approximately one-half of boys with microphallus have GnRH insensitivity as the underlying diagnosis. In comparison, newborn girls with GnRH insensitivity have no obvious abnormal reproductive tract findings that might provide clues to the diagnosis. However, in both sexes, other congenital nonreproductive features may be present (e.g., midline facial defects, skeletal abnormalities).[citation needed]\nDuring childhood, since the hypothalamic GnRH-pituitary-gonadal axis is quiescent, a diagnosis of GnRH insensitivity can generally be heralded only in the presence of nonreproductive phenotypes (e.g., the lack of sense of smell in some patients [anosmia] or skeletal abnormalities, such as cleft lip/cleft palate, hearing deficits, or syndactyly).[citation needed]\nAt puberty, patients of both sexes can present with a complete form of GnRH insensitivity that is characterized by a failure to initiate sexual maturation (e.g., lack of secondary sexual characteristics, primary amenorrhea in girls, lack of virilization in boys) and failure to establish a pubertal growth spurt.[citation needed]\nSome patients present with partial forms of GnRH insensitivity and undergo some degree of pubertal development that subsequently ceases. For example, some males with GnRH insensitivity exhibit some testicular growth, while some females can have thelarche and menarche, but hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) is demonstrable soon thereafter. Extremely rarely, a few have completely normal pubertal development and adulthood gonadal function, only to develop HH with prepubertal levels of testosterone but sometimes with normal testicular size as a clue to its acquired status, i.e., developing only after adult testicular development has been complete subsequently in adulthood, leading to infertility and sexual dysfunction.[3] These patients are referred to as having the adult-onset or acquired form of GnRH insensitivity.[citation needed]",
    "Causes": "Congenital Causes\nAcquired Causes",
    "Diagnosis": "When suspected on the basis of the clinical presentation or physical findings, the diagnosis of GnRH insensitivity should be confirmed biochemically. The diagnosis requires the following findings:[citation needed]\nApproach to genetic testing — When the diagnosis of GnRH insensitivity is suspected, it is suggested that referral to a clinical geneticist for further evaluation and possible genetic testing be done. As many of the genes causing GnRH insensitivity have pleotropic physiologic functions, genetic testing can aid assessment of both reproductive and nonreproductive clinical features. In addition, ascertaining the specific inheritance modes can aid genetic screening within the family to predict recurrence risk in siblings, family members or offspring of GnRH insensitivity patients. However, genetic testing in GnRH insensitivity is challenging, given the genetic and allelic heterogeneity, as well as complex oligogenic inheritance patterns. However, in the presence of either clear Mendelian inheritance patterns or specific phenotypic cues, targeted genetic testing or multigene panel testing may be performed. However, if such testing is done, variant interpretation and genetic counseling should be performed in conjunction with a clinical genetics service. Alternatively, several research units have special interests in the genetics of GnRH insensitivity, and clinicians can consider referring these patients to such specialized centers. Genetic testing is now commercially available through several Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) laboratories in the United States (GeneDx, Athena Diagnostics, Fulgent Diagnostics).[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "The choice of therapy for GnRH insensitivity depends upon the patient's age and desire to achieve one or more of the following goals:[citation needed]\nPuberty induction and sexual maturation\nGirls and women — Exogenous estrogens are used to start secondary sexual development in prepubertal girls and to build and sustain normal bone and muscle mass. Initiation of treatment are based upon the patient's bone age, current height percentiles, psychosexual needs, and predicted adult height. The shorter the predicted adult height, the later puberty should be induced. Inappropriate use of estrogens may result in rapid osseous maturation with resulting short stature and irregular menstrual bleeding.[citation needed]\nInitiation of puberty can begin with any type or route of exogenous estrogen, oral or transdermal. Initiation of puberty with transdermal 17-beta estradiol, starting with low doses of approximately 0.08 to 0.12 mcg estradiol per kg/day body weight, is successful and commonly prescribed by pediatricians.[6] The dose is then gradually increased over several years. Initial therapy consist of unopposed estrogen alone to maximize breast growth, achieve appropriate skeletal maturation, and to induce uterine and endometrial proliferation. A progestin eventually needs to be added to prevent endometrial hyperplasia, but adding it prematurely or administering combinations of estrogens and progestins (e.g., birth control pills) before completion of breast development should be avoided because it is likely to reduce ultimate breast size.[citation needed]\nOnce pubertal induction is completed, estrogen and progestin therapy are continued indefinitely. Doses and principles of therapy are similar to those for women with primary ovarian insufficiency.[citation needed]\nBoys and men — In boys, puberty can be induced with testosterone, exogenous gonadotropins, or pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) therapy. The latter two options also induce spermatogenesis, which is not necessary for this age group. Testosterone therapy is suggested for pubertal induction in boys. The goals of therapy are to:[citation needed]\nOral testosterone preparations should not be used, because of hepatic toxicity. The choices for testosterone replacement include intramuscular injections of long-acting testosterone preparations or topical gels/solutions/patches. Serum testosterone levels should be monitored and dose adjusted.[citation needed]\nWhichever form of testosterone replacement is chosen, providing psychological support is important because the patient will have a variety of new and often confusing symptoms, much like an adolescent undergoing puberty but more difficult because it will likely be at a later age. Testosterone therapy should be initiated at a low dose and gradually increased to an adult dose over a few years.[citation needed]\nOnce pubertal induction is completed, testosterone therapy is continued indefinitely.[citation needed]",
    "Prognosis": "The prognosis is generally good, with the outcome for fertility depending on the severity of the sex hormone deficiency and the age of initiation of treatment. Rare cases of complete resolution have been described but the pathophysiology of the disease in these patients is not understood.[citation needed]",
    "Epidemiology": "Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) insensitivity affects both sexes but has a significant male preponderance. A population-based, epidemiological study from Finland showed a minimal prevalence estimate of the Kallman syndrome (KS) form of Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) insensitivity to be 1:48,000 with a clear difference between males (1:30,000) and females (1:125,000).[5]"

    "Disease": "Gorham%27s disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The symptoms of Gorham's disease vary depending on the bones involved. It may affect any part of the skeleton, but the most common sites of disease are the shoulder, skull, pelvic girdle, jaw, ribs, and spine.[4][5][6][7]\nIn some cases, no symptoms are seen until a fracture occurs either spontaneously or following minor trauma, such as a fall. An acute onset of localized pain and swelling may occur. More commonly, pain of no apparent cause increases in frequency and intensity over time and may eventually be accompanied by weakness and noticeable deformity of the area. The rate of progression is unpredictable, and the prognosis can be difficult. The disease may stabilize after a number of years, go into spontaneous remission, or in cases involving the chest and upper spine, prove fatal. Recurrence of the disease following remission can also occur. Involvement of the spine and skull base may cause a poor outcome from neurological complications. In many cases, the result of Gorham's disease is severe deformity and functional disability.[4][5][8]\nSymptoms such as difficulty breathing and chest pain may be present if the disease is present in the ribs, scapula, or thoracic vertebrae. These may indicate that the disease has spread from the bone into the chest cavity. The breathing problems may be misdiagnosed as asthma, because the damage done to the lungs can cause the same types of changes to lung function testing as seen in asthma.[6] Extension of the lesions into the chest may lead to the development of chylous pleural and pericardial effusions. Chyle is rich in protein and white blood cells that are important in fighting infection. The loss of chyle into the chest can have serious consequences, including infection, malnutrition, and respiratory distress and failure. These complications or their symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, poor growth or weight loss, and infection have sometimes been the first indications of the condition.[6][7][8]",
    "Causes": "The specific cause of Gorham's disease remains unknown. Bone mass and strength are obtained and maintained through a lifelong process of bone destruction and replacement that occurs at the cellular level. Cells called osteoclasts secrete enzymes that dissolve old bone, allowing another type of cells called osteoblasts to form new bone. Except in growing bone, the rate of breakdown equals the rate of building, thereby maintaining bone mass. In Gorham's disease, that process is disrupted.[2][3][4][9][10][11]\nGorham and Stout found that vascular anomalies always occupied space that normally would be filled with new bone and speculated that the presence of angiomatosis may lead to chemical changes in the bone.[2][9] Gorham and others speculated that such a change in the bone chemistry might cause an imbalance in the rate of osteoclast to osteoblast activity such that more bone is dissolved than is replaced.[9] Beginning in the 1990s, elevated levels of a protein called interleukin-6 (IL-6) being detected in people with the disease were reported, leading some to suggest that increased levels of IL-6 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) may contribute to the chemical changes Gorham and others believed were the cause of this type of osteolysis.[4][12]\nIn 1999, Möller and colleagues[4] concluded, \"The Gorham-Stout syndrome may be, essentially, a monocentric bone disease with a focally increased bone resorption due to an increased number of paracrine – or autocrine – stimulated hyperactive osteoclasts. The resorbed bone is replaced by a markedly vascularized  fibrous tissue. The apparent contradiction concerning the presence or absence or the number of osteoclasts, may be explained by the different phases of the syndrome.\" They further stated that their histopathological study provided good evidence that osteolytic changes seen in Gorham's disease are the result of hyperactive osteoclastic bone. However, others have concluded that lymphangiomatosis and Gorham's disease should be considered as a spectrum of disease rather than separate diseases.[13]\nWhile a consensus exists that Gorham's is caused by deranged osteoclastic activity,[2][4][9][11] no conclusive evidence has been found as to what causes this behavior to begin.",
    "Diagnosis": "In 1983, Heffez and colleagues[10] published a case report in which they suggested eight criteria for a definitive diagnosis of Gorham's disease:[citation needed]\nIn the early stages of the disease, X-rays reveal changes resembling patchy osteoporosis. As the disease progresses, bone deformity occurs with further loss of bone mass, and in the tubular bones (the long bones of the arms and legs), a concentric shrinkage is often seen which has been described as having a \"sucked candy\" appearance. Once the cortex (the outer shell) of the bone has been disrupted, vascular channels may invade adjacent soft tissues and joints. Eventually, complete or near-complete resorption of the bone occurs and may extend to adjacent bones, though spontaneous arrest of bone loss has been reported on occasion. Throughout this process, as the bone is destroyed, it is replaced by angiomatous and/or fibrous tissue.[2][3][4][11][14]\nOften, Gorham's disease is not recognized until a fracture occurs, with subsequent improper bone healing. The diagnosis is essentially one of exclusion and must be based on combined clinical, radiological, and histopathological findings.[4] X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, ultrasounds, and nuclear medicine (bone scans) are all important tools in the diagnostic workup and surgical planning, but none has the ability alone to produce a definitive diagnosis. Surgical biopsy with histological identification of the vascular or lymphatic proliferation within a generous section of the affected bone is an essential component in the diagnostic process.[4][5][8]\nRecognition of the disease requires a high index of suspicion and an extensive workup. Because of its serious morbidity, Gorham's must always be considered in the differential diagnosis of osteolytic lesions.[3]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment of Gorham's disease is for the most part palliative and limited to symptom management.[citation needed]\nSometimes, the bone destruction spontaneously ceases and no treatment is required, but when the disease is progressive, aggressive intervention may be necessary. Duffy and colleagues[6] reported that around 17% of people with Gorham's disease in the ribs, shoulder, or upper spine experience extension of the disease into the chest, leading to chylothorax with its serious consequences, and that the mortality rate in this group can reach as high as 64% without surgical intervention.\nA search of the medical literature reveals multiple case reports of interventions with varying rates of success as follows:[citation needed]\nCardiothoracic (heart and lung):\nSkeletal:",
    "Epidemiology": "Gorham's disease is extremely rare and may occur at any age, though it is most often recognized in children and young adults. It strikes males and females of all races and exhibits no inheritance pattern. The medical literature contains case reports from every continent. Because it is so rare, and commonly misdiagnosed,  exactly how many people are affected by this disease is not known. The literature frequently cites that fewer than 200 cases have been reported, though a consensus is building that many more cases occur around the world than have been reported.[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "Granuloma annulare",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Aside from the visible rash, granuloma annulare is usually asymptomatic. Sometimes the rash may burn or itch. People with GA usually notice a ring of small, firm bumps (papules) more commonly over the backs of the forearms, hands or feet, often centered on joints or knuckles. GA, however, can be anywhere on the body and has also been seen on necks, backs, ankles and wrists. Bumps are caused by the clustering of T cells below the skin. These papules start as very small, pimple looking bumps, which spread over time from that size to dime, quarter, half-dollar size and beyond. Occasionally, multiple rings may join into one. Rarely, GA may appear as a firm nodule under the skin of the arms or legs.  It also occurs on the sides and circumferential at the waist and without therapy can continue to be present for many years. Outbreaks continue to develop at the edges of the aging rings.[citation needed]",
    "Causes": "The condition is usually seen in otherwise healthy people. Occasionally, it may be associated with diabetes or thyroid disease. It has also been associated with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Lyme disease and Addison's disease. At this time, no conclusive connection has been made between patients.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "Granuloma annulare may be divided into the following types:[14]: 703–5",
    "Treatment": "Because granuloma annulare is usually asymptomatic and self-limiting with a course of about two years, initial treatment is generally topical steroids or calcineurin inhibitors; if unimproved with topical treatments, it may be treated with intradermal injections of steroids or phototherapy. If local treatment fails it may be treated with systemic corticosteroids.[15][16] Treatment success varies widely, with most patients finding only brief success with the above-mentioned treatments. Most lesions of granuloma annulare disappear in pre-pubertal patients with no treatment within two years while older patients (50+) have rings for upwards of 20 years. The appearance of new rings years later is not uncommon.[17]"

    "Disease": "Granulomatosis with polyangiitis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Initial signs are highly variable, and diagnosis can be severely delayed due to the nonspecific nature of the symptoms. In general, irritation and nasal inflammation are the first signs in most people.[12][13] Involvement of the upper respiratory tract, such as the nose and sinuses, is seen in nearly all people with GPA.[14][15] Typical signs and symptoms of nose or sinus involvement include crusting around the nose, stuffiness, nosebleeds, runny nose, and \"saddle-nose\" deformity due to a hole in the septum of the nose.[7][14] Inflammation of the outer layers of the eye (scleritis and episcleritis[16][17]) and conjunctivitis are the most common signs of GPA in the eye; involvement of the eyes is common and occurs in slightly more than half of people with the disease.[6]",
    "Causes": "The cause of GPA is unknown, although microbes, such as bacteria and viruses, as well as genetics, have been implicated in its pathogenesis.[13][19]",
    "Diagnosis": "Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is usually suspected only when a person has had unexplained symptoms for a long period. The determination of ANCAs can aid in diagnosing GPA, but positivity is not conclusive, and negative ANCAs are insufficient to reject the diagnosis. More than 90% of people who have GPA test positive for ANCAs.[20] Cytoplasmic-staining ANCAs that react with the enzyme proteinase 3 (cANCA) in neutrophils (a type of white blood cells) are associated with GPA.[12] Involvement of the ears, nose, and throat is more common in granulomatosis with polyangiitis than in the similar condition microscopic polyangiitis.[7]\nIf the person has signs of kidney involvement or cutaneous vasculitis, a biopsy is obtained from the kidneys. Rarely, a thoracoscopic lung biopsy is required. On histopathological examination, a biopsy will show leukocytoclastic vasculitis with necrotic changes and granulomatous inflammation (clumps of typically arranged white blood cells) on microscopy. These granulomas are the main reason for the name granulomatosis with polyangiitis, although they are not an essential feature. Nevertheless, necrotizing granulomas are a hallmark of this disease. Many biopsies can be nonspecific, though, and 50% provide too little information for the diagnosis of GPA.[12]\nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis is part of a larger group of vasculitic syndromes called systemic vasculitides or necrotizing vasculopathies, all of which feature an autoimmune attack by an abnormal type of circulating antibody termed ANCAs (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) against small and medium-sized blood vessels. Apart from GPA, this category includes eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) and microscopic polyangiitis.[1] Although GPA affects small- and medium-sized vessels,[21] it is formally classified as one of the small-vessel vasculitides in the Chapel Hill system.[2]\nIn 1990, the American College of Rheumatology accepted classification criteria for GPA. These criteria were not intended for diagnosis but for inclusion in randomized controlled trials. Two or more positive criteria have a sensitivity of 88.2% and a specificity of 92.0% of describing GPA.[14][22]\nAccording to the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC) on the nomenclature of systemic vasculitis (1992), establishing the diagnosis of GPA demands[23]\na granulomatous inflammation involving the respiratory tract, and a vasculitis of small to medium-sized vessels.\nSeveral investigators have compared the ACR and Chapel Hill criteria.[24]\nIn 2022, the American College of Rheumatology and the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology updated the classification criteria for GPA.[25]",
    "Treatment": "GPA treatment depends on its severity and whether it has caused organ damage.[8]\nThe standard treatment for severe GPA is to induce remission with immunosuppressants such as rituximab or cyclophosphamide in combination with high-dose corticosteroids.[8][26] Plasmapheresis is sometimes recommended for very severe manifestations of GPA, such as diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (as seen in pulmonary-renal syndrome).[5][9] The use of plasmapheresis in those with GPA and acute kidney failure (renal vasculitis) might reduce progression to end-stage kidney disease at three months.[9]\nOral and intravenous cyclophosphamide are both effective for the induction of GPA remission. Oral cyclophosphamide at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day was the standard treatment for many years; this regimen resulted in complete remission in more than 75% of people with GPA but is associated with significant toxicities, including infertility, inflammation and bleeding from the bladder, and bladder cancer.[8] In contrast, administering pulsed doses of intravenous cyclophosphamide is equally effective for inducing remission, results in a lower cumulative dose, and decreases the incidence of abnormally low white blood cell counts by one-third.[8] However, pulsed intravenous cyclophosphamide may be associated with a higher risk of GPA relapse when compared to oral cyclophosphamide.[8] Due to a high frequency of abnormally low white blood cell counts seen with cyclophosphamide treatment, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia is a common complication, so prophylaxis against this pathogen is recommended.[8]\nRituximab may be substituted for cyclophosphamide to induce remission since it is similarly effective and has a comparable side-effect profile.[26][27] The dose of corticosteroids is generally tapered (decreased) very slowly over several months to reduce the risk of another GPA flare. After a person with GPA has successfully undergone induction and gone into remission, the treatment goal then shifts to maintaining remission and preventing subsequent GPA flares. Less-toxic immunosuppressing medications such as rituximab, methotrexate, azathioprine, leflunomide, or mycophenolate mofetil are used.[28] TNF inhibitors, such as etanercept, appear to be ineffective and are not recommended for routine use.[8]\nIn generalized non-organ-threatening disease, remission can be achieved with a combination of methotrexate and corticosteroids, where the steroid dose is reduced after a remission has been achieved and methotrexate is used as maintenance therapy. Treatment measures for localised GPA of the nose and sinuses include nasal irrigation, nasal corticosteroids, and antibiotics if infection occurs.[14] If perforation of the nasal septum occurs (or saddle-nose deformity), then surgical repair is recommended.[14]\nTrimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole has been proposed to help prevent relapse, though a 2015 Cochrane review did not confirm fewer relapses with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole treatment.[8][9]",
    "Prognosis": "Before modern treatments, the two-year survival was under 10%. The average survival was five months.[13][29] Death usually resulted from uremia or respiratory failure.[13] The revised five-factor score is associated with five-year mortality from GPA and is based on these criteria: Age greater than 65 years, cardiac symptoms, gastrointestinal involvement, chronic kidney disease, and the absence of ear, nose, and throat symptoms.[7]\nWith corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide, five-year survival is over 80%.[13] Long-term complications are common (86%), mainly chronic kidney failure, hearing loss, and deafness.[12] The risk of relapse is increased in people with GPA who test positive for anti-PR3 ANCA antibodies and is higher than the relapse risk for microscopic polyangiitis.[7]\nToday, medication toxicity is managed more carefully, and long-term remissions are possible. Some affected people can lead relatively normal lives and remain in remission for 20+ years after treatment.[30]",
    "Epidemiology": "The incidence is 10–20 cases per million per year.[31][32] It is exceedingly rare in Japan and among African Americans.[32]"

    "Disease": "Gunther disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Though expressivity is varied depending on the mutation responsible for decrease in enzyme function, severe cutaneous sensitivity is present in most cases of this Porphyria. An estimated 30–40% of cases are due to the C73R mutation, which decreases stability of the enzyme and results in <1% of its activity.[9] Exposure to long-wave ultraviolet light causes the affected skin to thicken and produce vesicles that are prone to rupture and infection; these secondary infections, along with bone resorption, can lead to disfigurement of the sun-exposed face and extremities.[10]\nEnzyme dysfunction prevents the normal production of heme and hemolytic anemia is another common symptom, though a lack of hemolysis in this disease is possible. Porphyrins additionally accumulate in the bone and teeth, resulting in erythrodontia.[10][11]\nWhen unexpected attacks occur, abdominal pain, as well as vomiting and constipation commonly follow the attacks. Exposure to the sunlight can cause discomfort and result in blistering, consciousness of heat, and swelling and redness of the skin.[12]\nPhotomutilation and transfusion-dependent anemia are common complications.[10][13] Liver disease is also observed in some cases.[10] It has been reported that early childhood-onset haematological manifestations is a poor prognosis factor.[13]",
    "Causes": "Gunther disease is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes the enzyme uroporphyrinogen III synthase (UROS), located at human chromosome 10q25.2-q26.3.[4][14] The disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.[4] This means the defective gene is responsible for the disorder and is located on an autosome, and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder. When there is a homozygous mutation it causes a uroporphyrinogen III synthase and uroporphyrinogen cosynthase defect. When the enzyme uroporphyrinogen III synthase is reacting normally it results in the making of isomer III porphyrinogen, which is what is used to form heme. When isomer III porphyrinogen is not produced because of a poor production of uroporphyrinogen III synthase then isomer I porphyrinogen is made which will oxidize and give a reddish tint skin.[15][16]",
    "Diagnosis": "When diagnosing Congenital Erythroipoetic Porphyria (Gunther Disease) one must exclude other forms of porphyria. These include Hepatoerythropoietic Porphyria and rare homozygous variants of Variegate Porphyria, Hereditary Coproporphyria, and STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in Infancy (SAVI). Mild variants may be present similarly to Porphyria Cutanea Tarda. [citation needed]\nThere are four steps in establishing the diagnosis of any porphyria. First, a thorough history (particularly family history) and physical exam are performed with special attention paid to sun-exposed skin. Biochemical measurements of porphyrins and precursors in the urine, feces, and blood are necessary. Specialized labs are helpful in measuring activity of specific enzymes of the heme synthesis pathway and/or DNA and mutational analyses. In CEP, activity of uroporphyrinogen III synthase (the fourth enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway) will be markedly decreased. [citation needed]\nIn congenital erythropoietic porphyria, urine aminolavulanic acid and porphobilinogen are typically normal. However, uroporphyrin and coproporphyrin tend to be markedly elevated and moderately elevated, respectively, in the urine more than in the feces. Additionally, fecal protoporphyrin is typically mildly elevated.[citation needed]\nIn the red blood cells, uroporphyrin, coproporphyrin and protoporphyrin are all elevated, distinguishing this form of porphyria from the others. Finally, plasma analysis will demonstrate elevated uroporphyrin and coproporphyrin. [citation needed]\nOther nonspecific but helpful diagnostic clues are history of cutaneous photosensitivity, blistering, erosions, crusts and ulcerations leading to extensive scarring and deformation of the hands, loss of eyebrows, eyelashes with severe mutilation of cartilaginous structures like the nose, erythrodontia, and variable degree of hematologic involvement ranging from mild hemolytic anemia to intrauterine hydrops fetalis. Other early clues are red or violet staining of diapers.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "There are multiple ways to treat Gunther's diseases, but one of the most crucial things that a person with this disease can do is limit themselves from sun exposure or eliminate sun exposure altogether. There are some sunscreens that have undesirable effects such as tropical sunscreens, but other sunscreens containing zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are shown to provide protection due to those light-reflective agents. To block the ultraviolet and visible light wavelengths and get the protection that patients with Gunther's disease require, physical barriers are needed. It is also advised that patients wear protective clothing to block the sun from their skin. Plastic films can be attached to car windows and homes to filter out some of the wavelengths that could cause harm to someone's skin with this disease. Incandescent bulbs replace the normal fluorescent lamps. These bulbs release less light, which prevents the \"porphyrin-exciting\" wavelengths that fluorescent lights emit.[17]\nOther less beneficial treatments have been used to help treat Gunther's disease. These include oral beta-carotene and other treatments such as activated charcoal and cholestyramine, which are used to interrupt and stop the porphyrins from being reabsorbed in the body. The reason that these oral treatments are unreasonable is because they require an extremely large dose of medicine and therefore are not beneficial.[17]\nErythrocyte transfusions have been shown to be a successful measure in decreasing the appearance of the disease by trying to lower the erythropoiesis and circulating porphyrin levels. Unfortunately, having chronic erythrocyte transfusions can be extremely harmful to the body and can cause severe complications.[17]\nTo help with dry eye symptoms and visual function, topical lubrication can be used.\nA more invasive way to help treat Gunther's disease would be to have surgery. There have been numerous studies that have stated that bone marrow transplantation is successful.[18] This is a recently new development for Gunther's disease so the long-term effects are still unresourced. If a patient has a life-threatening infectious complication then bone marrow transplantation is no longer relevant for them.\nThere are also reports that stem cell transplantation is successful in a limited number of participants[17]"

  {
    "Disease": "Haemophilia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Characteristic symptoms vary with severity. In general symptoms are internal or external bleeding episodes, which are called \"bleeds\".[18][19] People with more severe haemophilia experience more severe and more frequent bleeds, while people with mild haemophilia usually experience more minor symptoms except after surgery or serious trauma. In cases of moderate haemophilia symptoms are variable which manifest along a spectrum between severe and mild forms.[20]\nIn both haemophilia A and B, there is spontaneous bleeding but a normal bleeding time, normal prothrombin time, normal thrombin time, but prolonged partial thromboplastin time. Internal bleeding is common in people with severe haemophilia and some individuals with moderate haemophilia. The most characteristic type of internal bleed is a joint bleed where blood enters into the joint spaces.[21] This is most common with severe haemophiliacs and can occur spontaneously (without evident trauma). If not treated promptly, joint bleeds can lead to permanent joint damage and disfigurement.[21] Bleeding into soft tissues such as muscles and subcutaneous tissues is less severe but can lead to damage and requires treatment.[22]\nChildren with mild to moderate haemophilia may not have any signs or symptoms at birth, especially if they do not undergo circumcision. Their first symptoms are often frequent and large bruises and haematomas from frequent bumps and falls as they learn to walk. Swelling and bruising from bleeding in the joints, soft tissue, and muscles may also occur. Children with mild haemophilia may not have noticeable symptoms for many years. Often, the first sign in very mild haemophiliacs is heavy bleeding from a dental procedure, an accident, or surgery. Females who are carriers usually have enough clotting factors from their one normal gene to prevent serious bleeding problems, though some may present as mild haemophiliacs.[23]\nSevere complications are much more common in cases of severe and moderate haemophilia. Complications may arise from the disease itself or from its treatment:[24]\nHaemophilic arthropathy is characterised by chronic proliferative synovitis and cartilage destruction.[25] If an intra-articular bleed is not drained early, it may cause apoptosis of chondrocytes and affect the synthesis of proteoglycans. The hypertrophied and fragile synovial lining while attempting to eliminate excessive blood may be more likely to easily rebleed, leading to a vicious cycle of hemarthrosis-synovitis-hemarthrosis.  In addition, iron deposition in the synovium may induce an inflammatory response activating the immune system and stimulating angiogenesis, resulting in  cartilage and bone destruction.[26]",
    "Diagnosis": "Haemophilia can be diagnosed before, during or after birth if there is a family history of the condition. Several options are available to parents. If there is no family history of haemophilia, it is usually only diagnosed when a child begins to walk or crawl. Affected children may experience joint bleeds or easy bruising.[36]\nMild haemophilia may only be discovered later, usually after an injury or a dental or surgical procedure.[37]\nGenetic testing and counselling are available to help determine the risk of passing the condition onto a child.[36] This may involve testing a sample of tissue or blood to look for signs of the genetic mutation that causes haemophilia.[36]\nA pregnant woman with a history of haemophilia in her family can test for the haemophilia gene. Such tests include:\nThere is a small risk of these procedures causing problems such as miscarriage or premature labour, so the woman may discuss this with the doctor in charge of her care.[36]\nIf haemophilia is suspected after a child has been born, a blood test can usually confirm the diagnosis. Blood from the umbilical cord can be tested at birth if there's a family history of haemophilia. A blood test will also be able to identify whether a child has haemophilia A or B, and how severe it is.[36]\nThere are several types of haemophilia: haemophilia A, haemophilia B, haemophilia C, parahaemophilia, acquired haemophilia A, and acquired haemophilia B.[40][41][42][43]\nHaemophilia A is a recessive X-linked genetic disorder resulting in a deficiency of functional clotting Factor VIII.[41] Haemophilia B is also a recessive X-linked genetic disorder involving a lack of functional clotting Factor IX.[44] Haemophilia C is an autosomal genetic disorder involving a lack of functional clotting Factor XI. Haemophilia C is not completely recessive, as heterozygous individuals also show increased bleeding.[42]\nThe type of haemophilia known as parahaemophilia is a mild and rare form and is due to a deficiency in factor V. This type can be inherited or acquired.[10]\nA non-genetic form of haemophilia is caused by autoantibodies against factor VIII and so is known as acquired haemophilia A.[15] It is a rare but potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder caused by the development of autoantibodies (inhibitors) directed against plasma coagulation factors.[45] Acquired haemophilia can be associated with cancers, autoimmune disorders and following childbirth.[14]",
    "Treatment": "There is no long-term cure. Treatment and prevention of bleeding episodes is done primarily by replacing the missing blood clotting factors.[3]\nClotting factors are usually not needed in mild haemophilia.[16] In moderate haemophilia clotting factors are typically only needed when bleeding occurs or to prevent bleeding with certain events.[16] In severe haemophilia preventive use is often recommended two or three times a week and may continue for life.[16] Rapid treatment of bleeding episodes decreases damage to the body.[16]\nFactor VIII is used in haemophilia A and factor IX in haemophilia B. Factor replacement can be either isolated from human plasma, recombinant, or a combination of the two. Some people develop antibodies (inhibitors) against the replacement factors given to them, so the amount of the factor has to be increased or non-human replacement products must be given, such as porcine factor VIII.[46]\nIf a person becomes refractory to replacement coagulation factor as a result of high levels of circulating inhibitors, this may be partially overcome with recombinant human factor VIII.[47]\nIn 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved an anti-haemophilic drug completely free of albumin, which made it the first anti-haemophilic drug in the US to use an entirely synthetic purification process.[48] Since 1993 recombinant factor products (which are typically cultured in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) tissue culture cells and involve little, if any human plasma products) have been available and have been widely used in wealthier western countries. While recombinant clotting factor products offer higher purity and safety, they are, like concentrate, extremely expensive, and not generally available in the developing world. In many cases, factor products of any sort are difficult to obtain in developing countries.[49]\nClotting factors are either given preventively or on-demand. Preventive use involves the infusion of clotting factor on a regular schedule in order to keep clotting levels sufficiently high to prevent spontaneous bleeding episodes. On-demand (or episodic) treatment involves treating bleeding episodes once they arise. In 2007, a trial comparing on-demand treatment of boys (< 30 months) with haemophilia A with prophylactic treatment (infusions of 25 IU/kg body weight of Factor VIII every other day) in respect to its effect on the prevention of joint-diseases. When the boys reached 6 years of age, 93% of those in the prophylaxis group and 55% of those in the episodic-therapy group had a normal index joint-structure on MRI.[50] Preventative treatment, however, resulted in average costs of $300,000 per year. The author of an editorial published in the same issue of the NEJM supports the idea that prophylactic treatment not only is more effective than on demand treatment but also suggests that starting after the first serious joint-related haemorrhage may be more cost effective than waiting until the fixed age to begin.[51] Most haemophiliacs in third world countries have limited or no access to commercial blood clotting factor products.[52]\nFitusiran (Qfitlia) was approved for medical use in the United States in March 2025.[53][54]\nDesmopressin (DDAVP) may be used in those with mild haemophilia A.[16] Tranexamic acid or epsilon aminocaproic acid may be given along with clotting factors to prevent breakdown of clots.[16]\nPain medicines, steroids, and physical therapy may be used to reduce pain and swelling in an affected joint.[16] In those with severe haemophilia A already receiving FVIII, emicizumab may provide some benefit.[55] Different treatments are used to help those with an acquired form of haemophilia in addition to the normal clotting factors. Often the most effective treatment is corticosteroids which remove the auto-antibodies in half of people. As a secondary route of treatment, cyclophosphamide and cyclosporine are used and are proven effective for those who did not respond to the steroid treatments. In rare cases a third route or treatment is used, high doses of intravenous immunoglobulin or immunosorbent that works to help control bleeding instead of battling the auto-antibodies.[56]\nAnticoagulants such as heparin and warfarin are contraindicated for people with haemophilia as these can aggravate clotting difficulties. Also contraindicated are those drugs which have \"blood thinning\" side effects. For instance, medicines which contain aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen sodium should not be taken because they are well known to have the side effect of prolonged bleeding.[57]\nAlso contraindicated are activities with a high likelihood of trauma, such as motorcycling and skateboarding. Popular sports with very high rates of physical contact and injuries such as American football, hockey, boxing, wrestling, and rugby should be avoided by people with haemophilia.[57][58] Other active sports like soccer, baseball, and basketball also have a high rate of injuries, but have overall less contact and should be undertaken cautiously and only in consultation with a doctor.[57]",
    "Prognosis": "Like most aspects of the disorder, life expectancy varies with severity and adequate treatment. People with severe haemophilia who do not receive adequate, modern treatment have greatly shortened lifespans and often do not reach maturity. Prior to the 1960s when effective treatment became available, average life expectancy was only 11 years.[21] By the 1980s the life span of the average haemophiliac receiving appropriate treatment was 50–60 years.[21] Today with appropriate treatment, males with haemophilia typically have a near normal quality of life with an average lifespan approximately 10 years shorter than an unaffected male.[59]\nSince the 1980s the primary leading cause of death of people with severe haemophilia has shifted from haemorrhage to HIV/AIDS acquired through treatment with contaminated blood products.[21] The second leading cause of death related to severe haemophilia complications is intracranial haemorrhage which today accounts for one third of all deaths of people with haemophilia. Two other major causes of death include hepatitis infections causing cirrhosis and obstruction of air or blood flow due to soft tissue haemorrhage.[21]",
    "Epidemiology": "Haemophilia frequency is about 1 instance in every 10,000 births (or 1 in 5,000 male births) for haemophilia A and 1 in 50,000 births for haemophilia B.[60] About 18,000 people in the United States have haemophilia. Each year in the US, about 400 babies are born with the disorder. Haemophilia usually occurs in males and less often in females.[61] It is estimated that about 2,500 Canadians have haemophilia A, and about 500 Canadians have haemophilia B.[62]"

    "Disease": "Hailey%E2%80%93Hailey disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "HHD is characterized by outbreaks of rashes and blisters on the skin. Affected areas of skin undergo repeated blistering and inflammation, and may be painful to the touch. Areas where the skin folds, as well as the armpits, groin, neck, buttocks and under the breasts are most commonly affected. In addition to blistering, other symptoms which accompany HHD include acantholysis, erythema and hyperkeratosis.[5] It typically begins in late teenage years or in a person's 30s or 40s. [6]",
    "Causes": "The cause of the disease is a haploinsufficiency of the enzyme ATP2C1;[7] the ATP2C1 gene is located on chromosome 3, which encodes the protein hSPCA1. A mutation on one copy of the gene causes only half of this necessary protein to be made and the cells of the skin do not adhere together properly due to malformation of intercellular desmosomes, causing acantholysis, blisters and rashes.  There is no known cure.[6]",
    "Diagnosis": "While the term pemphigus typically refers to \"a rare group of blistering autoimmune diseases\" affecting \"the skin and mucous membranes\",[8] Hailey–Hailey disease is not an autoimmune disorder and there are no autoantibodies.[9] According to Pemphigus Pemphigoid Foundation (IPPF), \"familial benign chronic pemphigus, or Hailey–Hailey disease, is a different condition from Pemphigus\".[10]\nThe differential diagnosis includes intertrigo, candidiasis, frictional or contact dermatitis, and inverse psoriasis.[11] A biopsy and/or family history can confirm.[12] The lack of oral lesions and intercellular antibodies distinguishes familial benign pemphigus from other forms of pemphigus.[13]",
    "Treatment": "Topical steroid preparations often help outbreaks; use of the weakest corticosteroid that is effective is recommended to help prevent thinning of the skin. Drugs such as antibiotics, antifungals, corticosteroids, dapsone, methotrexate, thalidomide, etretinate, cyclosporine and, most recently, intramuscular alefacept may control the disease but are ineffective for severe chronic or relapsing forms of the disease. Intracutaneous injections of botulinum toxin to inhibit perspiration may be of benefit.[14] Maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding heat and friction of affected areas, and keeping the area clean and dry may help prevent flares.[citation needed]\nSome have found relief in laser resurfacing that burns off the top layer of the epidermis, allowing healthy non-affected skin to regrow in its place.[citation needed] Secondary bacterial, fungal and/or viral infections are common and may exacerbate an outbreak. Some have found that outbreaks are triggered by certain foods, hormone cycles and stress.\nIn many cases naltrexone, taken daily in low doses, appears to help.[15][16]"

    "Disease": "Chronic multifocal Langerhans cell histiocytosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The traditional combination of three features are seen in 25% of people with the condition, which usually presents between the ages of two and six; one or both bulging eyes, breakdown of bone (lytic bone lesions often in the skull in a 'punched out' pattern), and diabetes insipidus (excessive thirst and passing urine).[2][5] The skin can be affected with rashes, bumps and ulcers, and bones can be painful. There may be large lymph nodes and signs of lung and liver disease. Affected people may present with fever and weight loss.[1]\nThe face may look asymmetrical and ear infections are common.[5] Between 5 and 75% of cases have been reported to present with signs in the mouth.[5] These include mouth ulcers, bad breath, swollen gums, loose teeth and an unpleasant taste.[5] Destruction of part of the jaw bone may give the appearance of advanced gum disease.[5]",
    "Causes": "The cause is a genetic mutation in the MAPKinase pathway that occurs during early development.[1]\nThe origin is a dendritic cell, although previously thought to be a histiocyte, a term still used. The mutations causes white blood cells (lymphocytes, macrophages, and eosinophils) to move towards dendritic cells, resulting in damage in any organ except the heart and kidneys.[1]\nThe disease was once thought to be a lipid storage disease as the lesions have a high cholesterol content, but the blood cholesterol is usually normal.[5][13]\nSome sources such as the National Cancer Institute describe it as a type of cancer,[14] while other sources specifically state it is not a type of cancer.[15]",
    "Diagnosis": "Tests usually include imaging using MRI.[6] Findings include breakdown of bone and thickening of the pituitary stalk. The perivascular space may appear prominent, the pituitary gland cystic and there may be signs in the white matter, a mass in the hypothalamus and enhancement of the meninges.[6]\nX-ray findings typically demonstrate sharp \"punched out\" lesions in the skull. The destruction of alveolar bone is usually more generalised and may appear as displaced teeth.[5]\nBlood tests may show anaemia, and less commonly a low white blood cell count and low platelet count.[5][13] Other useful tests might include a PET scan.[1] Diagnosis is confirmed by tissue biopsy.[6][7]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment may involve surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and certain medicines.[7]",
    "Prognosis": "The outlook depends on how many and how much organs are affected.[7] The prognosis is poor if the disease presents in a young person with many affected organs, unless a newborn with skin lesions only, when the outlook is better. The prognosis is poor if liver, spleen, lung, or bone marrow is affected.[7] A good response to chemotherapy within the first six weeks of treatment, has been found to indicate a better prognosis. In some people the condition is life-threatening.[7] Hence, follow-up is long-term.[7]",

    "Disease": "Harlequin syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The \"Harlequin sign\" is unilateral flushing and sweating of the face, neck, and upper chest usually after exposure to heat or strenuous exertion.[6] Horner syndrome, another problem associated with the sympathetic nervous system, is often seen in conjunction with harlequin syndrome.[citation needed]\nSince Harlequin syndrome is associated with a dysfunction in the autonomic nervous system, main symptoms of this dysfunction are in the following: Absence of sweat(anhidrosis) and flushing on one side of the face, neck, or upper thoracic area. In addition, other symptoms include cluster headaches, tearing of the eyes, nasal discharge, abnormal contraction of the pupils, weakness in neck muscles, and drooping of one side of the upper eyelid.[3]",
    "Causes": "One possible cause of Harlequin syndrome is a lesion to the preganglionic or postganglionic cervical sympathetic fibers and parasympathetic neurons of the ciliary ganglion.[7] It is also believed that torsion (twisting) of the thoracic spine can cause blockage of the anterior radicular artery leading to Harlequin syndrome.[8] The sympathetic deficit on the denervated side causes anhidrosis (lack of sweating). Patients with Horner's Syndrome may also experience this. The parasympathetic deficit on the denervated side causes the flushing of the opposite side to appear more pronounced. It is unclear whether or not the response of the undamaged side was normal or excessive, but it is believed that it could be a result of the body attempting to compensate for the damaged side and maintain homeostasis.[8]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis of Harlequin syndrome is made when the individual has consistent signs and symptoms of the condition, therefore, it is made by clinical observation. In addition, a neurologist or primary care physician may require an MRI test to rule out similar disorders such as Horner's syndrome, Adie's syndrome, and Ross' syndrome.[3] In an MRI, a radiologist may observe areas near brain or spinal cord for lesions, or any damage to the nerve endings. It is also important that the clinician rules out traumatic causes by performing autonomic function tests.[9] Such tests includes the following: tilt table test, orthostatic blood pressure measurement, head-up test, valsalva maneuver, thermoregulatory sweat test, tendon reflex test, and electrocardiography (ECG). CT scan of the heart and lungs may also be performed to rule out a structural underlying lesion.[10] The medical history of the individual should be carefully noted.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Harlequin syndrome is not debilitating, so treatment is not normally necessary.[6] In cases where the individual may feel socially embarrassed, contralateral sympathectomy may be considered, although compensatory flushing and sweating of other parts of the body may occur.[10] In contralateral sympathectomy, the nerve bundles that cause the flushing in the face are interrupted. This procedure causes both sides of the face to no longer flush or sweat. Since symptoms of Harlequin syndrome do not typically impair a person's daily life, this treatment is only recommended if a person is very uncomfortable with the flushing and sweating associated with the syndrome.[3]",

    "Disease": "Harlequin-type ichthyosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Newborns with harlequin-type ichthyosis present with thick, fissured armor-plate hyperkeratosis.[11] Sufferers feature severe cranial and facial deformities. The ears may be very poorly developed or absent, as may the nose. The eyelids may be everted (ectropion), which leaves the eyes and the area around them very susceptible to infection.[12] Babies with this condition often bleed during birth. The lips are pulled back by the dry skin (eclabium).[13]\nJoints sometimes lack movement and may be below the normal size. Hypoplasia is sometimes found in the fingers. Polydactyly has been found on occasion. The fish mouth appearance, mouth breathing, and xerostomia place affected individuals at extremely high risk for developing rampant dental decay.[14]\nPeople with this condition are extremely sensitive to changes in temperature due to their hard, cracked skin, which prevents normal heat loss. The skin also restricts respiration, which impedes the chest wall from expanding and drawing in enough air. This can lead to hypoventilation and respiratory failure. Patients are often dehydrated, as their plated skin is not well suited to retaining water.[13]",
    "Causes": "Harlequin-type ichthyosis is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the ABCA12 gene. This gene is important in regulating protein synthesis for the development of the skin layer. Mutations in the gene cause impaired transport of lipids in the skin layer and may also lead to shrunken versions of the proteins responsible for skin development. Less severe mutations result in a collodion membrane and congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma-like presentation.[15][16]\nABCA12 is an ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC transporter), which is a member of a large family of proteins that hydrolyze ATP to transport cargo across cell membranes. ABCA12 is thought to be a lipid transporter in keratinocytes necessary for lipid transport into lamellar granules during the formation of the lipid barrier in the skin.[17]",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of harlequin-type ichthyosis relies on both physical examination and laboratory tests. Physical assessment at birth is vital for the initial diagnosis of harlequin ichthyosis. Physical examination reveals characteristic symptoms of the condition, especially the abnormalities in the skin surface of newborns. Abnormal findings in physical assessments usually result in employing other diagnostic tests to ascertain the diagnosis.\nGenetic testing is the most specific diagnostic test for harlequin ichthyosis. This test reveals a loss of function mutation on the ABCA12 gene.[18] A skin biopsy may be done to assess the histologic characteristics of the cells. Histological findings usually reveal hyperkeratotic skin cells, which leads to a thick, white, and hard skin layer.",
    "Treatment": "Constant care is required to moisturize and protect the skin. The hard outer layer eventually peels off, exposing the vulnerable inner layers of the dermis. Early complications result from infection due to fissuring of the hyperkeratotic plates and respiratory distress due to physical restriction of chest wall expansion.[19]\nManagement includes supportive care and treatment of hyperkeratosis and skin barrier dysfunction. A humidified incubator is generally used. Intubation is often required until nares are present. Nutritional support with tube feeding is essential until eclabium resolves and infants can begin nursing. Ophthalmologic consultation is useful for the early management of ectropion, which is initially pronounced and resolves as scales are shed. Liberal application of petroleum jelly is needed multiple times daily.\nIn addition, careful debridement of constrictive bands of hyperkeratosis should be performed to avoid digital ischemia.[19] Cases of digital autoamputation or necrosis have been reported due to cutaneous constriction bands. Relaxation incisions have been used to prevent this complication.[19]",
    "Prognosis": "In the past, the disorder was nearly always fatal, whether due to dehydration, infection (sepsis), restricted breathing due to the plating, or other related causes. The most common cause of death was systemic infection, and sufferers rarely survived for more than a few days. Improved neonatal intensive care and early treatment with oral retinoids, such as the drug isotretinoin, may improve survival.[13][9] Early oral retinoid therapy has been shown to soften scales and encourage desquamation.[20] After as little as two weeks of daily oral isotretinoin, fissures in the skin can heal, and plate-like scales can nearly resolve. Improvement in the eclabium and ectropion can also be seen in weeks.\nChildren who survive the neonatal period usually develop a less severe phenotype, resembling a severe congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma. People continue to suffer from temperature dysregulation and may have heat and cold intolerance. Patients can have generalized poor hair growth, scarring alopecia, contractures of digits, arthralgias, failure to thrive, hypothyroidism, and short stature. Some patients develop a rheumatoid factor-positive polyarthritis.[21] Survivors can also develop fish-like scales and retention of a waxy, yellowish material in seborrheic areas, with ear adhered to the scalp.[citation needed]\nMost infants do not live past a week. Those who survive can live from around 10 months to 25 years thanks to advanced medicine.[22]\nA study published in 2011 in the Archives of Dermatology concluded: \"Harlequin ichthyosis should be regarded as a severe chronic disease that is not invariably fatal. Survival has increased with improved neonatal care and the early introduction of oral retinoids.[23]",

    "Disease": "Hartnup disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Hartnup disease manifests during infancy with variable clinical presentation: failure to thrive, photosensitivity, intermittent ataxia, nystagmus, and tremor.[citation needed]\nNicotinamide is necessary for neutral amino acid transporter production in the proximal renal tubules found in the kidney, and intestinal mucosal cells found in the small intestine.  Therefore, a symptom stemming from this disorder results in increased amounts of amino acids in the urine.\nPellagra, a similar condition, is also caused by low nicotinamide; this disorder results in dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia.[citation needed]\nHartnup disease is a disorder of amino acid transport in the intestine and kidneys; otherwise, the intestine and kidneys function normally, and the effects of the disease occur mainly in the brain and skin. Symptoms may begin in infancy or early childhood, but sometimes they begin as late as early adulthood. Symptoms may be triggered by sunlight, fever, drugs, or emotional or physical stress.  A period of poor nutrition nearly always precedes an attack. The attacks usually become progressively less frequent with age.  Most symptoms occur sporadically and are caused by a deficiency of niacinamide.  A rash develops on parts of the body exposed to the sun.  Mental retardation, short stature, headaches, unsteady gait, and collapsing or fainting are common.  Psychiatric problems (such as anxiety, rapid mood changes, delusions, and hallucinations) may also result.[6]",
    "Causes": "Hartnup disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Heterozygotes are normal. Consanguinity is common. The failure of amino-acid transport was reported in 1960 from the increased presence of indoles (bacterial metabolites of tryptophan) and tryptophan in the urine of patients as part of a generalized aminoaciduria of the disease. The excessive loss of tryptophan from malabsorption was the cause of the pellagra like symptoms. From studies on ingestion of tryptophan it seemed that there was a generalized problem with amino-acid transport.[7]\nIn 2004, a causative gene, SLC6A19, was located on band 5p15.33. SLC6A19 is a sodium-dependent and chloride-independent neutral amino acid transporter, expressed predominantly in the kidneys and intestine.[8]",
    "Diagnosis": "The defective gene controls the absorption of certain amino acids from the intestine and the reabsorption of those amino acids in the kidneys. Consequently, a person with Hartnup disease cannot absorb amino acids properly from the intestine and cannot reabsorb them properly from tubules in the kidneys.  Excessive amounts of amino acids, such as tryptophan, are excreted in the urine.  The  body is thus left with inadequate amounts of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. With too little tryptophan in the blood, the body is unable to make a sufficient amount of the B-complex vitamin niacinamide, particularly under stress when more vitamins are needed.[6]\nIn Hartnup disease, urinary excretion of proline, hydroxyproline, and arginine remains unchanged, differentiating it from other causes of generalized aminoaciduria, such as Fanconi syndrome. With urine chromatography, increased levels of neutral amino acids (e.g., glutamine, valine, phenylalanine, leucine, asparagine, citrulline, isoleucine, threonine, alanine, serine, histidine, tyrosine, tryptophan) and indican are found in the urine. Increased urinary indican can be tested by Obermeyer test.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "A high-protein diet can overcome the deficient transport of neutral amino acids in most patients.  Poor nutrition leads to more frequent and more severe attacks of the disease, which is otherwise asymptomatic. All patients who are symptomatic are advised to use physical and chemical protection from sunlight: avoid excessive exposure to sunlight, wear protective clothing, and use  chemical sunscreens with a SPF of 15 or greater. Patients also should avoid other aggravating factors, such as photosensitizing drugs, as much as possible.  In patients with niacin deficiency and symptomatic disease, daily supplementation with nicotinic acid or nicotinamide reduces both the number and severity of attacks.  Neurologic and psychiatric treatment is needed in patients with severe central nervous system involvement.[8]"

    "Disease": "Hemiballismus",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Ballism was defined by Meyers in 1968[8] as \"Repetitive, but constantly varying, large amplitude involuntary movements of the proximal parts of the limbs. This activity is almost ceaseless and movements are often complex and combined\". Hemiballismus is usually characterized by involuntary flinging motions of the extremities.[2] The movements are often violent and have wide amplitudes of motion.[9] They are continuous and random and can involve proximal or distal muscles on one side of the body. Some cases even include the facial muscles.[6] It is common for arms and legs to move together. The more a patient is active, the more the movements increase. With relaxation comes a decrease in movements.[10] Physicians can measure the severity of the disorder by having the patient perform a series of basic, predetermined tasks and counting the hemiballistic movements during a set time session.[11] The physicians then rate the patient on a severity scale. This scale gives scientists and clinicians a way to compare patients and determine the range of the disorder.[citation needed]\nThe name hemiballismus literally means \"half ballistic\", referring to the violent, flailing movements observed on one side of the body.",
    "Causes": "In examining the causes of hemiballismus, it is important to remember that this disorder is extremely rare. While hemiballismus can result from the following list, just because a patient has one of these disorders does not mean they will also experience hemiballismus.[citation needed]\nHemisballismus as a result of stroke occurs in only about 0.45 cases per hundred thousand stroke patients.[2] Even at such a small rate, stroke is by far the most common cause of hemiballismus.[12] A stroke causes tissue to die due to a lack of oxygen resulting from an impaired blood supply. In the basal ganglia, this can result in the death of tissue that helps to control movement. As a result, the brain is left with damaged tissue that sends damaged signals to the skeletal muscles in the body. The result is occasionally a patient with hemiballismus.[citation needed]\nHemiballismus can also occur as a result of a traumatic brain injury. There are cases in which survivors of assault or other forms of violence have developed hemiballismus.[5] Through these acts of violence, the survivor's brain has been damaged and the hemiballistic movements have developed.[citation needed]\nThis disease causes neuronal loss and gliosis, which can include the subthalamic nucleus and other areas of the brain.[13] Essentially any disorder that causes some form of neuronal loss or gliosis in the basal ganglia has the potential to cause hemiballismus.[citation needed]\nPatients with nonketotic hyperglycemia can develop hemiballismus as a complication to the disease through the development of a subthalamic nucleus lesion.[14] This is the second most common reported cause of hemiballismus. It can be found primarily in the elderly and many of the reported cases have come from East Asian origin, which suggests that there may be some genetic disposition to development of hemiballismus as a result of hyperglycemia. Hemiballistic movements appear when blood glucose levels get too high and then subside once glucose levels return to normal. This time scale for this is usually several hours. In patients with this type of hemiballismus, imaging reveals abnormalities in the putamen contralateral to the movements as well as the globus pallidus and caudate nucleus. While the hyperglycemia itself is not the cause of the hemiballistic movements, it has been suggested that petechial hemorrhage or a decreased production of GABA and acetylcholine could result secondary to the hyperglycemia. One of these issues could be responsible for the hemiballistic movements.[10]\nA neoplasm is an abnormal growth of cells. Cases have shown that if this occurs somewhere in the basal ganglia, hemiballismus can result.[10]\nVascular malformations can cause abnormal blood flow to areas of the brain. If too little blood is delivered to the basal ganglia, a stroke can occur.[10]\nThis is another form of tumor that can result in the brain as a result of a tuberculous meningitis infection. This type of tumor can also damage parts of the basal ganglia, sometimes resulting in hemiballismus.[10]\nDemyelinating plaques attack the myelin sheaths on neurons. This decreases the conduction velocity of the neurons, making the signals received by the basal ganglia garbled and incomplete. This disorganized signal can also cause the chaotic movements characterized by hemiballismus.[10]\nPatients with HIV often have complications that arise along with AIDS. Hypoglycemia due to pentamidine use in patients with AIDS has been known to cause hemiballismus. In some patients, hemiballismus has been the only visible symptom to alert the physician that the patients may have AIDS. It is typically a result of a secondary infection that occurs due to the compromised immune system and the most common infection causing hemiballismus is cerebral toxoplasmosis. Most of the lesions that result from this infection are found in the basal ganglia. As long as the diagnosis is not missed, this type of hemiballismus can be treated just as well as in patients without HIV.[10]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis of hemiballismus is a clinical one, made with observation during clinical examination. Hemiballismus is a clinical sign with a number of different causes. Therefore, a diagnosis underlying this clinical sign should be sought. The observer should note sudden, flinging movements of a limb(s) and occasionally the face. This is commonly unilateral (\"Hemiballismus\"). The movements must be distinguished from other hyperkinetic movement disorders such as tremor (generally more rhythmic, and smaller amplitude) and chorea, akathisia and athetosis (all are often of lower amplitude and less violent).[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "When treating hemiballismus, it is first important to treat whatever may be causing the manifestation of this disorder. This could be hyperglycemia, infections, or neoplastic lesions. Some patients may not even need treatment because the disorder is not severe and can be self-limited.[10]\nWhen pharmacological treatment is necessary, the most standard type of drug to use is an antidopaminergic drug. Blocking dopamine is effective in about ninety percent of patients. Perphenazine, pimozide, haloperidol, and chlorpromazine are standard choices for treatment. Scientists are still unsure as to why this form of treatment works, as dopamine has not been directly linked to hemiballismus.[10]\nAn anticonvulsant called topiramate has helped patients in three cases and may be a viable treatment for the future.[16]\nIntrathecal baclofen (ITB) therapy is used to treat a variety of movement disorders such as cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis. It can also be a possibility to help treat hemiballismus.[5] In one case, before ITB the patient had an average of 10–12 ballism episodes of the right lower limb per hour. During episodes, the right hip would flex up to about 90 degrees, with a fully extended knee. After an ITB pump was implanted and the correct dosage was found, the frequency of ballistic right leg movements decreased to about three per day, and the right hip flexed to only 30 degrees. The patient was also able to better isolate individual distal joint movements in the right lower limb. The patient currently receives 202.4 microg/day of ITB and continues to benefit almost 6 years after the ITB pump was implanted.[5]\nNew uses for botulinum toxin have included treatment of hemiballismus. However, this is still in the early stages of testing. This treatment deals with the muscular manifestations of hemiballismus as opposed to the neurological causes.[5][10]\nTetrabenazine has been used to treat other movement disorders, but is now being used to treat hemiballismus. Patients using this medication have had a dramatic response. However, lowering the dosage leads to a return of symptoms. This drug works by depleting dopamine.[6]\nIn one case, a patient had not been responding to haloperidol, thus the physician tried olanzapine. The patient made a significant recovery. More research is being performed on the use of these types of drugs in treating hemiballismus.[11]\nSurgery as a treatment should only be used on patients with severe hemiballismus that has not responded to treatment. Lesioning of the globus pallidus or deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus are procedures that can be used on humans. Usually, lesioning is favored over deep brain stimulation because of the maintenance required to continue stimulating the brain correctly and effectively.[10]",
    "Prognosis": "In the past, the prognosis for patients with this disease had been very poor; with many patients experiencing severe disability or death. Now, patients are responding remarkably well to current treatments and the majority of patients go into spontaneous remission. For those that do not go into remission, the symptoms of hemiballismus can generally be very well controlled with medication.[10]\nDue to the rarity of this disorder, scientists know very little about the details of hemiballismus."

    "Disease": "Hemiplegic migraine",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Hemiplegia (Greek 'hemi' = Half), is a condition that affects one side of the body. Signs of a hemiplegic migraine attack are similar to what would be presented in a stroke that typically includes sudden severe headache on one side of the brain, weakness of half the body, ataxia and aphasia which can last for hours, days or weeks. [2]",
    "Causes": "Symptoms of weakness during a hemiplegic migraine attack are a result of motor aura. The aura displayed during a migraine episode is  believed to be caused by a phenomenon known as cortical spreading depression.\nFor those not at risk due to a family history of hemiplegic migraines, the current medical discussion indicates that genetic factors may still play a role. Some scientific studies have indicated that a percentage of those who suffer from hemiplegic migraines may have mutations of the CACNA1A and the ATP1A2 genes.[3]",
    "Diagnosis": "The ICHD classification and diagnosis of migraine distinguish 6 subtypes of hemiplegic migraine.[4] Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) can be loosely divided into two categories: with and without cerebellar signs. Cerebellar signs refer to ataxia, sometimes episodic and other times progressive, that can accompany FHM1 mutations and is caused by degeneration of the cerebellum. These cerebellar signs result in a phenotypic overlap between FHM and both episodic ataxia and spinocerebellar ataxia. This is unsurprising as subtypes of these disorders (FHM1, EA2 and SCA6) are allelic, i.e., they result from mutations in the same gene. The other forms of FHM seem to be distinguishable only on the basis of their genetic cause.[citation needed]\nFamilial hemiplegic migraine is a form of hemiplegic migraine headache that runs in families.[5] Hemiplegic migraine is inherited via autosomal dominant manner.",
    "Epidemiology": "Migraine itself is a very common disorder, occurring in 15–20% of the population. Hemiplegic migraine, be it familial or spontaneous, is less prevalent, 0.01% prevalence according to one report.[7] Women are three times more likely to be affected than men.[citation needed]"

    "Signs and symptoms": "Features of hepatic veno-occlusive disease include weight gain, tender enlargement of the liver, ascites, and yellow discoloration of the skin; it often is associated with acute kidney failure.[4]",
    "Diagnosis": "Doppler ultrasound of the liver is typically utilized to confirm or suggest the diagnosis. Common findings on liver doppler ultrasound include increased phasicity of portal veins with eventual development of portal flow reversal. The liver is usually enlarged but maintained normal echogenicity. A liver biopsy is required for a definitive diagnosis.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment generally includes supportive care including pain management and possibly diuretics.[5] In those with severe disease due to a bone marrow transplant, defibrotide is a proposed treatment.[6] It has been approved for use in severe cases in Europe and the United States.[7][8] A placebo controlled trial, however, has not been done as of 2016.[5]",
    "Prognosis": "Mild disease has a risk of death of about 10% while moderate disease has a risk of death of 20%.[5] When it occurs as a result of bone marrow transplant and multiorgan failure is present, the risk of death is greater than 80%.[6]"

    "Disease": "Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Almost all women present with uterine fibroids, approximately 76% with dermal manifestations and 10–16% with renal tumors.[3]\nThe uterine fibroids tend to occur at younger age and are larger and more numerous than in the general population. They may be distinguishable from sporadic fibroids by special histological features such as prominent nucleoli with perinucleolar halos.[4]\nThe skin presentation is of asymmetrical, reddish-brown nodules or papules with a firm consistency, predominantly located on the limbs (multiple cutaneous leiomyoma), although they may occur anywhere, including the face. The lesions, which are typically painful and most often present during the third decade of life, are piloleiomyomata—a benign smooth muscle tumour arising from the arrectores pilorum muscles of the skin. These tumours may also arise in the tunica dartos of the scrotum and the mammillary muscle of the nipple (genital leiomyoma), the smooth muscle of blood vessels (angioleiomyoma) and the lung (pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis).[5] A pseudo-Darier sign may be present.\nThe renal cell carcinoma tends to be of the papillary (type 2) form and tends to occur more commonly in women than men with this syndrome. These cancers present earlier than is usual for renal cell carcinomas (typically in the twenties and thirties) and tend to be at relatively advanced stages at presentation. Tumours have rarely been reported in children. These tumours occur in ~20% of those with this mutation suggesting that other factors are involved in the pathogenesis.\nThese growths increase in size and number throughout the lifetime.[6] People with HLRCC have an approximately 15% chance of developing renal cell carcinoma in their lifetime.[7] This is most commonly type II papillary renal cell carcinoma, which is an aggressive form.[6]\nOther relatively rare conditions have been reported in association with this disease. It is not yet known if these associations are fortuitous or manifestations of the condition itself.\nCerebral cavernomas and massive, macronodular adrenocortical disease have also been reported in association with this syndrome.[8][9] A case of cutis verticis gyrata, disseminated collagenoma and Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease in association with a mutation in the fumarate hydratase gene has also been reported.[10] Two cases of ovarian mucinous cystadenoma have also been reported with this mutation.[11]",
    "Causes": "HLRCC is an autosomal dominant condition caused by a mutation in the FH gene, which results in dysfunction of the citric acid cycle, leading to an accumulation of fumarate.[7][12]\nThe fumarate hydratase gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q42.3-43), spans 22 kilobases and has 10 exons; the first exon codes for a signal peptide.",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is made either by testing of the fumarate hydratase activity in cultured skin fibroblasts or lymphoblastoid cells and demonstrating reduced activity (≤60%) or by molecular genetic testing.[3] Special histologic features of fibroids may allow an early diagnosis in absence of other symptoms.[4]\nThe skin lesions may be difficult to diagnose clinically but a punch biopsy will usually reveal a Grenz zone [1] separating the tumour from the overlying skin. Histological examination shows dense dermal nodules composed of elongated cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm arranged in fascicles (spindle cells). The nuclei are uniform, blunt-ended and cigar-shaped with only occasional mitoses. Special stains that may be of use in the diagnosis include Masson's trichrome, Van Gieson's stain and phosphotungstic acid–haematoxylin.\nThe renal cell carcinomas have prominent eosinophilic nucleoli surrounded by a clear halo.\nDifferential diagnosis of this condition includes the Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome and tuberous sclerosis. As the skin lesions are typically painful, it is also often necessary to exclude other painful tumors of the skin (including blue rubber bleb nevus, leiomyoma, eccrine spiradenoma, neuroma, dermatofibroma, angiolipoma, neurilemmoma, endometrioma, glomus tumor and granular cell tumor; the mnemonic \"BLEND-AN-EGG\" may be helpful). Other skin lesions that may need to be considered include cylindroma, lipoma, poroma and trichoepithelioma; these tend to be painless and have other useful distinguishing features.",
    "Treatment": "Leiomyomas do not typically require treatment unless they cause pain.[6] The skin lesions may be difficult to treat as they tend to recur after excision or destructive treatment.  Drugs which affect smooth muscle contraction, such as doxazosin, nitroglycerine, nifedipine and phenoxybenzamine, may provide pain relief.\nUterine fibroids can be treated with the same methods as sporadic uterine fibroids including anti-hormonal treatment, surgery, or embolisation. Substantially elevated risk of progression to or independent development of uterine leiomyosarcoma has been reported which may influence treatment methods.[3]\nThe predisposition to renal cell cancer calls for screening and, if necessary, urological management.\nTopical lidocaine patches have been reported to decrease the severity and frequency of pain associated with cutaneous leiomyomas.[17]",
    "Prognosis": "A 2006 review stated that Reed's Syndrome often is the leading cause of renal cancer between ages 30–50. Renal cancer kills about 1 in 3 people, but 5-year survival rates improved between 1974–1976 and 1995–2000, from 52% to 64%.[18]",
    "Epidemiology": "HLRCC affects males and females equally.[6] Thus far, HLRCC has been found in 300 families worldwide.[12]"

    "Disease": "Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type I",
    "Signs and symptoms": "At the beginning, affected individuals often notice the loss of pain and temperature sensation or all sensory modalities in their feet. As the disease progresses, the sensory abnormalities may extend up to the knees. However, they often do not notice sensory loss for a long time.[5] Many affected individuals only become aware of the disease when they notice painless injuries and burns or when they seek medical advice for slowly healing wounds or foot ulcers. Foot ulcerations may appear due to permanent pressure, such as long walks or badly fitting shoes. Minor wounds or blisters may then lead to deep foot ulcerations. Once infection occurs, complications such as inflammation and destruction of the underlying bones may follow.[1][2][3][6] Affected individuals who do not lose sensation may experience spontaneous pain.[3] In addition, many affected individuals exhibit, to a variable degree, symmetrical distal muscle weakness and wasting.[7][6]\nHSAN I is characterized by marked sensory disturbances mainly as the loss of pain and temperature sensation in the distal parts of the lower limbs. The loss of sensation can also extend to the proximal parts of the lower limbs and the upper limbs as the disease progresses.[2] Some affected individuals do not lose sensation, but instead experience severe shooting, burning, and lancinating pains in the limbs or in the trunk. Autonomic disturbances, if present, manifest as decreased sweating.[3][8] The degree of motor disturbances is highly variable, even within families, ranging from absent to severe distal muscle weakness and wasting.[1]\nThe disease progresses slowly, but often disables the affected individuals severely after a long duration. The onset of the disease varies between the 2nd and 5th decade of life,[2] albeit congenital or childhood onset has occasionally been reported.[1][9] With the progression of the disease, the affected individuals lose the ability to feel pain in their feet and legs. Minor injuries in the painless area can result in slow-healing wounds which, if not immediately recognized, can develop into chronic ulcerations. Once infection occurs, these ulcerations can result in severe complications that lead to foot deformity, such as inflammation of the underlying bones, spontaneous bone fractures, and progressive degeneration of weight-bearing joints. Furthermore, foot deformity promotes skin changes such as hyperkeratosis at pressure points. These complications may necessitate amputation of the affected foot.[3][8]\nBiopsies of severely affected sural nerve (short saphenous nerve) in patients with HSAN I showed evidence of neuronal degeneration. Only a very few myelinated fibers were observed some of which showed a sign of primary (segmental) demyelination. A reasonable number of unmyelinated axons remained, although the presence of stacks of flattened Schwann cell processes suggested unmyelinated axon loss.[1] Electrophysiological testing provides additional evidence that neuronal degeneration underlies the disease. Sensory potentials are usually absent in the lower limbs but are often recordable or even normal in the upper limbs of the patients.[1][3] In addition, motor conduction is slow, possibly implying a demyelinating process.[10][11]",
    "Causes": "Advances in molecular genetics have enabled identification of most genes associated with HSAN I. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the disease are not fully understood and are under investigation. One of challenges in the investigation is to elucidate how faulty genes that are ubiquitously expressed and are involved in basic cellular functions, such as sphingolipid metabolism, maintenance of organellar integrity, membrane dynamics, and transcription regulation, affect specific populations of neurons.[8]\nHSAN IA is associated with heterozygous missense mutations in the SPTLC1 gene.[9][12][13][14] The gene encodes SPTLC1 protein, which together with SPTLC2 protein, forms serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) in humans. SPT is a pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in the de novo biosynthesis of sphingolipids.[15] Together with cholesterol, sphingolipids form the main component of lipid rafts, structures in the plasma membrane that facilitate efficient signal transduction.[16] Many intermediate sphingoid bases and their derivatives, as well as complex sphingolipids, are active as extracellular and intracellular regulators of growth, differentiation, migration, survival, and cellular responses to stress.[17]\nInitially, mutations in the SPTLC1 gene were associated with increased activity of SPT.[12] Subsequent studies rather suggested that the mutations reduce the activity of the enzyme.[18][19] However, it cannot account for the aberrant sphingolipid-related cellular features in heterozygous patient-derived cells[20] or the HSAN IA clinical features in heterozygous mice.[21] These results suggest that the activity of non-mutant SPTLC1 protein may be sufficient for maintaining normal sphingolipid biosynthesis and cell viability. Therefore, the neuronal degeneration in HSAN IA is likely due to subtler and rather long-term effects of the mutations or perhaps accumulation of toxic lipids produced by mutant enzymes.[20]\nFurther studies supported the latter notion. The mutations have been shown in vitro to facilitate substrate promiscuity of SPT. Mutant SPT mediates the condensation not only of its normal substrate serine, but also of alanine or glycine, with palmitoyl-coenzyme A. The reactions lead to the formation of two aberrant sphingolipid metabolites 1-deoxy-sphinganine and 1-deoxymethyl-sphinganine, respectively. As the metabolites lack a hydroxyl group that is required for their further conversion and degradation, they accumulate inside the cell.[22][23]  The metabolites have been shown to be more toxic to sensory neurons than to motor neurons.[22] They accumulate in the peripheral nervous system where HSAN manifest, but not in the central nervous system in mice bearing a HSAN IA-associated mutation.[24] Furthermore, serine-enriched diet reduced the levels of the metabolites and improved sensory and motor performance of the mice. A small-scale clinical trial also showed similar results. These studies demonstrated that an altered substrate selectivity of the mutant SPT is the key to the pathophysiology of HSAN IA.[25]\nHSAN IB is linked to a 3.42 cM interval on chromosome 3p22–p24.[26] This finding was confirmed in another family with similar clinical features. However, mutation analysis of genes in the candidate region has not revealed any disease-causing gene.[27] Since then, this rare form of HSAN I has not been reported in other families. The gene associated with the disease still remains to be identified.[citation needed]\nHSAN IC is associated with heterozygous missense mutations in the SPTLC2 gene. The gene encodes SPTLC2 protein which is one of two subunits of SPT. As mutations in the gene affect the same enzyme as those in the SPTLC1 gene, the molecular basis of the disease is suggested to be the same as that of HSAN IA.[28]\nHSAN ID is caused by heterozygous missense mutations in the ATL1 gene which encodes atlastin-1.[29] Atlastin-1 is a member of the dynamin/Mx/guanylate-binding protein superfamily of large GTPases. The enzyme contains an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention moiety, indicating that it functions predominantly in the organelle. It is highly expressed in the mammalian central nervous system and is enriched in the hippocampus and pyramidal neurons.[30] However, information on the expression of the gene in the peripheral nervous system is still lacking.[8]\nIn fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), atlastin-1 has been shown to induce tethering and fusion of membranes adjacent to the ER to help maintain the integrity of the ER.[31] The function of atlastin-1 is crucially dependent on its GTPase activity. In humans, a HSAN ID-associated mutation caused significant loss of the GTPase activity of the enzyme, leading to prominent disruption of ER network.[29] In addition to maintaining the integrity of the ER, atlastin-1 also has neuron-related functions. The enzyme is implicated in the trafficking and signaling of type I bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptors in zebra fish (Danio rerio). BMP signaling is involved in axon guidance and synapse formation, as well as axonal transport and the organization of the microtubule network in developing neurons. The signaling is disturbed in several neurodegenerative disorders.[32] It also regulates membrane dynamics in the neuronal growth cone in rat.[33]\nMutations in the ATL1 gene are also a common cause of early-onset hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) in humans.[34] The disease is characterized by progressive stiffness and contraction (spasticity) in the lower limbs due to damage to or dysfunction of the nerves. The vast majority of HSP-associated mutations are missense mutations that are scattered throughout the affected protein. Some of these mutations have been shown to reduce the GTPase activity of atlastin-1 in vitro.[33] However, the unique molecular signature of the mutations or the functional domains of the ATL1 gene that are affected in patients with HSAN ID and HSP that could explain the differences in clinical features between these two diseases are not clear. This finding indicates that additional genetic and/or environmental factors may modulate the clinical manifestation of the main causative mutation.[8]\nHSAN IE is associated with heterozygous missense mutations in the DNMT1 gene which encodes DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1).[35] Dnmt1 belongs to a family of enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl methionine to DNA. Dnmt1 has a high preference for hemimethylated DNA, hence it is called maintenance methyltransferase. The protein also has de novo DNA methyltransferase activity which is responsible for establishing methylation patterns during embryonic development.[36] Dnmt1 is highly expressed in post-mitotic neurons in the adult central nervous system, with peak expression during the S-phase of the cell cycle.[37]\nThe mutations are located in the DNA-sequence-targeting domain of Dnmt1 which is responsible for chromatin binding during the late S-phase and for sustaining the association of Dnmt1 with DNA during the G2 and M-phases of the cell cycle. Mutant Dnmt1 is misfolded and unable to bind to heterochromatin after the S-phase. Therefore, the mutant proteins are quickly targeted for degradation. In patients with the mutations, global hypomethylation and local hypermethylation are observed in their genomic DNA. These observations establish a formal causal link between DNA methylation defects and a disease of the peripheral nervous system.[36]",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of HSAN I is based on the observation of symptoms described above and is supported by a family history suggesting autosomal dominant inheritance. The diagnosis is also supported by additional tests, such as nerve conduction studies in the lower limbs to confirm a sensory and motor neuropathy. In sporadic cases, acquired neuropathies, such as the diabetic foot syndrome and alcoholic neuropathy, can be excluded by the use of magnetic resonance imaging and by interdisciplinary discussion between neurologists, dermatologists, and orthopedics.[1][2]\nThe diagnosis of the disease has been revolutionized by the identification of the causative genes. The diagnosis is now based on the detection of the mutations by direct sequencing of the genes. Nevertheless, the accurate phenotyping of patients remains crucial in the diagnosis.[4] For pregnant patients, termination of pregnancy is not recommended.[1][2]\nHSAN I must be distinguished from hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN) and other types of hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSAN II-V). The prominent sensory abnormalities and foot ulcerations are the only signs to separate HSAN I from HMSN.[2][38][39] HSAN II can be differentiated from HSAN I as it is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, it has earlier disease onset, the sensory loss is diffused to the whole body, and it has less or no motor symptoms. HSAN III-V can be easily distinguished from HSAN I because of congenital disease onset. Moreover, these types exhibit typical features, such as the predominant autonomic disturbances in HSAN III or congenital loss of pain and anhidrosis in HSAN IV.[1][2]\nIn 1993, Peter James Dyck divided HSAN I further into five subtypes HSAN IA-E based on the presence of additional features. These features were thought to result from the genetic diversity of HSAN I (i.e. the expression of different genes, different alleles of a single gene, or modifying genes) or environmental factors.[40] Molecular genetic studies later confirmed the genetic diversity of the disease.[41]",
    "Treatment": "Gene-based therapies for patients with HSAN I are not available to date, hence supportive care is the only treatment available for the patients. Ulcero-mutilating complications are the most serious, prominent, and leading diagnostic features in HSAN I. Since the complications mimic foot ulcers caused by diabetic neuropathy, the treatment for foot ulcers and infections can follow the guidelines given for diabetic foot care which starts with early and accurate counseling of patients about risk factors for developing foot ulcerations. Orthopedic care and the use of well fitting shoes without pressure points should also be included. Recently, the treatment of the foot complications has reached an efficient level allowing treatment on an outpatient basis. Early treatment of the foot complications often avoids hospitalization and, in particular, amputations. In sum, the principles of the treatment are removal of pressure to the ulcers, eradication of infection, and specific protective footwear afterwards.[1][2]\nGenetic counseling is an important tool for preventing new cases if this is wished by at-risk family members. Appropriate genetic counseling is based on an accurate diagnosis. Therefore, clinicians and genetic counselors should use ulcero-mutilating complications as the main diagnostic criteria.[43] Since the disease is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, there is a Mendelian risk of 50% for subsequent generations regardless of their sex. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the disease-causing mutation has been identified in the family. Predictive testing is useful for young people to avoid serious complications of the disease.[1][2]",
    "Prognosis": "If patients with HSAN I receive appropriate treatment and counseling, the prognosis is good. Early treatment of foot infections may avoid serious complications. Nevertheless, the complications are manageable, thus allowing an acceptable quality of life. The disease progresses slowly and does not influence the life expectancy if signs and symptoms are properly treated.[1][2]",
    "Epidemiology": "HSAN I constitutes a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of diseases of low prevalence. Detailed epidemiological data are currently not available. The frequency of the disease is still reflected by reports of a handful affected families. Although the impressive clinical features of HSAN I are seen by neurologists, general practitioners, orthopedists, and dermatologists, the condition might still be under-recognized particularly for sporadic cases and patients who do not exhibit the characteristic clinical features.[1][2]"

    "Disease": "Hereditary spastic paraplegia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Symptoms depend on the type of HSP inherited. The main feature of the disease is progressive spasticity in the lower limbs due to pyramidal tract dysfunction. This also results in brisk reflexes, extensor plantar reflexes, muscle weakness, and variable bladder disturbances. Furthermore, among the core symptoms of HSP are also included abnormal gait and difficulty in walking, decreased vibratory sense at the ankles, and paresthesia.[8]\nIndividuals with HSP can experience extreme fatigue associated with central nervous system and neuromuscular disorders, which can be disabling.[9][10][11] Initial symptoms are typically difficulty with balance, stubbing the toe or stumbling. Symptoms of HSP may begin at any age, from infancy to older than 60 years. If symptoms begin during the teenage years or later, then spastic gait disturbance usually progresses over many years. Canes, walkers, and wheelchairs may eventually be required, although some people never require assistance devices.[12] Disability has been described as progressing more rapidly in adult onset forms.[13]\nMore specifically, patients with the autosomal dominant pure form of HSP reveal normal facial and extraocular movement. Although jaw jerk may be brisk in older subjects, there is no speech disturbance or difficulty of swallowing. Upper extremity muscle tone and strength are normal. In the lower extremities, muscle tone is increased at the hamstrings, quadriceps and ankles. Weakness is most notable at the iliopsoas, tibialis anterior, and to a lesser extent, hamstring muscles.[13]\nIn the complex form of the disorder, additional symptoms are present. These include: peripheral neuropathy, amyotrophy, ataxia, intellectual disability, ichthyosis, epilepsy, optic neuropathy, dementia, deafness, or problems with speech, swallowing or breathing.[14]\nAnita Harding[7] classified the HSP in a pure and complicated form. Pure HSP presents with spasticity in the lower limbs, associated with neurogenic bladder disturbance as well as lack of vibration sensitivity (pallhypesthesia). On the other hand, HSP is classified as complex when lower limb spasticity is combined with any additional neurological symptom.[citation needed]\nThis classification is subjective and patients with complex HSPs are sometimes diagnosed as having cerebellar ataxia with spasticity, intellectual disability (with spasticity), or  leukodystrophy.[7] Some of the genes listed below have been described in other diseases than HSP before. Therefore, some key genes overlap with other disease groups.[citation needed]\nIn the past, HSP has been classified as early onset beginning in early childhood or later onset in adulthood. The age of onsets has two points of maximum at age 2 and around age 40.[15] New findings propose that an earlier onset leads to a longer disease duration without loss of ambulation or the need for the use of a wheelchair.[15] This was also described earlier, that later onset forms evolve more rapidly.[13]  However, this is not always the case as De Novo Early Onset SPG4, a form of infantile HSP, involves loss of ambulation and other motor skills.",
    "Causes": "HSP is a group of genetic disorders. It follows general inheritance rules and can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive manner. The mode of inheritance involved has a direct impact on the chances of inheriting the disorder. Over 70 genotypes had been described, and over 50 genetic loci have been linked to this condition.[16] Ten genes have been identified with autosomal dominant inheritance. One of these, SPG4, accounts for ~50% of all genetically solved cases, or approximately 25% of all HSP cases.[15] Twelve genes are known to be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Collectively this latter group account for ~1/3 cases.[citation needed]\nMost altered genes have known function, but for some the function haven't been identified yet. All of them are listed in the gene list below, including their mode of inheritance.  Some examples are spastin (SPG4) and paraplegin (SPG7) are both AAA ATPases.[17]\nThe genes are designated SPG (Spastic gait gene). The gene locations are in the format: chromosome - arm (short or p: long or q) - band number. These designations are for the human genes only. The locations may (and probably will) vary in other organisms.\nDespite the number of genes known to be involved in this condition ~40% of cases have yet to have their cause identified.[18] In the table below SPG? is used to indicate a gene that has been associated with HSP but has not yet received an official HSP gene designation.",
    "Diagnosis": "Initial diagnosis of HSPs relies upon family history, the presence or absence of additional signs and the exclusion of other nongenetic causes of spasticity, the latter being particular important in sporadic cases.[7]\nCerebral and spinal MRI is an important procedure performed in order to rule out other frequent neurological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, but also to detect associated abnormalities such as cerebellar or corpus callosum atrophy as well as white matter abnormalities. Differential diagnosis of HSP should also exclude spastic diplegia which presents with nearly identical day-to-day effects and even is treatable with similar medicines such as baclofen and orthopedic surgery; at times, these two conditions may look and feel so similar that the only perceived difference may be HSP's hereditary nature versus the explicitly non-hereditary nature of spastic diplegia (however, unlike spastic diplegia and other forms of spastic cerebral palsy, HSP cannot be reliably treated with selective dorsal rhizotomy).[citation needed]\nUltimate confirmation of HSP diagnosis can only be provided by carrying out genetic tests targeted towards known genetic mutations.[citation needed]\nHereditary spastic paraplegias can be classified based on the symptoms; mode of inheritance; the patient's age at onset; the affected genes; and biochemical pathways involved.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "No specific treatment is known that would prevent, slow, or reverse HSP. Available therapies mainly consist of symptomatic medical management and promoting physical and emotional well-being.[citation needed] Therapeutics offered to HSP patients include:",
    "Prognosis": "Although HSP is a progressive condition, the prognosis for individuals with HSP varies greatly. It primarily affects the legs although there can be some upperbody involvement in some individuals. Some cases are seriously disabling whilst others leave people able to do most ordinary activities to an ordinary extent without needing adjustments. The majority of individuals with HSP have a normal life expectancy.[14]",
    "Epidemiology": "Worldwide, the prevalence of all hereditary spastic paraplegias combined is estimated to be 2 to 6 in 100,000 people.[32] A Norwegian study of more than 2.5 million people published in March 2009 has found an HSP prevalence rate of 7.4/100,000 of population – a higher rate, but in the same range as previous studies. No differences in rate relating to gender were found, and average age at onset was 24 years.[33] In the United States, Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia is listed as a \"rare disease\" by the Office of Rare Diseases (ORD) of the National Institutes of Health which means that the disorder affects less than 200,000 people in the US population.[32]"

    "Disease": "Hidradenitis suppurativa",
    "Causes": "The exact cause of hidradenitis suppurativa remains unknown,[11][14] and there has, in the recent past, been notable disagreement among experts in this regard.[15] The condition, however, likely stems from both genetic and environmental causes.[3] Specifically, an immune-mediated pathology has been proposed,[11] although environmental factors have not been ruled out.[3]\nLesions will occur in any body area with hair follicles,[15] and/or sweat glands.[16] Areas such as the axilla, groin, and perineal region are more commonly involved. This theory includes most of these potential indicators:[17]\nThe historical understanding of the disease suggests dysfunctional apocrine glands[19] or dysfunctional hair follicles,[20] possibly triggered by a blocked gland, which creates inflammation, pain, and a swollen lesion.\nSeveral triggering factors should be taken into consideration:\nSome cases have been found to result from mutations in the NCSTN, PSEN1, or PSENEN genes. The genes produce proteins that are all components of a complex called gamma- (γ-) secretase. This complex cuts apart (cleaves) many different proteins, which is a crucial step in several chemical signaling pathways. One of these pathways, known as notch signaling, is essential for the normal maturation and division of hair follicle cells and other types of skin cells. Notch signaling influences normal immune system function. Studies suggest mutations in the NCSTN, PSEN1, or PSENEN genes impair notch signaling in hair follicles. Although little is known about the mechanism, abnormal notch signaling appears to promote the development of nodules and lead to skin inflammation.[33] In addition,  the composition of the intestinal microflora and as a consequence dietary patterns appear to play a role. Although dysbiosis of the cutaneous microbiome apparent in HS is not observed, the concurrent existence of inflammatory gut and skin diseases has led to the hypothesis of a gut-skin axis in which gut microbiota is implicated. Indeed, analysis of bacterial taxa in fecal samples from HS patients supports the possibility of a role for intestinal microbial alterations in this chronic inflammatory skin disease.[34]\nPrecocious puberty is more common among children and adolescents with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) compared to those without the condition, according to a recent case-control study.[35]\nAn analysis of the Explorys database revealed that pediatric patients with precocious puberty have double the risk of developing HS, even after adjusting for factors like demographic characteristics and body mass index (BMI).[36]",
    "Diagnosis": "Early diagnosis is essential in avoiding tissue damage. However, HS is often misdiagnosed or diagnosed late due to healthcare professionals not being aware of the condition or people not consulting with a physician.[37][38] Globally, the diagnosis is delayed more than 7 years in average after symptoms appear. This is much longer than with other skin conditions.[39]\nHidradenitis suppurativa presents itself in three stages.[19][41] Due to the large spectrum of clinical severity and the severe impact on quality of life, a reliable method for evaluating HS severity is needed.[citation needed]\nHurley's staging system was the first classification system proposed and is still in use for the classification of patients with skin diseases (i.e., psoriasis, HS, acne). Hurley separated patients into three groups based largely on the presence and extent of cicatrization and sinuses. It has been used as a basis for clinical trials in the past and to determine appropriate therapy for patients. These three stages are based on Hurley's staging system, which relies on the subjective extent of the diseased tissue. Hurley's three stages of hidradenitis suppurativa are:[42]\nThe Sartorius staging system is more sophisticated than Hurley's. Sartorius et al. suggested that the Hurley system is not sophisticated enough to assess treatment effects in clinical trials during research. This classification allows for better dynamic monitoring of the disease severity in individual patients. The elements of this staging system are:[43]\nPoints are accumulated in the above categories and added to give a regional and total score. In addition, the authors recommend adding a visual analog scale for pain or using the dermatology life quality index (DLQI, or the 'skindex') when assessing HS.[44]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment depends upon the presentation and severity of the disease. Due to the poorly studied nature of the disease, the effectiveness of medications and therapies was unclear.[45] Clear and sensitive communication from health care professionals, and social and psychological interventions can help manage the emotional impact of the condition and aid necessary lifestyle changes.[37][38] In May 2023, the European Commission (EC) approved Cosentyx (secukinumab) for active moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa in adults.[46]\nOther possible treatments include the following:\nCryotherapy has demonstrated efficacy against the disease, with 88% of persistent lesions resolving in a clinical trial of 23 patients.[47]\nWarm baths may be tried in those with mild disease.[4] Weight loss and smoking cessation are recommended.[2]\nWhen the process becomes chronic, wide surgical excision is the procedure of choice.\nWounds in the affected area do not heal by secondary intention, and immediate or delayed application of a split-thickness skin graft is an option.[17]\nAnother option is covering the defect with a perforator flap. With this technique, the (mostly totally excised) defect is covered with tissue from an area nearby. For example, the axilla with a fully excised defect of 15 × 7 cm can be covered with a thoracodorsal artery perforator flap.[citation needed]. A less invasive excision procedure called Skin-Tissue-sparing Excision with Electrosurgical Peeling or \"STEEP\" has also been developed for treating moderate to severe disease.[61]",
    "Prognosis": "In stage III disease, as classified by Hurley's staging system, fistulae left undiscovered, undiagnosed, or untreated can rarely lead to the development of squamous cell carcinoma in the anus or other affected areas.[65][66] Other stage III chronic sequelae may also include anemia, multi-localized infections, amyloidosis, and arthropathy. Stage III complications have been known to lead to sepsis, but clinical data are still uncertain.\nEndocrine diseases are more common in people who have HS.[67] Diabetes mellitus may be both a causal factor contributing to the evolution and/or severity of HS and a consequence of inflammation in HS.[32][68] Thyroid disorders are also more common in patients with HS.[69]\nHS is a painful and socially isolating condition that leads to a negative impact on mental health as well. A 2020 meta-analysis found that 21% of people with HS have depression, including major depression and 12% have anxiety, including generalized anxiety disorder and a higher risk of suicide.[72][80] A 2020 study found that people with HS have suicide rates more than double the rates in controls, and also have a higher risk of attempting suicide.[81]",
    "Epidemiology": "Estimates of the prevalence of HS vary worldwide, and there is no accepted generalization. In the US, the prevalence is estimated to be 0.1% while in Europe it is thought to be 1% or more.[81]\nIn North America and Europe, women are three times more likely to have HS. However, in South Korea, men are twice as likely to have HS.[81]\nHS is the most prevalent in people in their 40s and 50s.[81]",
    "Society and culture": "HS can have a strong negative impact on people's lives, as well as physical and mental health. People with HS often feel stigmatized and embarrassed by their condition. Many try to hide the symptoms, which can lead to impaired relationships and social isolation. A multidisciplinary approach by healthcare professionals, social support networks, and psychological interventions can contribute to a better quality of life.[37][38]\nCompared to other skin diseases, HS has one of the highest Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores.[95]"

    "Disease": "Hirschsprung%27s disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Typically, Hirschsprung disease is diagnosed shortly after birth, although it may develop well into adulthood,  because of the presence of megacolon, or because the baby fails to pass the first stool (meconium)[9] within 48 hours of delivery.  Normally, 90% of babies pass their first meconium within 24 hours, and 99% within 48 hours.[10]\nSome other signs and symptoms in newborns include a swollen belly, vomiting (green or brown vomit), and flatulence. In older children, some other signs and symptoms include chronic constipation, flatulence, swollen belly, fatigue, and failure to thrive.[11]\nOther symptoms include symptoms of bowel perforation such as vomiting, constipation, poor feeding, lethargy, and diarrhea. Symptoms of bowel obstruction would include vomiting of bile and abdominal distension. Those who do not pass stools after 36 to 48 hours after birth should raise suspicion of Hirschsprung disease. Such suspicion can also be risen if there is only passage of stools after suppository, rectal exam, or enema. Children who do not respond to constipation treatment for six months should also raise suspicion of such disease. Enterocolitis, an acute complication of Hirschsprung disease, is characterised by sudden onset of fever, abdominal distension, vomiting, passage of bloody stools or release of explosive gas or stools after rectal examination.[12]\nSome cases are diagnosed later, into childhood, but usually before age 10.[9] The child may experience fecal retention, constipation, or abdominal distention.[9]\nHirschsprung's disease can also present as part of multi system disorders, such as:[13]",
    "Causes": "The disorder may occur by itself or in association with other genetic disorders such as Down syndrome.[2] About half of isolated cases are linked to a specific genetic mutation and about 20% occur within families.[1] Some of these occur in an autosomal dominant manner.[1] The cause of the remaining cases is unclear.[1] If otherwise normal parents have one child with the condition, the next child has a 4% risk of being affected.[2]\nSeveral genes and specific regions on chromosomes (loci) have been shown or suggested to be associated with Hirschsprung's disease[citation needed]\nThe RET proto-oncogene accounts for the highest proportion of both familial and sporadic cases, with a wide range of mutations scattered along its entire coding region.[20] A proto-oncogene  can cause cancer if it is mutated or overexpressed.[21]\nRET is a gene that codes for proteins that assist cells of the neural crest in their movement through the digestive tract during the development of the embryo.  Those neural crest cells eventually form bundles of nerve cells called ganglions. EDNRB codes for proteins that connect these nerve cells to the digestive tract. Thus, mutations in these two genes could directly lead to the absence of certain nerve fibers in the colon. Research suggests that several genes are associated with Hirschsprung's disease.[22] Also, new research suggests that mutations in genomic sequences involved in regulating EDNRB have a bigger impact on Hirschsprung's disease than previously thought.[citation needed]\nRET can mutate in many ways and is associated with Down syndrome.  Since Down syndrome is comorbid in 2% of Hirschsprung's cases, a likelihood exists that RET is involved heavily in both Hirschsprung's disease and Down syndrome.  RET is also associated with medullary thyroid cancer and neuroblastoma, which is a type of cancer common in children.  Both of these disorders are more common in Hirschsprung's patients than in the general population.  One function that RET controls is the travel of the neural crest cells through the intestines in the developing fetus. The earlier the RET mutation occurs in Hirschsprung's disease, the more severe the disorder becomes.[citation needed]\nCommon and rare DNA variations in the neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and NRG3 (NRG3) were first shown to be associated with the disease in Chinese patients through a Genome Wide Association Study by the Hong Kong team in 2009 [23] and 2012, respectively[24] Subsequent studies in both Asian and Caucasian patients confirmed the initial findings by the University of Hong Kong. Both rare and common variants in these two genes have been identified in additional Chinese,[25] Thai, Korean, Indonesian, and Spanish patients. These two genes are known to play a role in the formation of the enteric nervous system; thus, they are likely to be involved in the pathology of Hirschsprung's disease, at least in some cases.[citation needed]\nAnother gene associated with this condition is NADPH oxidase, EF-hand calcium binding domain 5 (NOX5).[26] This gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 15 (15q23).[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "Definitive diagnosis is made by suction biopsy of the distally narrowed segment.[30] A histologic examination of the tissue would show a lack of ganglionic nerve cells. Diagnostic techniques involve anorectal manometry,[31] barium enema, and rectal biopsy. The suction rectal biopsy is considered the current international gold standard in the diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease.[32]\nRadiologic findings may also assist with diagnosis.[33] An abdominal x-ray can reveal a lack of stool in the large intestine or a bulging caused by blocked stool.[34] Cineanography (fluoroscopy of contrast medium passing anorectal region) assists in determining the level of the affected intestines.[35]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment of Hirschsprung's disease consists of surgical removal (resection) of the abnormal section of the colon, followed by reanastomosis.[citation needed]\nThe first stage of treatment used to be a reversible colostomy.  In this approach, the healthy end of the large intestine is cut and attached to an opening created on the front of the abdomen. The contents of the bowel are discharged through the hole in the abdomen and into a bag.  Later, when the patient's weight, age, and condition are right, the \"new\" functional end of the bowel is connected with the anus. The first surgical treatment involving surgical resection followed by reanastomosis without a colostomy occurred as early as 1933 by Doctor Baird in Birmingham on a one-year-old boy.[citation needed]\nThe Swedish-American surgeon Orvar Swenson (1909–2012), who discovered the cause of Hirschsprung's, first performed its surgical treatment, the pull-through surgery, in 1948.[36] The pull-through procedure repairs the colon by connecting the functioning portion of the bowel to the anus. The pull-through procedure is the typical method for treating Hirschsprung's in younger patients. Swenson devised the original procedure, and the pull-through surgery has been modified many times.[37]'\nCurrently,  several different surgical approaches are used, which include the Swenson, Soave, Duhamel, and Boley procedures.[37] The Swenson procedure leaves a small portion of the diseased bowel. The Soave procedure, named after the Italian pediatric surgeon, Franco Soave [it] (1917–1984), leaves the outer wall of the colon unaltered. The Boley procedure, pioneered by the American surgeon, Scott Boley (born 1941), is a small modification of the Soave procedure, so the term \"Soave-Boley\" procedure is sometimes used.[38][39]  The Duhamel procedure, named for the French pediatric surgeon Bernard Duhamel (1917–1996), uses a surgical stapler to connect the good and bad bowel.[citation needed]\nFor the 15% of children who do not obtain full bowel control, other treatments are available. Constipation may be remedied by laxatives or a high-fiber diet. In those patients, serious dehydration can play a major factor in their lifestyles. A lack of bowel control may be addressed by an ileostomy – similar to a colostomy, but uses the end of the small intestine rather than the colon. The Malone antegrade colonic enema (ACE) is also an option.[40] In a Malone ACE, a tube goes through the abdominal wall to the appendix, or if available, to the colon. The bowel is then flushed daily.[41] Children as young as 6 years of age may administer this daily flush on their own.[citation needed]\nIf the affected portion of the lower intestine is restricted to the lower portion of the rectum, other surgical procedures may be performed, such as a posterior rectal myectomy. The prognosis is good in 70% of cases. Chronic postoperative constipation is present in 7 to 8% of the operated cases. Postoperative enterocolitis, a severe manifestation, is present in the 10–20% of operated patients.[citation needed]",
    "Epidemiology": "According to a 1984 study conducted in Maryland, Hirschsprung's disease appears in 18.6 per 100,000 live births.[42]  In Japan, it occurs at a similar rate of about one in 5,000 births (20 per 100,000).[43] It is more common in male than female (4.32:1) and in white rather than nonwhite.[44]  Nine percent of the Hirschsprung cases were also diagnosed as having Down syndrome.[42] Most cases are diagnosed before the patient is 10 years of age.[9]"

    "Disease": "HNRNPH2-related disorders",
    "Signs and symptoms": "HNRNPH2-related disorders typically manifest in children before the age of 12 months. Symptoms are abnormally slow development, especially in the area of motor development. After the first year the majority of children with these disorders show either nonverbal or minimally verbal speech disorders.[1]\nMany caregivers will notice problems with feeding and report abnormal weight issues and a failure to thrive with continuing gastrointestinal issues such as chronic constipation, poor appetite and difficulty swallowing.[1]\nMany children develop orthopedic issues such as scoliosis and hip dysplasia, and nearly all children have hypotonia (decreased muscle tone) leading to difficulties in walking and other forms of movement.[1]\nNearly three quarters of children have vision problems, with a majority of these reporting strabismus (crossed eyes), and many patients have sensory processing disorders and other sensory issues.[1]\nAlmost half of individuals with HNRNPH2-related disorders have suffered seizures, with the earliest reported first-seizure at the age of three, and the latest first-seizure at the age of thirty-four.[1]",

    "Disease": "Hydranencephaly",
    "Signs and symptoms": "An infant with hydranencephaly may appear normal at birth or may have some distortion of the skull and upper facial features due to fluid pressure inside the skull. The infant's head size and spontaneous reflexes such as sucking, swallowing, crying, and moving the arms and legs may all seem normal, depending on the severity of the condition. However, after a few weeks the infant sometimes becomes irritable and has increased muscle tone (hypertonia). After several months of life, seizures and hydrocephalus may develop, if they did not exist at birth. Other symptoms may include visual impairment, lack of growth, deafness, blindness, spastic quadriparesis (paralysis), and intellectual deficits.[6]\nSome infants may have additional abnormalities at birth including seizures, myoclonus (involuntary sudden, rapid jerks), limited thermoregulation abilities, and respiratory problems. Still other infants display no obvious symptoms at birth, going many months without a confirmed diagnosis of hydranencephaly. In some cases severe hydrocephalus, or another cephalic condition, is misdiagnosed.[7][8]",
    "Causes": "Hydranencephaly is an extreme form of porencephaly, which is characterized by a cyst or cavity in the cerebral hemispheres.[9][10]\nAlthough the exact cause of hydranencephaly remains undetermined in most cases, the most likely general cause is by vascular insult, such as stroke, injury, intrauterine infections, or traumatic disorders after the first trimester of pregnancy. In a number of cases where intrauterine infection was determined to be the causative factor, most involved toxoplasmosis and viral infections such as enterovirus, adenovirus, parvovirus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, Epstein-Barr, and syncytial viruses. Another cause factor is monochorionic twin pregnancies, involving the death of one twin in the second trimester, which in turn causes vascular exchange to the living twin through placental circulation through twin-to-twin transfusion, causing hydranencephaly in the surviving fetus.[11] One medical journal reports hydranencephaly as an autosomal inherited disorder with an unknown mode of transmission, causing a blockage of the carotid artery where it enters the cranium; this causes obstruction and damage to the cerebral cortex.[3]\nThough hydranencephaly is typically a congenital disorder, it can occur as a postnatal diagnosis in the aftermath of meningitis, intracerebral infarction, ischemia, or a traumatic brain injury.[12]",
    "Diagnosis": "An accurate, confirmed diagnosis is generally impossible until after birth, though prenatal diagnosis using fetal ultrasonography (ultrasound) can identify characteristic physical abnormalities. After birth, diagnosis may be delayed for several months because the infant's early behavior appears to be relatively normal.  The most accurate diagnostic techniques are thorough clinical evaluation (considering physical findings and a detailed patient history); advanced imaging techniques, such as angiography, computerized tomography (CT scan), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); and (more rarely) transillumination.[3] However, diagnostic literature fails to provide a clear distinction between severe obstructive hydrocephalus and hydranencephaly, leaving some children with an unsettled diagnosis.[12]\nPreliminary diagnosis may be made in utero via standard ultrasound, and can be confirmed with a standard anatomy ultrasound. Hydranencephaly is sometimes misdiagnosed as bilaterally symmetric schizencephaly (a less destructive developmental process on the brain), severe hydrocephalus (cerebrospinal fluid excess within the skull), or alobar holoprosencephaly (a neurological developmental anomaly).\nOnce destruction of the brain is complete, the cerebellum, midbrain, thalami, basal ganglia, choroid plexus, and portions of the occipital lobes typically remain preserved to varying degrees. The cerebral cortex is absent; however, in most cases, the fetal head remains enlarged due to increased intracranial pressure, which results from inadequate reabsorption of the cerebrospinal fluid produced in the choroid plexus.[11]",
    "Prognosis": "There is no standard treatment for hydranencephaly. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. An accompanying diagnosis of hydrocephalus may be treated with surgical insertion of a shunt; this often improves prognosis and quality of life.[13]\nThe prognosis for children with hydranencephaly is generally quite poor.  Death often occurs within the first year of life,[14] though many children live several years, or even into adulthood; in one reported case, a woman with hydranencephaly was assessed at age 32.[15]"

  {
    "Disease": "Hyperacusis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Hyperacusis symptoms can include an increased perception of the loudness of sounds (loudness hyperacusis), pain (noxacusis/pain hyperacusis/sound-induced otalgia), annoyance, and/or fear in response to sounds by which most people are unaffected. It may affect one or both ears.[12] The majority of patients experience bilateral symptoms but often have one ear that is more affected than the other. Annoyance hyperacusis is often considered synonymous with misophonia. Fear hyperacusis is often considered synonymous with phonophobia. Many researchers more narrowly define hyperacusis to only include loudness hyperacusis and pain hyperacusis.[12]\nHyperacusis can also be accompanied by tinnitus. The latter is more common[13] and there are important differences between their involved mechanisms.[3]\nHyperacusis can result in anxiety and stress. Avoidant behavior is often a response to prevent the effects of hyperacusis and this can include avoiding social situations.[14]\nLoudness hyperacusis is characterized by an increased perception of the loudness of sounds.[12] It is often associated with certain volumes and/or frequencies. It can occur in children[15] and adults,[16] and can be either \"short-term\" in a duration of weeks to less than a year before recovery, or, less commonly, \"long-term,\" spanning years and in some cases becoming permanent. Sensitivity is often different between ears.[17]\nIn some instances, hyperacusis is accompanied by pain, which is known as noxacusis.[18] Noxacusis is characterized by pain resulting from sounds, often initiated at certain volumes or frequencies.[19] Pain can be immediate or delayed, and it sometimes persists for an extended period of time following exposure.[17] Pain can be acute or chronic, and is often described as stabbing, burning, throbbing, or aching. In healthy listeners, pain from sound is not typically experienced until the volume exceeds approximately 120 decibels.[12]\nIndividuals experiencing noxacusis report less improvement over time and fewer benefits from sound therapy compared to individuals with loudness hyperacusis.[20]\nThe threshold of sound at which discomfort is initially experienced; measured in decibels (dB).[21] These tests may cause a setback.[22]\nA setback is a temporary exacerbation of symptoms, a worsening of the perception of loudness or pain from sound, often due to a particular noise exposure.[12] Setback prevention is an important focus among those affected. Efforts to avoid setbacks commonly include using hearing protection and avoiding loud noises.[17] Pain hyperacusis patients experience setbacks more frequently than patients with loudness hyperacusis.[12]\nSome conditions that are associated with hyperacusis include:[23][24]",
    "Causes": "The most common cause of hyperacusis is overexposure to excessively high decibel (sound pressure) levels, which can cause acoustic trauma.[1] An acoustic shock, which can lead to symptoms such as hyperacusis and ear pain, can also occur after exposure to an unexpected moderately loud to loud noise, even if this does not necessarily result in permanent cochlear damage.[7]\nSome affected people acquire hyperacusis suddenly as a result of taking ototoxic drugs (which can damage the cells responsible for hearing), Lyme disease, Ménière's disease, head injury, or surgery. Others are born with sound sensitivity or develop superior canal dehiscence syndrome.[33] Bell's palsy can trigger hyperacusis if the associated flaccid paralysis affects the tensor tympani, and stapedius, two small muscles of the middle ear.[34] Paralysis of the stapedius muscle prevents its function in dampening the oscillations of the ossicles, causing sound to be abnormally loud on the affected side.[35] Age may also be a significant factor, with younger patients exhibiting more severe hyperacusis.[11]\nRecently, it has been discovered that individuals with one copy of the GJB2 (Cx26) genetic mutation exhibit hearing that is more sensitive than average, akin to hyperacusis. These individuals appear to be at greater risk for damage from noise.[36]\nSome psychoactive drugs such as LSD, methaqualone, benzodiazepines, or phencyclidine can cause hyperacusis.[11][37] An antibiotic, ciprofloxacin, has also been seen to be a cause, known as ciprofloxacin-related hyperacusis.[38] Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome is also a possible cause.[39][40]",
    "Diagnosis": "The basic diagnostic test is similar to a normal audiogram. The difference is that, in addition to the hearing threshold at each test frequency, the lowest uncomfortable sound level is also measured. This level is called loudness discomfort level (LDL) or uncomfortable loudness level (ULL). In patients with hyperacusis this level is often considerably lower than in normal subjects, and usually across most parts of the auditory spectrum.[1][42] However, there is not a consensus regarding what constitutes a normal LDL. The relationship between LDL's and self-reported ability to tolerate sounds in everyday life in unclear.[43]\nIn addition to self-report questionnaires, audiologists may employ a variety of other techniques to evaluate auditory function in patients experiencing noise sensitivity. When conducting testing that involves the presentation of sounds, which may cause the patient discomfort or pain, it is vital to inform the patient of the volume and duration of sounds to be presented prior to testing. Care should be taken to begin with sounds of low volume, and volume should be increased gradually. The audiologist and patient should both be prepared to stop testing at any time, depending on the patient's symptoms.[43]",
    "Treatment": "There are currently no evidence-based guidelines regarding the treatment of patients with hyperacusis. The majority of audiologists report insufficient formal education in this area, likely due in part to the current lack of consensus in the literature regarding definitions and treatment of hyperacusis.[44] Dr. Kelly Jahn surveyed 32 patients[45] with severe pain hyperacusis and found that 95% of them had experienced a lack of empathy or support from doctors (20% somewhat agree and 75% strongly agree, with a 5% non response rate).[46]\nSetback prevention and reduction of pain symptoms are high priorities among those with hyperacusis and noxacusis, which is often managed through a combination of controlling the environment so as to avoid loud sounds, soundproofing, and wearing hearing protection, such as earplugs and safety earmuffs.[47][48] Preliminary research has shown that individuals with pain hyperacusis can experience an exacerbation of their symptoms when not adequately protecting themselves against loud sounds.[17]\nThere are diametrically opposing views on avoiding overuse of hearing protection and silence. Some audiologists may advise against using hearing protection in normal sound environments, claiming it can cause or worsen hyperacusis. This is based on a study in healthy volunteers and not individuals with preexisting loudness or pain hyperacusis.[49]\nSound therapy is sometimes recommended for those with hyperacusis, though there is limited evidence supporting its use.[50] Its application among those with pain (noxacusis) should be used with caution. Tinnitus retraining therapy, a treatment originally used to treat tinnitus, uses broadband noise to treat hyperacusis. Pink noise can also be used to treat hyperacusis. By listening to broadband noise at soft levels for a disciplined period of time each day, some patients can rebuild (i.e., re-establish) their tolerances to sound.[2][51][52][53] More research is needed on the efficacy of sound therapy techniques when hyperacusis is the primary complaint, rather than a secondary symptom, indicating that \"no strong conclusions can be made\" about its efficacy at this time.[15] Importantly, individuals with pain hyperacusis are more likely than individuals with loudness hyperacusis to report worsening of their condition after the use of sound therapy.[20]\nAnother possible treatment is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which may also be combined with sound therapy.[23][54] However, randomized controlled trials with active control groups are still needed to establish the effectiveness of CBT for hyperacusis[55] and the usefulness of CBT for noxacusis is not yet demonstrated in the scientific literature.\nStudies have shown improved loudness discomfort levels in patients with hyperacusis after round and oval window reinforcement.[15]\nA case of chronic ear pain associated with hyperacusis after exposure to loud noise at a concert was successfully treated with tympanic neurectomy.[56]\nThe tricyclic anti-depressant clomipramine (brand name Anafranil) has been anecdotally useful for many people with hyperacusis. Both loudness hyperacusis and noxacusis have been successfully treated with this drug.  A dosage of up to 200–250 mg daily for a sustained period of six to twelve months may be needed to cure hyperacusis.  A possible mechanism of action of this drug is that clomipramine reduces reactions of the autonomic nervous system to sounds.[57]\nThe drug ambroxol helps relieve the pain experienced by several pain hyperacusis patients.[medical citation needed]\nSuicidal ideations are a risk factor in hyperacusis patients. Aazh and Moore (2018) interviewed 402 patients and 13% had indicated suicidal or self-harm ideations in the past 2 weeks.[58] Hashir et al. (2019) subsequently interviewed 292 patients and found that 15.75% had expressed suicidal ideations in the previous two weeks of the study. They recommend screening for these issues.[59] Jemma Rosewater suggests that patients are caught in a cycle where family and doctors encourage noise exposure, which causes increased pain and long-term worsening, and patients blame themselves for their \"emotional problem.\"[60] As psychiatric hospitals are noisy and can not make noise accommodations, ultimately hyperacusis patients may become worse instead of improving there.[60]",
    "Epidemiology": "Prevalence estimates for hyperacusis vary widely in the literature, and further epidemiological data is needed. No gender differences have yet been established among hyperacusis patients. Hyperacusis appears to be more severe in younger patients.[11]"

    "Disease": "Hypertrichosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The primary characteristic of all forms of hypertrichosis is excessive hair. Hair in hypertrichosis is usually longer than expected[7] and may consist of any hair type (lanugo, vellus, or terminal).[18] Patterned forms of hypertrichosis cause hair growth in patterns. Generalized forms of hypertrichosis result in hair growth over the entire body. Circumscribed and localized forms lead to hair growth restricted to a certain area.[citation needed]",
    "Causes": "Acquired hypertrichosis lanuginosa is commonly present with cancer.[23] This condition is also linked to metabolic disorders, such as anorexia, hormone imbalances, such as hyperthyroidism, or as a side effect of certain drugs.[23]\nAcquired generalized hypertrichosis may be caused by cancer. The resulting hair growth is known as malignant down. The mechanism behind cancer induced hypertrichosis is unknown.[3] Oral and topical Minoxidil treatments are also known to cause acquired generalized hypertrichosis.[14]\nSeveral medications can cause generalized or localized acquired hypertrichosis including:\nAcquired hypertrichosis is usually reversible once the causative medications are discontinued.\nThe exact genetic mutation that causes congenital circumscribed, localized, and nevoid hypertrichosis is unknown.[1]",
    "Diagnosis": "Hypertrichosis is diagnosed clinically by the occurrence of hair in excess of what is expected for age, sex, and ethnicity in areas that are not androgen-sensitive.[7]  The excess can be in the form of excessive length or density and may consist of any hair type (lanugo, vellus, or terminal).[18]",
    "Epidemiology": "Congenital forms of hypertrichosis are extremely rare. Only 50 cases of congenital hypertrichosis lanuginosa have been recorded since the Middle Ages,[3] and fewer than 100 cases of congenital generalized hypertrichosis have been documented in scientific publications and by the media.[22] Congenital generalized hypertrichosis is isolated to one family in Mexico.[1] Acquired hypertrichosis and hirsutism are more common.[4][27] For example, hirsutism occurs in about 10% of women between ages 18 and 45.[27]",
    "Society and culture": "People with hair often found jobs as circus performers, making the best of their unusual appearance. Fedor Jeftichew (\"Jo-Jo the Dog-faced Man\"), Stephan Bibrowski (\"Lionel the Lion-faced Man\"), Jesús \"Chuy\" Aceves (\"Wolfman\"), Annie Jones (\"the bearded woman\") and Alice Elizabeth Doherty (\"The Minnesota Woolly Girl\") all had hypertrichosis.[8] Extensive hypertrichosis carries an emotional burden and can cause cosmetic embarrassment; however, some people attempt no treatments because they say it defines who they are.[2][28]"

    "Signs and symptoms": "Individuals affected by this disorder appear normal at birth. As the infant grows, however, their arms and legs do not develop properly, and their body becomes thicker and shorter than normal.[3] The following are characteristics consistent with this condition:[1]",
    "Causes": "Hypochondroplasia is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait affecting the FGFR3 gene on chromosome 4p16.3. There is currently no cure for this condition.[2]",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of this condition can be done via X-rays (with lack of normal distance L1 to L5),[9] and additionally genetic testing is available to ascertain hypochondroplasia.[10] However, the physical characteristics are one of the most important in determining the condition.[3]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment of hypochondroplasia usually takes the form of orthopedic surgery and physical therapy. Genetic counseling is advised for individuals and their families. Specifically in the case of spinal stenosis, one option is laminectomy.[3][1]",
    "Prognosis": "Life expectancy for individuals with hypochondroplasia is normal; height is about 132–147 centimetres (4 ft 4 in – 4 ft 10 in).[11]"

    "Disease": "Hypokalemic periodic paralysis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Hypokalemic periodic paralysis is a condition that causes episodes of extreme muscle weakness typically beginning in childhood or adolescence. Most often, these episodes involve a temporary inability to move muscles in the arms and legs. Attacks cause severe weakness or paralysis that usually lasts from hours to days. Some people may have episodes almost every day, while others experience them weekly, monthly, or only rarely. Attacks can occur without warning or can be triggered by factors such as rest after exercise, a viral illness, or certain medications. Often, a large, carbohydrate-rich meal or vigorous exercise in the evening can trigger an attack upon waking the following morning. Although affected individuals usually regain their muscle strength between attacks, some develop persistent muscle weakness later in life.[3]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis can be achieved through a specialized form of electromyographic (EMG) testing called the long exercise test. This test measures the amplitude of a nerve response (called the Compound Muscle Action Potential or CMAP) for 40 to 50 minutes following a few minutes of exercise. In affected patients, there is a progressive fall in the amplitude of the potential. Besides the patient history or a report of serum potassium low normal or low during an attack, the long exercise test is the current standard for medical testing. Genetic diagnosis is often unreliable as only a few of the more common gene locations are tested, but even with more extensive testing 20–37% of people with a clinical diagnosis of hypokalemic periodic paralysis have no known mutation in the two known genes.[9] Standard EMG testing cannot diagnose a patient unless they are in a full blown attack at the time of testing. Provoking an attack with exercise and diet then trying oral potassium can be diagnostic, but also dangerous as this form of PP has an alternate form known as hyperkalemic periodic paralysis. The symptoms are almost the same, but the treatment is different. The old glucose insulin challenge is dangerous and risky to the point of being life-threatening and should never be done when other options are so readily available.[citation needed] Factors known to trigger episodes are: stress, cold environment or hypothermia, carbohydrate load, infection, glucose infusion, metabolic alkalosis, alcohol, strenuous exercise, and steroids.[citation needed]\nPeople with hypokalemic periodic paralysis are often misdiagnosed as having a conversion disorder or hysterical paralysis since the weakness is muscle-based and doesn't correspond to nerve or spinal root distributions. The tendency of people with hypokalemic periodic paralysis to get paralyzed when epinephrine is released in \"fight or flight\" situations further adds to the temptation to misdiagnose the disorder as psychiatric.[10]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment of hypokalemic periodic paralysis focuses on preventing further attacks and relieving acute symptoms. Avoiding carbohydrate-rich meals, strenuous exercise and other identified triggers, and taking acetazolamide or another carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, may help prevent attacks of weakness. Some patients also take potassium-sparing diuretics such as spironolactone to help maintain potassium levels.[11]\nParalysis attacks can be managed by drinking one of various potassium salts dissolved in water (debate exists over which, if any one in particular, is best used, but potassium chloride and bicarbonate are common). Rapidly absorbed boluses of liquid potassium are generally needed to abort an attack, but some patients also find positive maintenance results with time-released potassium tablets. IV potassium is seldom justified unless the patient is unable to swallow. Daily potassium dosage may need to be much higher than for potassium replacement from simple hypokalemia: 100-150 mEqs of potassium is often needed to manage daily fluctuations in muscle strength and function.[citation needed]\nPerioperatively, prevention includes avoiding neuromuscular blockade, avoid excessive hyperventilation, warm the patient, provide adequate hydration, avoid glucose infusions, do not give diuretics, and closely monitor the electrocardiogram for signs of hypokalemia. Normal saline is the preferred IV solution for patients with familial hypokalemic periodic paralysis. Glucose containing solutions may cause weakness. Additionally, the high chloride content can cause a mild acidosis which would be preferred over alkalosis.[citation needed]",
    "Prognosis": "The prognosis for periodic paralysis varies. Overactivity, a diet that is not low in sodium and carbohydrates, or simply an unfortunate gene mutation can lead to a type of chronic, low level weakness called an \"abortive attack,\" or to permanent muscle damage. Abortive attacks often respond to extra potassium, cutting carbohydrates, getting plenty of rest, increasing doses of medication and gentle daily exercise such as short walks. Permanent muscle weakness is just what it sounds like: Permanent, irreparable damage to the muscles and associated weakness. Vacuoles and tubular aggregates form in and destroy healthy muscle tissue. This type of damage can typically be observed via a muscle biopsy. Not even anabolic steroids can repair this type of muscular damage.[citation needed]\nLife span is expected to be normal,[12] but attacks can drop potassium to levels low enough to cause life-threatening breathing problems or heart arrhythmia. Patients often report muscle pain and cognitive problems during attacks. Migraines occur in up to 50% of all hypokalemic periodic paralysis patients and may include less common symptoms like phantom smells, sensitivity to light and sound or loss of words. Medical literatures states that muscle strength is normal between attacks, but patients often report that their baseline strength is in fact lower than that of healthy individuals.[citation needed]\nBecause there are dozens of possible gene mutations, some drugs and treatments that work fine for one patient will not work for another. For example, most patients do well on acetazolamide, but some do not. Some patients will do well with extra magnesium (the body's natural ion channel blocker) or fish oil, while these same nutrients will make other patients worse. Patients and caregivers should take extreme caution with all new drugs and treatment plans.[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "Hypoparathyroidism",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The main symptoms of hypoparathyroidism are the result of the low blood calcium level, which interferes with normal muscle contraction and nerve conduction. As a result, people with hypoparathyroidism can experience paresthesia, an unpleasant tingling sensation around the mouth and in the hands and feet, as well as muscle cramps and severe spasms known as \"tetany\" that affect the hands and feet.[3] Many also report a number of subjective symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, bone pain and insomnia.[1] Crampy abdominal pain may occur.[4] Physical examination of someone with hypocalcemia may show tetany, but it is also possible to provoke tetany of the facial muscles by tapping on the facial nerve (a phenomenon known as Chvostek's sign) or by using the cuff of a sphygmomanometer to temporarily obstruct the blood flow to the arm (a phenomenon known as Trousseau's sign of latent tetany).[4]\nSeveral medical emergencies can arise in people with low calcium levels. These are seizures, severe irregularities in the normal heart beat (specifically prolongation of the QT interval), as well as spasm of the upper part of the airways or the smaller airways known as the bronchi (both potentially causing respiratory failure).[1][5]",
    "Causes": "Hypoparathyroidism can have the following causes:[1]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is by measurement of calcium, serum albumin (for correction), and PTH in blood. If necessary, measuring cAMP (cyclic AMP) in the urine after an intravenous dose of PTH can help in the distinction between hypoparathyroidism and other causes.[citation needed]\nDifferential diagnoses are:\nOther tests include ECG for abnormal heart rhythms, and measurement of blood magnesium levels.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Severe hypocalcaemia, a potentially life-threatening condition,  is treated as soon as possible with intravenous calcium (e.g., as calcium gluconate). Calcium gluconate can be given via a peripheral IV; however, other calcium formulations require infusion via a central venous catheter as the calcium can irritate peripheral veins and cause phlebitis.[5] Precautions are taken to prevent seizures or larynx spasms. The heart is monitored for abnormal rhythms during IV treatment, as calcium may affect cardiac conduction.[5] When the life-threatening attack has been controlled, the person is then transitioned to long-term therapy with oral or subcutaneous injection medications.[5]\nLong-term treatment of hypoparathyroidism is with vitamin D analogs (such as calcitriol or alfacalcidol), vitamin D supplementation and calcium supplementation.[5] Potential risks of treatment for hypoparathyroidism include hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria (elevated calcium in the urine) which may lead to kidney calcification (nephrocalcinosis) and chronic kidney disease.[5][8] Calcium levels in the blood and urine (along with other electrolytes) must be monitored during long-term treatment of hypoparathyroidism and blood calcium levels are intentionally kept at the lower limits of normal, or mildly low, specifically to avoid hypercalciuria, kidney calcification and kidney damage.[5]\nRecombinant human parathyroid hormone and teriparatide (which consists of the first N-terminal 34 amino acids of parathyroid hormone, the bioactive portion of the hormone)(PTH 1-34) may be used as a second line therapy in those that have not responded to conventional therapy.[5] Both medications may be given via subcutaneous injections, but the use of pump delivery of synthetic PTH 1-34 provides the closest approach to physiologic PTH replacement therapy.[9] Recombinant human parathyroid hormone and teriparatide are also associated with a risk of hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria with associated kidney calcification and kidney damage.[5] If these medications are discontinued, they should be tapered, and calcium levels should be closely monitored, as the transient PTH depletion after stopping the medications can lead to bone leaching of calcium as a compensatory mechanism to increase calcium levels.[5]\nA 2019 systematic review has highlighted that, because of the research gap in recent rigorous studies, there is a lack of high-quality evidence for the use of vitamin D, calcium, or recombinant parathyroid hormone in the management of both temporary and long-term hypoparathyroidism following thyroidectomy.[10]\nKidney ultrasound may be considered periodically to assess for any nephrocalcinosis for those on long-term therapy for hypoparathyroidism.[5]"

    "Disease": "Hypophosphatasia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "There is a remarkable variety of symptoms that depends, largely, on the age of the patient at initial presentation, ranging from death in utero to relatively mild bone problems with or without dentition symptoms[10] in adult life although neurological and extra-skeletal symptoms are also reported.[11] The stages of this disease are generally included in the following categories: perinatal, infantile, childhood, adult, benign prenatal and odontohypophosphatasia.[12] Although several clinical sub-types of the disease have been characterized, based on the age at which skeletal lesions are discovered, the disease is best understood as a single continuous spectrum of severity.[citation needed]\nAs the presentation of adult disease is highly variable, incorrect or missed diagnosis may occur.[10] In one study, 19% of patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia had laboratory findings suggestive of possible hypophosphatasia.[13]\nOne case report details a 35-year old female with low serum ALP and mild pains but no history of rickets, fractures or dental problems. Subsequent evaluation showed osteopenia and renal microcalcifications and an elevation of PEA. The genetic mutations found in this case were previously reported in perinatal, infantile and childhood hypophosphatasia, but not adult hypophosphatasia.[10]\nPerinatal hypophosphatasia is the most lethal form. Profound hypomineralization results in caput membranaceum (a soft calvarium), deformed or shortened limbs during gestation and at birth, and rapid death due to respiratory failure.[14] Stillbirth is not uncommon and long-term survival is rare. Neonates who manage to survive suffer increasing respiratory compromise due to softening of the bones (osteomalacia) and underdeveloped lungs (hypoplastic). Ultimately, this leads to respiratory failure. Epilepsy (seizures) can occur and can prove lethal.[15] Regions of developing, unmineralized bone (osteoid) may expand and encroach on the marrow space, resulting in myelophthisic anemia.[16][17]\nIn radiographic examinations, perinatal hypophosphatasia can be distinguished from even the most severe forms of osteogenesis imperfecta and congenital dwarfism. Some stillborn skeletons show almost no mineralization; others have marked undermineralization and severe osteomalacia. Occasionally, there can be a complete absence of ossification in one or more vertebrae. In the skull, individual bones may calcify only at their centers. Another unusual radiographic feature is bony spurs that protrude laterally from the shafts of the ulnae and fibulae. Despite the considerable patient-to-patient variability and the diversity of radiographic findings, the X-ray can be considered diagnostic.[citation needed]\nInfantile hypophosphatasia presents in the first 6 months of life, with the onset of poor feeding and inadequate weight gain. Clinical manifestations of rickets often appear at this time. Although cranial sutures appear to be wide, this reflects hypomineralization of the skull, and there is often \"functional\" craniosynostosis. If the patient survives infancy, these sutures can permanently fuse. Defects in the chest, such as flail chest resulting from rib fractures, lead to respiratory compromise and pneumonia. Elevated calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia) and urine (hypercalciuria) are also common, and may explain the renal problems and recurrent vomiting seen in this disease.[18]\nRadiographic features in infants are generally less severe than those seen in perinatal hypophosphatasia. In the long bones, there is an abrupt change from a normal appearance in the shaft (diaphysis) to uncalcified regions near the ends (metaphysis), which suggests the occurrence of an abrupt metabolic change. In addition, serial radiography studies suggest that defects in skeletal mineralization (i.e. rickets) persist and become more generalized. Mortality is estimated to be 50% in the first year of life.[19]\nHypophosphatasia in childhood has variable clinical expression. As a result of defects in the development of the dental cementum, the deciduous teeth (baby teeth) are often lost before the age of 5. Frequently, the incisors are lost first; occasionally all of the teeth are lost prematurely. Dental radiographs can show the enlarged pulp chambers and root canals that are characteristic of rickets.[20]\nPatients may experience delayed walking, a characteristic waddling gait, stiffness and pain, and muscle weakness (especially in the thighs) consistent with nonprogressive myopathy. Typically, radiographs show defects in calcification and characteristic bony defects near the ends of major long bones. Growth retardation, frequent fractures, and low bone density (osteopenia) are common. In severely-affected infants and young children, cranial bones can fuse prematurely, despite the appearance of open fontanels on radiographic studies. The illusion of open fontanels results from hypomineralization of large areas of the calvarium. Premature bony fusion of the cranial sutures may elevate intracranial pressure.[21]\nAdult hypophosphatasia can be associated with rickets, premature loss of deciduous teeth, or early loss of adult dentation followed by relatively good health. Osteomalacia results in painful feet due to poor healing of metatarsal stress fractures. Discomfort in the thighs or hips due to femoral pseudofractures can be distinguished from other types of osteomalacia by their location in the lateral cortices of the femora.[22] The symptoms of this disease usually begin during middle age of an adult patient and can include bone pain, and hypomineralization.[23][12]\nSome patients suffer from calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal depositions with occasional attacks of arthritis (pseudogout), which appears to be the result of elevated endogenous inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) levels. These patients may also suffer articular cartilage degeneration and pyrophosphate arthropathy. Radiographs reveal pseudofractures in the lateral cortices of the proximal femora and stress fractures, and patients may experience osteopenia, chondrocalcinosis, features of pyrophosphate arthropathy, and calcific periarthritis.[22]\nOdontohypophosphatasia is present when dental disease is the only clinical abnormality, and radiographic and/or histologic studies reveal no evidence of rickets or osteomalacia. Although hereditary leukocyte abnormalities and other disorders usually account for this condition, odontohypophosphatasia may explain some \"early-onset periodontitis\" cases.[citation needed]",
    "Causes": "Hypophosphatasia is associated with a molecular defect in the gene encoding tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP). TNSALP is an enzyme that is tethered to the outer surface of osteoblasts and chondrocytes. TNSALP hydrolyzes several substances, including mineralization-inhibiting inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) and pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP), a major form of vitamin B.  A relationship describing physiologic regulation of mineralization has been termed the Stenciling Principle of mineralization, whereby enzyme-substrate pairs imprint mineralization patterns locally into the extracellular matrix (most notably described for bone) by degrading mineralization inhibitors (e.g. TNAP/TNSALP/ALPL enzyme degrading the pyrophosphate inhibition of mineralization, and PHEX enzyme degrading the osteopontin inhibition of mineralization).[24][25] The Stenciling Principle for mineralization is particularly relevant to the osteomalacia and odontomalacia observed in hypophosphatasia (HPP) and X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH).[25]6.\nWhen TSNALP enzymatic activity is low, inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) accumulates outside of cells in the extracellular matrix of bones and teeth, and inhibits formation of hydroxyapatite mineral, the main hardening component of bone, causing rickets in infants and children and osteomalacia (soft bones) and odontomalacia (soft teeth) in children and adults. PLP is the principal form of vitamin B6 and must be dephosphorylated by TNSALP before it can cross the cell membrane. Vitamin B6 deficiency in the brain impairs synthesis of neurotransmitters, which can cause seizures. In some cases, a build-up of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals in the joint can cause pseudogout.[26]",
    "Diagnosis": "Hypophosphatasia is often discovered because of an early loss of deciduous (baby or primary) teeth with the root intact. Researchers have recently documented a positive correlation between dental abnormalities and clinical phenotype. Poor dentition is also noted in adults.[29]\nThe symptom that best characterizes hypophosphatasia is low serum activity of alkaline phosphatase enzyme (ALP). In general, lower levels of enzyme activity correlate with more severe symptoms. The decrease in ALP activity leads to an increase in pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP), which is the major form of Vitamin B6, in the blood, although tissue levels of Vitamin B6 may be unremarkable[30] and correlates with disease severity.[31] Urinary inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) levels are elevated in most hypophosphatasia patients and, although it remains only a research technique, this increase has been reported to accurately detect carriers of the disease. In addition, most patients have an increased level of urinary phosphoethanolamine (PEA) although some may not.[6] PLP screening is preferred over PEA due to cost and sensitivity.[32]\nTests for serum tissue-non-specific ALP (sometimes referred to as TNSALP) levels are part of the standard comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) that is used in routine exams, although bone-specific ALP testing may be indicative of disease severity.[33]\nDespite patient-to-patient variability and the diversity of radiographic findings, the X-ray is diagnostic in infantile hypophosphatasia.[34] Skeletal defects are found in nearly all patients and include hypomineralization, rachitic changes, incomplete vertebrate ossification and, occasionally, lateral bony spurs on the ulnae and fibulae.[citation needed]\nIn newborns, X-rays readily distinguish hypophosphatasia from osteogenesis imperfecta and congenital dwarfism. Some stillborn skeletons show almost no mineralization; others have marked undermineralization and severe rachitic changes. Occasionally there can be peculiar complete or partial absence of ossification in one or more vertebrae. In the skull, individual membranous bones may calcify only at their centers, making it appear that areas of the unossified calvarium have cranial sutures that are widely separated when, in fact, they are functionally closed. Small protrusions (or \"tongues\") of radiolucency often extend from the metaphyses into the bone shaft.\nIn infants, radiographic features of hypophosphatasia are striking, though generally less severe than those found in perinatal hypophosphatasia. In some newly diagnosed patients, there is an abrupt transition from relatively normal-appearing diaphyses to uncalcified metaphases, suggesting an abrupt metabolic change has occurred. Serial radiography studies can reveal the persistence of impaired skeletal mineralization (i.e. rickets), instances of sclerosis, and gradual generalized demineralization.\nIn adults, X-rays may reveal bilateral femoral pseudofractures in the lateral subtrochanteric diaphysis. These pseudofractures may remain for years, but they may not heal until they break completely or the patient receives intramedullary fixation. These patients may also experience recurrent metatarsal fractures. DXA may show abnormal bone mineral density which may correlate with disease severity, although bone mineral density in HPP patients may not be systemically reduced.[35]\nAll clinical sub-types of hypophosphatasia have been traced to genetic mutations in the gene encoding TNSALP, which is localized on chromosome 1p36.1-34 in humans (ALPL; OMIM#171760). Approximately 388 distinct mutations have been described in the TNSALP gene.[2] \"The Tissue Nonspecific Alkaline Phosphatase Gene Mutations Database\". Archived from the original on 2016-03-04. Retrieved 2009-08-14. About 80% of the mutations are missense mutations. The number and diversity of mutations results in highly variable phenotypic expression, and there appears to be a correlation between genotype and phenotype in hypophosphatasia.[36] Mutation analysis is possible and available in 3 laboratories.[37]",
    "Treatment": "As of October 2015, asfotase alfa (Strensiq) has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of hypophosphatasia.\nSome evidence exists to support the use of teriparatide in adult-HPP.[38][39][40][41]\nCurrent management consists of palliating symptoms, maintaining calcium balance and applying physical, occupational, dental and orthopedic interventions, as necessary.[8]"

    "Disease": "Hypopituitarism",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The hormones of the pituitary have different actions in the body, and the symptoms of hypopituitarism therefore depend on which hormone is deficient. The symptoms may be subtle and are often initially attributed to other causes.[1][6] In most of the cases, three or more hormones are deficient.[7] The most common problem is insufficiency of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and/or luteinizing hormone (LH) leading to sex hormone abnormalities. Growth hormone deficiency is more common in people with an underlying tumor than those with other causes.[1][7]\nSometimes, there are additional symptoms that arise from the underlying cause; for instance, if the hypopituitarism is due to a growth hormone-producing tumor, there may be symptoms of acromegaly (enlargement of the hands and feet, coarse facial features), and if the tumor extends to the optic nerve or optic chiasm, there may be visual field defects. Headaches may also accompany pituitary tumors,[1] as well as pituitary apoplexy (infarction or haemorrhage of a pituitary tumor) and lymphocytic hypophysitis (autoimmune inflammation of the pituitary).[8] Apoplexy, in addition to sudden headaches and rapidly worsening visual loss, may also be associated with double vision that results from compression of the nerves in the adjacent cavernous sinus that control the eye muscles.[9]\nPituitary failure results in many changes in the skin, hair and nails as a result of the absence of pituitary hormone action on these sites.[10]\nSeveral hormone deficiencies associated with hypopituitarism may lead to secondary diseases. For instance, growth hormone deficiency is associated with obesity, raised cholesterol and the metabolic syndrome, and estradiol deficiency may lead to osteoporosis. While effective treatment of the underlying hormone deficiencies may improve these risks, it is often necessary to treat them directly.[6]\nDeficiency of all anterior pituitary hormones is more common than individual hormone deficiency.\nDeficiency of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), together referred to as the gonadotropins, leads to different symptoms in men and women. Women experience oligo- or amenorrhea (infrequent/light or absent menstrual periods respectively) and infertility. Men lose facial, scrotal and trunk hair, as well as have decreased muscle mass and anemia. Both sexes may experience a decrease in libido and loss of sexual function, and have an increased risk of osteoporosis (bone fragility). Lack of LH/FSH in children is associated with delayed puberty.[1][6]\nGrowth hormone (GH) deficiency leads to a decrease in muscle mass, central obesity (increase in body fat around the waist) and impaired attention and memory. Children experience growth retardation and short stature.[1][6]\nAdrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency leads to adrenal insufficiency, a lack of production of glucocorticoids such as cortisol by the adrenal gland. If the problem is chronic, symptoms consist of fatigue, weight loss, failure to thrive (in children), delayed puberty (in adolescents), hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels), anemia and hyponatremia (low sodium levels). If the onset is abrupt, collapse, shock and vomiting may occur.[1][6]  ACTH deficiency is highly similar to primary Addison's disease, which is cortisol deficiency as the result of direct damage to the adrenal glands; the latter form, however, often leads to hyperpigmentation of the skin, which does not occur in ACTH deficiency.[11]\nThyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) deficiency leads to hypothyroidism (lack of production of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) in the thyroid). Typical symptoms are tiredness, intolerance to cold, constipation, weight gain, hair loss and slowed thinking, as well as a slowed heart rate and low blood pressure. In children, hypothyroidism leads to delayed growth and in extreme inborn forms to a syndrome called cretinism.[1][6]\nProlactin (PRL) plays a role in breastfeeding, and inability to breastfeed may point at abnormally low prolactin levels.[8]\nAntidiuretic hormone (ADH) deficiency leads to the syndrome of diabetes insipidus (unrelated to diabetes mellitus): inability to concentrate the urine, leading to polyuria (production of large amounts of clear urine) that is low in solutes, dehydration and—in compensation—extreme thirst and constant need to drink (polydipsia), as well as hypernatremia (high sodium levels in the blood).[12] ADH deficiency may be masked if there is ACTH deficiency, with symptoms only appearing when cortisol has been replaced.[8]\nOxytocin (OXT) deficiency generally causes few symptoms,[1] however may lead to abnormal social developments due to its complex role as a social neuropeptide.[13]",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of hypopituitarism is made on blood tests. Two types of blood tests are used to confirm the presence of a hormone deficiency: basal levels, where blood samples are taken–usually in the morning–without any form of stimulation, and dynamic tests, where blood tests are taken after the injection of a stimulating substance. Measurement of ACTH and growth hormone usually requires dynamic testing, whereas the other hormones (LH/FSH, prolactin, TSH) can typically be tested with basal levels. There is no adequate direct test for ADH levels, but ADH deficiency can be confirmed indirectly; oxytocin levels are not routinely measured.[1]\nGenerally, the finding of a combination of a low pituitary hormone together with a low hormone from the effector gland is indicative of hypopituitarism.[14] Occasionally, the pituitary hormone may be normal but the effector gland hormone decreased; in this case, the pituitary is not responding appropriately to effector hormone changes, and the combination of findings is still suggestive of hypopituitarism.[6]\nLevels of LH/FSH may be suppressed by a raised prolactin level, and are therefore not interpretable unless prolactin is low or normal. In men, the combination of low LH and FSH in combination with a low testosterone confirms LH/FSH deficiency; a high testosterone would indicate a  source elsewhere in the body (such as a testosterone-secreting tumor). In women, the diagnosis of LH/FSH deficiency depends on whether the woman has been through the menopause. Before the menopause, abnormal menstrual periods together with low estradiol and LH/FSH levels confirm a pituitary problem; after the menopause (when LH/FSH levels are normally elevated and the ovaries produce less estradiol), inappropriately low LH/FSH alone is sufficient.[1] Stimulation tests with GnRH are possible, but their use is not encouraged.[6][8]\nFor TSH, basal measurements are usually sufficient, as well as measurements of thyroxine to ensure that the pituitary is not simply suppressing TSH production in response to hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid gland). A stimulation test with thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is not regarded as useful.[8] Prolactin can be measured by basal level, and is required for the interpretation of LH and FSH results in addition to the confirmation of hypopituitarism or diagnosis of a prolactin-secreting tumor.[1]\nGrowth hormone deficiency is almost certain if all other pituitary tests are also abnormal, and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels are decreased. If this is not the case, IGF-1 levels are poorly predictive of the presence of GH deficiency; stimulation testing with the insulin tolerance test is then required. This is performed by administering insulin to lower the blood sugar to a level below 2.2 mmol/L. Once this occurs, growth hormone levels are measured. If they are low despite the stimulatory effect of the low blood sugars, growth hormone deficiency is confirmed. The test is not without risks, especially in those prone to seizures or are known to have heart disease, and causes the unpleasant symptoms of hypoglycemia.[1][6] Alternative tests (such as the growth hormone releasing hormone stimulation test) are less useful, although a stimulation test with arginine may be used for diagnosis, especially in situations where an insulin tolerance test is thought to be too dangerous.[20] If GH deficiency is suspected, and all other pituitary hormones are normal, two different stimulation tests are needed for confirmation.[8]\nIf morning cortisol levels are over 500 nmol/L, ACTH deficiency is unlikely, whereas a level less than 100 is indicative. Levels between 100 and 500 require a stimulation test.[6] This, too, is done with the insulin tolerance test. A cortisol level above 500 after achieving a low blood sugar rules out ACTH deficiency, while lower levels confirm the diagnosis. A similar stimulation test using corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is not sensitive enough for the purposes of the investigation. If the insulin tolerance test yields an abnormal result, a further test measuring the response of the adrenal glands to synthetic ACTH (the ACTH stimulation test) can be performed to confirm the diagnosis.[21] Stimulation testing with metyrapone is an alternative.[21] Some suggest that an ACTH stimulation test is sufficient as first-line investigation, and that an insulin tolerance test is only needed if the ACTH test is equivocal.[6][8] The insulin tolerance test is discouraged in children.[6] None of the tests for ACTH deficiency are perfect, and further tests after a period of time may be needed if initial results are not conclusive.[1]\nSymptoms of diabetes insipidus should prompt a formal fluid deprivation test to assess the body's response to dehydration, which normally causes concentration of the urine and increasing osmolarity of the blood. If these parameters are unchanged, desmopressin (an ADH analogue) is administered. If the urine then becomes concentrated and the blood osmolarity falls, there is a lack of ADH due to lack of pituitary function (\"cranial diabetes insipidus\"). In contrast, there is no change if the kidneys are unresponsive to ADH due to a different problem (\"nephrogenic diabetes insipidus\").[1]\nIf one of these tests shows a deficiency of hormones produced by the pituitary, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the pituitary is the first step in identifying an underlying cause. MRI may show various tumors and may assist in delineating other causes. Tumors smaller than 1 cm are referred to as microadenomas, and larger lesions are called macroadenomas.[1] Computed tomography with radiocontrast may be used if MRI is not available.[8] Formal visual field testing by perimetry is recommended, as this would show evidence of optic nerve compression by a tumor.[8]\nOther tests that may assist in the diagnosis of hypopituitarism, especially if no tumor is found on the MRI scan, are ferritin (elevated in hemochromatosis), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels (often elevated in sarcoidosis), and human chorionic gonadotropin (often elevated in tumor of germ cell origin). If a genetic cause is suspected, genetic testing may be performed.[8]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment of hypopituitarism is threefold: removing the underlying cause, treating the hormone deficiencies, and addressing any other repercussions that arise from the hormone deficiencies.[1]",
    "Prognosis": "Several studies have shown that hypopituitarism is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and some also an increased risk of death of about 50% to 150% the normal population.[6][14] It has been difficult to establish which hormone deficiency is responsible for this risk, as almost all patients studied had growth hormone deficiency.[8] The studies also do not answer the question as to whether the hypopituitarism itself causes the increased mortality, or whether some of the risk is to be attributed to the treatments, some of which (such as sex hormone supplementation) have a recognized adverse effect on cardiovascular risk.[8]\nThe largest study to date followed over a thousand people for eight years; it showed an 87% increased risk of death compared to the normal population. Predictors of higher risk were: female sex, absence of treatment for sex hormone deficiency, younger age at the time of diagnosis, and a diagnosis of craniopharyngioma. Apart from cardiovascular disease, this study also showed an increased risk of death from lung disease.[8][24]\nQuality of life may be significantly reduced, even in those people on optimum medical therapy. Many report both physical and psychological problems. It is likely that the commonly used replacement therapies do not completely mimic the natural hormone levels in the body.[6] Health costs remain about double those of the normal population.[6]\nHypopituitarism is usually permanent. It requires lifelong treatment with one or more medicines.",
    "Epidemiology": "There is only one study that has measured the prevalence (total number of cases in a population) and incidence (annual number of new cases) of hypopituitarism.[1] This study was conducted in Northern Spain and used hospital records in a well-defined population.  The study showed that 45.5 people out of 100,000 had been diagnosed with hypopituitarism, with 4.2 new cases per year.[7] 61% were due to tumors of the pituitary gland, 9% due to other types of lesions, and 19% due to other causes; in 11% no cause could be identified.[1][7]\nRecent studies have shown that people with a previous traumatic brain injury, spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (a type of stroke) or radiation therapy involving the head have a higher risk of hypopituitarism.[25] After traumatic brain injury, as much as a quarter have persistent pituitary hormone deficiencies.[26] Many of these people may have subtle or non-specific symptoms that are not linked to pituitary problems but attributed to their previous condition. It is therefore possible that many cases of hypopituitarism remain undiagnosed, and that the annual incidence would rise to 31 per 100,000 annually if people from these risk groups were to be tested.[1]"

    "Disease": "Hypoplastic left heart syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Closing of the ductus arteriosus in a heart that is severely underdeveloped on the left results in cyanosis and respiratory distress which can progress to cardiogenic shock and death. Early symptoms might include poor feeding or cyanosis that does not respond to oxygen administration. Peripheral pulses may be weak and extremities cool to the touch.[5]\nHLHS often co-occurs with low birth weight and premature birth.[5]\nIn neonates with a small atrial septal defect, termed \"restrictive\", there is inadequate mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. These neonates quickly decompensate and develop acidosis and cyanosis.[5]\nOn EKG, right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy are common, but not indicative of HLHS. Chest x-ray may show a large heart (cardiomegaly) or increased pulmonary vasculature. Neonates with HLHS do not typically have a heart murmur, but in some cases, a pulmonary flow murmur or tricuspid regurgitation murmur may be audible.[5]\nCo-occurring tricuspid regurgitation or right ventricular dysfunction can cause hepatomegaly to develop.[5]",
    "Diagnosis": "Hypoplastic left heart syndrome can be diagnosed prenatally or after birth via echocardiography. Typical findings include a small left ventricle and aorta, abnormalities of the mitral and aortic valves, retrograde flow in the transverse arch of the aorta, and left-to-right flow between the atria. It is often recognized during the second trimester of pregnancy, between 18 and 24 weeks' gestation.[5]\nChest x-ray may also be utilized in the diagnosis of hypoplastic left heart syndrome, and typically shows an enlarged cardiac silhouette along with signs pulmonary hypertension. Blood work and genetic testing remain of high importance as well, and should include a complete blood count, electrolytes, lactate, and arterial blood gas to evaluate acid-base status and oxygenation. Genetic testing may be beneficial to obtain and has been associated with multiple chromosomal abnormalities including Turner, DiGeorge, and Down syndrome.[21]",
    "Treatment": "Without life-prolonging interventions, HLHS is fatal, but with intervention, an infant may survive. A cardiothoracic surgeon may perform a series of operations or a full heart transplant. While surgical intervention has emerged as the standard of care in the United States, other national health systems, notably in France, approach diagnosis of HLHS in a more conservative manner, with an emphasis on termination of pregnancy or compassionate care after delivery.[8]\nBefore surgery, the ductus must be kept open to allow blood-flow using medication containing prostaglandin.[9] Air with less oxygen than normal is used for infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. These low oxygen levels increases the pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and thus improve blood flow to the rest of the body due to the greater pressure difference between the lungs and body.  Achieving oxygen levels below atmosphere requires the use of inhaled nitrogen.[22] Nitric oxide is a potent pulmonary vasodilator, and thus reduces PVR and improves venous return. Any factor that increases PVR will impede right-sided flow.[23][24]\nSurgical operations to assist with hypoplastic left heart are complex and need to be individualized for each patient. A cardiologist must assess all medical and surgical options on a case-by-case basis.[citation needed]\nCurrently, infants undergo either the staged reconstructive surgery (Norwood or Sano procedure within a few days of birth, Glenn or Hemi-Fontan procedure at 3 to 6 months of age, and the Fontan procedure at 1 1/2 to 5 years of age) or cardiac transplantation.[10] Current expectations are that 70% of those with HLHS may reach adulthood.[18] Many studies show that the higher the volume (number of surgeries performed) at a hospital, the lower the mortality (death) rate.[25][26] Factors that increase an infant's risk include lower birth weight, additional congenital anomalies, a genetic syndrome or those with a highly restrictive atrial septum.[27] For patients without these additional risk factors, 5 year survival now approaches 80%.[27]  Studies show that about 75% of those children who survive surgery show developmental delays in one or more areas, such as motor, cognitive, or language impairments, with about a third of single-ventricle children without a genetic syndrome having significant impairments.[28] Current research focuses on charting the connections between neurodevelopment injuries, surgical and intensive care procedures, and genetic susceptibility with the goal of modifying interventions that impair neurodevelopmental and psychosocial outcomes.[29]  An alternative to the traditional Norwood is the Hybrid procedure.[30]\nSome physicians offer compassionate care, instead of the surgeries, which results in the child's death, usually within 2 weeks of birth.  Compassionate care is overseen by a physician, and may be carried out either in the hospital or at home.  However, due to the vast improvement of surgical intervention, with many hospitals achieving over 90% survival, there is debate on whether or not compassionate care should still be offered to families.[31] A study in 2003 concluded that a selection of physicians who are experts in the care of children with HLHS were evenly split when asked what they would do if their own children were born with HLHS, with 1/3 stating that they would choose surgery, 1/3 stating that they would choose palliative (compassionate) treatment without surgery, and 1/3 stating that they are uncertain which choice they would make.[32]\nThe three-stage procedure is a palliative procedure (not a cure), as the child's circulation is made to work with only two of the heart's four chambers.[citation needed]\nThe first step is the Norwood procedure.[33] In this procedure, the right ventricle is used to pump blood into the systemic circulation. Since the right ventricle is no longer directly pumping blood to the lungs, a shunt is required in order to pass deoxygenated blood through the lungs. Either the subclavian artery can be connected to the pulmonary circulation (Blalock-Taussig shunt), or a shunt is made directly from the right ventricle to the pulmonary circulation (Sano shunt). The narrow aorta is enlarged using a patch to improve blood flow to the body.[34]\nDuring this time the baby may be medically fragile and have feeding problems because the heart is working very hard. There is a considerable degree of venous mixing in the right ventricle, leading to lower oxygen saturation. In addition, both the Blalock-Taussig and the Sano shunts expose the lungs to systemic arterial pressures, leading to long-term pulmonary hypertension and, eventually, heart failure.[33]\nThe Hybrid procedure may be used in place of the Norwood.[33][35][36]  The Hybrid procedure does not necessitate the use of heart-lung bypass or performing a sternotomy.  Instead of a six-hour surgery, the Hybrid typically takes one to two hours.  In this procedure, a stent is placed in the ductus arteriosus to maintain its patency, and bands are placed over both the left and right pulmonary artery branches to limit pressure and over-circulation to the lungs.[37]  Outcomes with the Hybrid approach are comparable to those with the Norwood.[38]\nThe second stage—the bidirectional Glenn or Hemi-Fontan (see also Kawashima procedure)—relieves some of the problems introduced by Stage I palliation.[33] In this operation, the superior vena cava is ligated from the heart and connected to the pulmonary circulation. At this time, the Blalock-Taussig or Sano shunt is taken down. The lungs are no longer exposed to systemic arterial pressures, but much lower venous pressures. Although venous blood from the upper half of the body is no longer mixing with oxygenated blood in the right ventricle, there is still venous mixing from the lower half of the body, leading to some degree of oxygen desaturation.[33]\nThe final procedure, the Fontan procedure, completes the repair of the hypoplastic left heart.[33] Although there are several variations, the functional effect is to redirect venous blood from the lower body (through the inferior vena cava) away from the right atrium to the pulmonary artery. This should eliminate any mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in the right ventricle. The right ventricle performs the traditional job of the left, supplying the body with oxygenated blood, while the passive systemic venous pressure performs the traditional job of the right, passing deoxygenated blood to the lungs.[33]\nInterventions performed during fetal development are under investigation. When signs of HLHS are detected prenatally via ultrasound, a percutaneous procedure involving the insertion of a balloon catheter can open the atrial septal defect to prevent left atrial hypertension and promote improved heart development.[39][40]",
    "Prognosis": "95% of untreated infants with HLHS die in the first weeks of life.[5]\nEarly survival has improved since the introduction of the Norwood procedure.[18] Since there are no long-term studies of HLHS adults, statistics are usually derived from post-Fontan patients; it is estimated that 70% of HLHS patients may reach adulthood.[18]\nPrognosis is dependent upon the health of the child, as there is an increased demand on respiratory and heart rate in infants during common childhood illnesses. This fragile population has little cardiac reserve to accommodate these demands and provide hemodynamic stability during illnesses.[41]\nChildren with HLHS and other comparable single-ventricle conditions, as a group, have poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes than their healthy peers. Deficits in language, executive functioning, and higher rates of anxiety and depression disorders have been demonstrated.[42] Some of these outcomes may be a consequence of genetic factors associated with HLHS, and others may be modifiable through changes to procedures and to the healthcare environment. There is an emerging clinical consensus around the importance of continuous neurodevelopmental surveillance from the earliest years into adulthood.[11][43] Additionally, a recent meta-analysis comparing twenty-two studies showed that 64.7% of the studies reported delayed motor development in children with single ventricle physiologies, such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome.[12]\nAs is true for patients with other types of heart defects involving malformed valves,[44]  HLHS patients run a high risk of endocarditis, and must be monitored by a cardiologist for the rest of their lives to check on their heart function.[citation needed]\nHeart transplantation may be indicated, typically after Fontan completion.[18] One multi-center study (of patients undergoing the Fontan from 1993 to 2001) reported a 76% 1-year survival rate in patients who survived to transplant.[45]",
    "Epidemiology": "HLHS occurs in an estimated 1 out of 3,841 live births in the United States, or an estimated total of 1,025 live births per year in the US.[13][14] Overall, it is estimated to make up 2-3% of all cases of congenital heart disease, and is the most common single-ventricle defect.[3] It is thought to be more common in male infants, 1.5 times as common as in female infants.[15] A recent systematic review found a slight decrease in prevalence of HLHS from 0.689/1000 in 1995–1999, to 0.475/1000 in 2010–2017.[3] This is thought to be due to improvements in prenatal detection and prenatal counseling in subsequent pregnancies."

    "Disease": "Hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Hair growth on the head is noticeably less full than normal, and the hairs are very weak; the rest of the body shows normal hair. The macular degeneration comes on slowly with deterioration of central vision, leading to a loss of reading ability. Those affected may otherwise develop in a completely healthy manner; life expectancy is normal.[citation needed]",
    "Causes": "Hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy is an autosomal recessive hereditary disease.[2] It is caused by a combination of mutations (compound heterozygosity) in the CDH3 gene, which codes for Cadherin-3 (also known as P-Cadherin), a calcium-binding protein that is responsible for cellular adhesion in various tissues.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "The markedly anomalous hair growth should lead to a retinal examination by school entry at the latest, since weak vision will not necessarily be detected in the course of normal medical check-ups. Confirmation of a diagnosis, which is necessary for any future therapeutic options, is only possible by means of a molecular genetic diagnosis in the context of genetic counseling.[citation needed]\nThe extent of retinal damage is assessed by fluorescent angiography, retinal scanning and optical coherence tomography; electrophysiological examinations such as electroretinography (ERG) or multifocal electroretinography (mfERG) may also be used.[citation needed]\nAnomalies of the hair shaft caused by ectodermal dysplasia should be ruled out. Mutations in the CDH3 gene can also appear in EEM syndrome.",
    "Treatment": "There is no treatment for the disorder. A number of studies are looking at gene therapy, exon skipping and CRISPR interference to offer hope for the future. Accurate determination through confirmed diagnosis of the genetic mutation that has occurred also offers potential approaches beyond gene replacement for a specific group, namely in the case of diagnosis of a so-called nonsense mutation, a mutation where a stop codon is produced by the changing of a single base in the DNA sequence. This results in premature termination of protein biosynthesis, resulting in a shortened and either functionless or function-impaired protein. In what is sometimes called \"read-through therapy\", translational skipping of the stop codon, resulting in a functional protein, can be induced by the introduction of specific substances. However, this approach is only conceivable in the case of narrowly circumscribed mutations, which cause differing diseases.[citation needed]\nA disease that threatens the eyesight and additionally produces a hair anomaly that is apparent to strangers causes harm beyond the physical. It is therefore not surprising that learning the diagnosis is a shock to the patient. This is as true of the affected children as of their parents and relatives. They are confronted with a statement that there are at present no treatment options. They probably have never felt so alone and abandoned in their lives. The question comes to mind, \"Why me/my child?\" However, there is always hope and especially for affected children, the first priority should be a happy childhood. Too many examinations and doctor appointments take up time and cannot practically solve the problem of a genetic mutation within a few months. It is therefore advisable for parents to treat their child with empathy, but to raise him or her to be independent and self-confident by the teenage years. Openness about the disease and talking with those affected about their experiences, even though its rarity makes it unlikely that others will be personally affected by it, will together assist in managing life.",
    "Epidemiology": "It is estimated to affect less than one in a million people.[2] Only 50 to 100 cases have so far been described.[2]"

    "Disease": "Idiopathic CD4%2B lymphocytopenia",

    "Diagnosis": "The mandatory criteria for diagnosis of idiopathic CD4+ lymphocytopenia include:[8]\nA one-time finding of low CD4+ cells is usually associated with a recent infection and resolves on its own.[7] Alternative explanations for the low CD4 counts include conditions such as blood cancers (aleukemia), treatment with chemotherapy, immunosuppressive medications, or other medications that suppress or kill T cells, infections, and problems with blood production.[2][9][non-primary source needed]\nAll criteria must be fulfilled for a diagnosis of ICL.  In addition, if these findings are present but combined with other significant findings, such as anemia or thrombocytopenia, then other diagnoses must be considered[citation needed].",
    "Treatment": "Fludarabine-based hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has shown to be a feasible treatment for ICL.[10][non-primary source needed]",
    "Prognosis": "In contrast to the CD4+ cell depletion caused by HIV, in general, patients with idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia have a good prognosis.[6][11][12][13][non-primary source needed]  The decline in CD4+ T-cells in patients with ICL is generally slower than that seen in HIV-infected patients.[3] The major risk to people with ICL is unexpected infections, including cryptococcus, atypical mycobacterial and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP).  The condition may also resolve on its own.[14]\nICL sometimes precedes and may be the first signal of several blood cancers.  ICL patients have developed primary effusion lymphoma,[15][non-primary source needed][16] primary leptomeningeal lymphoma,[9] diffuse large cell lymphoma,[17][non-primary source needed] MALT lymphoma,[18] and Burkitt's lymphoma,[19] among others.\nICL may indirectly trigger autoimmune diseases.  It has been associated with several cases of autoimmune disease Sjögren syndrome.[4][20]\nBecause all of the reported autoimmune diseases and lymphomas involve B cells, one hypothesis proposes that ICL's narrow T cell repertoire predisposes the immune system to B cell disorders.[4]",

Other people have chronic problems with bowel movements, resulting in diarrhea, bloating, gas, and cramping which can range from severe to mild.[4][5]\nThe disorder is identified by histopathology showing fat necrosis, fibrosis and chronic inflammation of the small intestine.  Examination of the mesentery may indicate a solitary mass, but diffuse mesentery thickening is common.[4][6]",
    "Diagnosis": "In regards to the diagnosis of idiopathic sclerosing mesenteritis, a CT scan which creates cross-section pictures of the affected individuals body, can help in the assessment of the disease. \"Misty mesentery\" is often used to describe increase in mesenteric fat density in sclerosing mesenteritis. However, it is not specific and can be found in other conditions such as mesenteric oedema, lymphedema, haemorrhage, and presence of neoplastic and inflammatory cells must be excluded. Mesenteric lymph nodes are rarely larger than 10 mm in sclerosing mesenteritis. Larger lymph nodes should prompt further investigations with PET scan or biopsy.[7]\nMRI scan may show an intermediate T1 intensity and variable T2 intensity depending on degree of oedema and fibrosis. Presence of oedema causes high T2 signal while fibrosis causes low T2 signal.[7]\nIt often mimics other abdominal diseases such as pancreatic or disseminated cancer.[8]  CT scanning is important for making the initial diagnosis.[9]",

    "Disease": "Immune thrombocytopenic purpura",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Signs of ITP include the spontaneous formation of bruises (purpura) and petechiae (tiny bruises), especially on the extremities. Additionally, bleeding from the nostrils and/or gums, as well as menorrhagia (excessive menstrual bleeding), may occur if the platelet count falls below 20,000 per μL.[4] A platelet count below 10,000 per μL can lead to the spontaneous formation of hematomas (blood masses) in the mouth or on other mucous membranes. Furthermore, bleeding time from minor lacerations or abrasions is usually prolonged.[citation needed]\nIn cases where platelet counts drop to extremely low levels (<5,000 per μL), serious and potentially fatal complications may arise. These complications include subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhage (bleeding inside the skull or brain), lower gastrointestinal bleeding, or other internal bleeding. A person with ITP with an extremely low platelet count is susceptible to internal bleeding resulting from blunt abdominal trauma, such as in a motor vehicle crash. These complications are more likely to occur when the platelet count is less than 20,000 per μL.[5]",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of ITP is a process of exclusion. First, it has to be determined that there are no blood abnormalities other than a low platelet count, and no physical signs other than bleeding. Then, secondary causes (around 5–10 percent of suspected ITP cases) should be excluded including medications (quinine or heparin), viral infection (HIV or HCV), malignancy (leukemia), autoimmune conditions (systemic lupus erythematosus or antiphospholipid syndrome), onyalai, and others.[4][12] All patients with presumed ITP should be tested for HIV and hepatitis C virus, as platelet counts may be corrected by treating the underlying disease. In approximately 2.7 to 5 percent of cases, autoimmune hemolytic anemia and ITP coexist, a condition referred to as Evans syndrome.[13][14]\nDespite the destruction of platelets by splenic macrophages, the spleen is normally not enlarged. In fact, an enlarged spleen should lead to a search for other possible causes for the thrombocytopenia. Bleeding time is usually prolonged in ITP patients. However, the use of bleeding time in diagnosis is discouraged by the American Society of Hematology practice guidelines[15] and a normal bleeding time does not exclude a platelet disorder.[16]\nBone marrow examination may be performed on patients over the age of 60 and those who do not respond to treatment, or when the diagnosis is in doubt.[12] On examination of the marrow, an increase in the production of megakaryocytes may be observed  and may help in establishing a diagnosis of ITP. An analysis for anti-platelet antibodies is a matter of clinician's preference, as there is disagreement on whether the 80 percent specificity of this test is sufficient to be clinically useful.[12]",
    "Treatment": "With rare exceptions, there is usually no need to treat based on platelet counts. Many older recommendations suggested a certain platelet count threshold (usually somewhere below 20.0/nL) as an indication for hospitalization or treatment. Current guidelines recommend treatment for adults with significant bleeding or counts below 30/nL, with very low certainty of evidence.[17]\nTreatment recommendations sometimes differ for adult and pediatric ITP.[18]\nInitial treatment usually consists of the administration of corticosteroids, a group of medications that suppress the immune system. The dose and mode of administration is determined by platelet count and whether there is active bleeding: in urgent situations, infusions of dexamethasone or methylprednisolone may be used, while oral prednisone or prednisolone may suffice in less severe cases. Once the platelet count has improved, the dose of steroid is gradually reduced while the possibility of relapse is monitored. 60–90 percent will experience a relapse during dose reduction or cessation.[12][19] Long-term steroids are avoided if possible because of potential side-effects that include osteoporosis, diabetes and cataracts.[20]\nAnother option, suitable for Rh-positive patients with functional spleens is intravenous administration of Rho(D) immune globulin [Human; Anti-D]. The mechanism of action of anti-D is not fully understood. However, following administration, anti-D-coated red blood cell complexes saturate Fcγ receptor sites on macrophages, resulting in preferential destruction of red blood cells (RBCs), therefore sparing antibody-coated platelets. There are two anti-D products indicated for use in patients with ITP: WinRho SDF and Rhophylac. The most common adverse reactions are headache (15%), nausea/vomiting (12%) chills (<2%) and fever (1%).[citation needed]. Following a black-box warning of possible uncontrolled hemolytic reactions, use of intravenous anti-D declined sharply.[21] Intramuscular anti-D has been suggested as an alternative, with one case series reporting a 73% response rate.[22]\nThere is increasing use of immunosuppressants such as mycophenolate mofetil and azathioprine because of their effectiveness. In chronic refractory cases, where immune pathogenesis has been confirmed,[23] the off-label use of the vinca alkaloid[24][25][26] and chemotherapy agent vincristine may be attempted.[27][28] However, vincristine has significant side effects[29] and its use in treating ITP must be approached with caution, especially in children.\nIntravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) may be infused in some cases in order to decrease the rate at which macrophages consume antibody-tagged platelets. However, while sometimes effective, it is costly and produces improvement that generally lasts less than a month. Nevertheless, in the case of an ITP patient already scheduled for surgery who has a dangerously low platelet count and has experienced a poor response to other treatments, IVIg can rapidly increase platelet counts, and can also help reduce the risk of major bleeding by transiently increasing platelet counts.[30]",
    "Prognosis": "In general, patients with acute ITP will only rarely have life-threatening bleeding.[54] Most patients ultimately have lower, but stable platelet counts, which are still hemostatic for the patient. Unlike children and adolescents, ITP is often chronic in adults, even after a splenectomy.[40]",
    "Epidemiology": "A normal platelet count is considered to be in the range of 150,000–450,000 per microlitre (μL) of blood for most healthy individuals. Hence one may be considered thrombocytopenic below that range, although the threshold for a diagnosis of ITP is not tied to any specific number.[2]\nThe incidence of ITP is estimated at 50–100 new cases per million per year, with children accounting for half of that number. At least 70 percent of childhood cases will end up in remission within six months, even without treatment.[55][56][57] Moreover, a third of the remaining chronic cases will usually remit during follow-up observation, and another third will end up with only mild thrombocytopenia (defined as a platelet count above 50,000).[55] A number of immune related genes and polymorphisms have been identified as influencing predisposition to ITP, with FCGR3a-V158 allele and KIRDS2/DL2 increasing susceptibility and KIR2DS5 shown to be protective.[58][59]\nITP is usually chronic in adults[60] and the probability of durable remission is 20–40 percent.[19] The male to female ratio in the adult group varies from 1:1.2 to 1.7 in most age ranges (childhood cases are roughly equal for both sexes) and the median age of adults at the diagnosis is 56–60.[12] The ratio between male and female adult cases tends to widen with age. In the United States, the adult chronic population is thought to be approximately 60,000—with women outnumbering men approximately 2 to 1, which has resulted in ITP being designated an orphan disease.[61]\nThe mortality rate due to chronic ITP varies but tends to be higher relative to the general population for any age range. In a study conducted in Great Britain, it was noted that ITP causes an approximately 60 percent higher rate of mortality compared to sex- and age-matched subjects without ITP. This increased risk of death with ITP is largely concentrated in the middle-aged and elderly. Ninety-six percent of reported ITP-related deaths were individuals 45 years or older. No significant difference was noted in the rate of survival between males and females.[62]"

    "Epidemiology": "Cases have been reported in Japan, the United States, and China.[1][2][5] The indium industry is mainly based in Japan, where the bulk of cases have occurred; indium industry is also present in the US, China, Taiwan, and South Korea.[4]  As of 2010, 10 cases had been described, though more than 100 indium workers had documented respiratory abnormalities.[1]"

    "Disease": "Iniencephaly",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The affected infant tends to be short, with a disproportionately large head. The fetal head of infants born with iniencephaly are hyperextended while the foramen magnum is enlarged and opens through the widened pedicles. The defective neural arches directly into the upper cervical reach of the spinal canal, causing the formation of a common cavity between most of the spinal cord and the brain. The skin of the anterior chest is connected directly to the face, bypassing the formation of a neck, while the scalp is directly connected to the skin of the back. Because of this, those born with this anomaly either have a highly shortened neck or no neck at all. This causes extreme retroflexion, or backward bending, of the head in a \"star-gazing\" fashion. The spine is severely distorted as well along with significant shortening due to marked lordosis. The vertebrae, especially cervical, are fused together in abnormal shapes and their numbers are reduced. The spinal cord is almost always defective while the ventricular system is often dilated and the cortex is thinned. Sometimes, in the case of iniencephaly apertus, an encephalocele (sac-like protrusions of the brain through an opening in the cranium) forms.[4][5][6]\nAdditional symptoms include:[4][7]",
    "Causes": "Though the iniencephaly is not genetic with its cause unknown, studies have shown that there are certain factors that can increase the risk of mothers giving birth to children with these anomalies.\nAbnormalities in chromosomes such as trisomy 18, trisomy 13, and monosomy X have been shown to be tied to this disorder.[1]\nMothers with poor socioeconomic conditions, poor nutrition, low parity, and lack of folic acid supplementation, and/or hyperhomocysteinemia have shown to be at larger risk.[1]\nAnimal studies have shown that administration of the drugs vinblastine, streptonigrin, triparano, sulfonamide, tetracycline, antihistamines, and antitumor agents to pregnant mothers have resulted in offspring born with iniencephaly.[7] The drug clomiphene, a drug commonly used for ovulation stimulation in fertility treatments, has also been seen to be associated with iniencephaly.[8]\nStudies have shown that obesity of the mother increases the risk of neural tube disorders such as iniencephaly by 1.7 fold while severe obesity increases the risk by over 3 fold.[9]\nOnce a mother has given birth to a child with iniencephaly, risk of reoccurrence increases to 1-5%.[4]",
    "Diagnosis": "The most accurate method of diagnosis is prenatal screening through real-time fetal images. However, since maternal body habitus leads to diagnostic difficulties using this method, MRI and sonography are the most commonly used technique since there is no exposure to ionizing radiation.[4] At the beginning of the second trimester, the central nervous system (CNS) and anatomic structures of the fetus can be clearly visualized and the characteristic malformations of iniencephaly, such as a shortened trunk, marked lordosis in the cervicothoracic vertebrae, absence or partial absence of the occipital squama, abnormal fusion of vertebrae, closed vertebral arches, formation of an encephalocele (for iniencephaly apertus), and dorsiflexion of the head in respect to the spine, can be precisely diagnosed as well as the severity and location established. Once established, further decisions can be made with regard to terminating the pregnancy or providing a plan of adequate postnatal care.[7]\nSince many of the characteristics of iniencephaly, such as congenital retroflexion of the spine and fusion of the cervical vertebrae, are shared with other disorders, key differences are important to note.[citation needed]\nWhile anencephaly experiences a partial to total lack of the neurocranium, iniencephaly does not. In anencephaly, the retroflexed head is not covered with skin while in iniencephaly, the retroflexed head is covered with skin entirely. Cervical vertebrae are malformed and reduced in iniencephaly while they are almost normal in anencephaly.[citation needed]\nEven though KFS does experience malformed cervical vertebra due to failure of segmentation during early fetal development, there is not retroflexion of the head as seen in iniencephaly. While iniencephaly clausus is fatal, KFS is not and can be surgically corrected. Therefore, it is crucial to correctly diagnose KFS and not mistake it for iniencephaly clausus.[1]",
    "Treatment": "Since newborns with iniencephaly so rarely survive past childbirth, a standard treatment does not exist.[citation needed]",
    "Prognosis": "Iniencephaly of both types carry a lethal prognosis, sometimes even ending in spontaneous abortion or stillborns. Most infants die within hours of childbirth. There are only seven reported cases of relatively long-term survival of those born with iniencephaly.[1]",
    "Epidemiology": "Iniencephaly is thought to make up around 1% of all fetal abnormalities,[5] with an incidence rate estimated at 0.1 to 10 in 10,000 deliveries.\nFor unknown reasons, this disease seems to occur most often in newborn females (about 90%).[4]"

    "Disease": "Intestinal atresia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The most prominent symptom of intestinal atresia is bilious vomiting soon after birth.[1] This is most common in jejunal atresia.[2] Other features include abdominal distension and failure to pass meconium. The distension is more generalised the further down the bowel the atresia is located and is thus most prominent with ileal atresia.[1][2] Inability to pass stool is most common with duodenal or jejunal atresia;[2] if stool is passed, it may be small, mucus-like and grey.[1] Occasionally, there may be jaundice, which is most common in jejunal atresia.[2] Abdominal tenderness or an abdominal mass are not generally seen as symptoms of intestinal atresia. Rather, abdominal tenderness is a symptom of the late complication meconium peritonitis.[1]\nBefore birth, excess amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios) is a possible symptom. This is more common in duodenal and oesophageal atresia.[1]",
    "Causes": "The most common cause of non-duodenal intestinal atresia is a vascular accident in utero that leads to decreased intestinal perfusion and ischemia of the respective segment of bowel.[3] This leads to narrowing, or in the most severe cases, complete obliteration of the intestinal lumen.[citation needed]\nIn the case that the superior mesenteric artery, or another major intestinal artery, is occluded, large segments of bowel can be entirely underdeveloped (Type III). Classically, the affected area of bowel assumes a spiral configuration and is described to have an \"apple peel\" like appearance; this is accompanied by lack of a dorsal mesentery (Type IIIb). [citation needed]\nAn inherited form – familial multiple intestinal atresia – has also been described. This disorder was first reported in 1971.[4] It is due to a mutation in the gene TTC7A on short arm of chromosome 2 (2p16). It is inherited as an autosomal recessive gene and is usually fatal in infancy. Ileal atresia can also result as a complication of meconium ileus.[citation needed]\nA third of infants with intestinal atresia are born prematurely[1] or with low birth weight.[2]",
    "Diagnosis": "Intestinal atresias are often discovered before birth; either during a routine sonogram which shows a dilated intestinal segment  due to the blockage, or by the development of polyhydramnios (the buildup of too much amniotic fluid in the uterus). These abnormalities are indications that the fetus may have a bowel obstruction which a more detailed ultrasound study can confirm.[5] Infants with stenosis instead of atresia are often not discovered until several days after birth.[1]\nSome fetuses with bowel obstruction have abnormal chromosomes. An amniocentesis is recommended because it can determine not only the sex of the baby, but whether or not there is a problem with the chromosomes.[citation needed]\nIf not diagnosed in utero, infants with intestinal atresia are typically diagnosed at day 1 or day 2 after presenting with eating problems, vomiting, and/or failure to have a bowel movement.[3]  Diagnosis can be confirmed with an X-ray, and typically followed with an upper gastrointestinal series, lower gastrointestinal series, and ultrasound.[5][3]\nIntestinal atresia may be classified by its location. Patients may have intestinal atresia in multiple locations.[6]\nMalformations may also occur along multiple portions of the intestinal tract; for instance a malformation that occurs along or spans the length of the jejunum and the ileum is termed jejunoileal atresia.[5][3]\nIntestinal atresia can also by classified by the type of malformation.[8] The classification system by Bland-Sutton and Louw and Barnard (1955)[9] initially divided them into three types.[8][5] This was later expanded to five by Zerella and Grosfeld et al.[2]\nIn type I, there is a wall (septum) or membrane at some point in the bowel, leading to dilation of the bowel on the nearer side and a collapse of the bowel on the latter side. Bowel length is not usually affected in this type.[1]\nIn type II, there is a gap in the bowel, and either end of the remaining intestine is closed off and connected to the other by a fibrous cord that runs along the edge of the mesentery. The mesentery remains intact.[1]\nType IIIa is similar to type II, but the mesentery is defective (there is a V-shaped gap),[2] and the bowel length may be shortened.[1]\nIn type IIIb, also known as the \"apple peel\" or \"Christmas tree\" deformity, the atresia affects the jejunum, and the intestine is often malrotated with most of the mesenteric arteries absent. The remaining ileum, which is of varying length, survives on a single mesenteric artery, which it is twisted around in a spiral form.[1] The term apple-peel intestinal atresia is generally reserved for when it affects the jejunum,[10][11] while Christmas tree intestinal atresia is used if it affects the duodenum. It may affect both, however.[6]\nType IV involves a combination of all the other types and takes the appearance of a string of sausages. The length of the bowel is always shortened, but the last part of the ileum is usually not affected, as in type III.[1] This type usually affects the nearest end of the jejunum, but the far end of the ileum may instead be affected.[2]",
    "Treatment": "Fetal and neonatal intestinal atresia are treated using laparotomy after birth. If the area affected is small, the surgeon may be able to remove the damaged portion and join the intestine back together. In instances where the narrowing is longer, or the area is damaged and cannot be used for period of time, a temporary stoma may be placed.[citation needed]\nThe infant is usually given intravenous fluid hydration, and a nasogastric or orogastric tube may be used to aspirate the contents of the stomach. The nutritional administration is maintained after surgery until the bowel can resume normal function.[1]",
    "Prognosis": "Prognosis is usually good if treated with surgery in infancy. The main factor in mortality is the availability of care and appropriate parenteral nutrition after surgery until the bowel can resume normal function.[1]\nThe most common complication is pseudo-obstruction at the site of surgery due to pre-existing intestinal dysmotility. This can usually only be treated by non-surgical methods.[1]\nIf the atresia is not treated, the bowel may become perforated or ischemic. This can lead to abdominal tenderness and meconium peritonitis, which can be fatal.[1]",
    "Epidemiology": "Intestinal atresia occurs in around 1 in 3,000 births in the United States.[1] The most common form of intestinal atresia is duodenal atresia. It has a strong association with Down syndrome.[12] The second-most common type is ileal atresia. 95% of congenital jejunoileal obstructions are atresias; only 5% are stenoses.[2]\nPrevalence of jejunoileal atresia is 1 to 3 in 10,000 live births. It is weakly associated with cystic fibrosis, intestinal malrotation, and gastroschisis.[3]\nThe frequencies of each type from Louw and Barnard's classification are as follows:[1][13][2]"

    "Disease": "Isovaleric acidemia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "A characteristic feature of isovaleric acidemia is a distinctive odor of sweaty feet.[4] This odor is caused by the buildup of a compound called isovaleric acid in affected individuals.[5]\nIn about half of cases, the signs and symptoms of this disorder become apparent within a few days after birth and include poor feeding, vomiting, seizures, and lack of energy that can progress to coma. These medical problems are typically severe and can be life-threatening. In the other half of cases, the signs and symptoms of the disorder appear during childhood and may come and go over time. They are often triggered by an infection.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "The urine of newborns can be screened for isovaleric acidemia using mass spectrometry,[3] allowing for early diagnosis. Elevations of isovalerylglycine in urine and of isovalerylcarnitine in plasma are found.",
    "Treatment": "Treatment consists of dietary protein restriction, particularly leucine. During acute episodes, glycine is sometimes given, which conjugates with isovalerate forming isovalerylglycine, or carnitine which has a similar effect.[citation needed]\nElevated 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid is a clinical biomarker of biotin deficiency. Without biotin, leucine and isoleucine cannot be metabolized normally and results in elevated synthesis of isovaleric acid and consequently 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid, isovalerylglycine, and other isovaleric acid metabolites as well. Elevated serum 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid concentrations can be caused by supplementation with 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid, genetic conditions, or dietary deficiency of biotin.  Some patients with isovaleric acidemia may benefit from supplemental biotin.[7] Biotin deficiency on its own can have severe physiological and cognitive consequences[8] that closely resemble symptoms of organic acidemias.",
    "Prognosis": "A 2011 review of 176 cases found that diagnoses made early in life (within a few days of birth) were associated with more severe disease and a mortality of 33%. Children diagnosed later, and who had milder symptoms, showed a lower mortality rate of ~3%.[9]",

    "Diagnosis": "An individual may be suspected to have this condition based on their medical history, physical exam findings, and blood tests, and confirmation of the diagnosis can be made with further testing, often with use of gene panels.[citation needed]\nJuvenile hemochromatosis shares signs and symptoms with many other conditions including:[2][3][4]\nThe presence of hemochromatosis may be discovered incidentally on blood testing, or a diagnosis suspected based on symptoms may be supported or ruled out by blood testing. Elevated serum ferritin, an indicator of blood iron levels, and transferrin saturation, which is involved with absorption of iron from the gut, are very common.[2][3]\nIn patients suspected to have juvenile hemochromatosis, the diagnosis can be confirmed through genetic testing for specific genes:[4]\nMRI may be utilized in order to assess the extent to which iron has been deposited in certain tissues and organs, however does not have significant weight in the diagnosis of the condition.[4]\nLiver biopsy, or removal of a small piece of liver tissue for analysis, can be done to assess the extent of iron overload in the liver, however is considered not to have a significant weight in the diagnosis of the condition.[4]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment for juvenile hemochromatosis is similar to that for other forms of hemochromatosis and iron overload, and focuses on reducing the amount of iron in the body in order to prevent complications of iron overload.[2][3][4] However, if the disease is not discovered early enough, or if progress is not well controlled, further treatments may be aimed at the symptoms of organ damage which may develop.\nPhlebotomy, the removal of blood from the body, is the main treatment for juvenile hemochromatosis. One unit of blood, the amount typically given during blood donation, is typically removed per session, and it is generally recommended that this be done once weekly until acceptable levels of iron are in the blood, which may take years.[4] After these levels are reached, phlebotomy will be continued, but less often than once weekly, perhaps every few months.[3]\nIn the event that phlebotomy is not an appropriate option or is not enough on its own to reduce iron levels, chelation medications, those that bind and remove certain metals from the blood, may be utilized.[2][3][4] Examples of chelators specifically for iron include deferoxamine and deferasirox.\nIt is recommended that those with juvenile hemochromatosis refrain from eating iron supplements, vitamin C supplements, and uncooked/undercooked seafood and shellfish, and reduce or eliminate consumption of alcoholic beverages and red meat.[1][3][4]\nIf the disease is advanced enough, further treatments can be aimed at the complications of the disease, depending on which are present:[2][4]",
    "Epidemiology": "The incidence of juvenile hemochromatosis in the general population remains unknown at this time, however it is very rare. It more commonly occurs in those of European descent, becoming apparent during the first to third decades of life, and affects males and females at similar rates.[2][3][4]"

    "Disease": "Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Neuromuscular symptoms include muscle weakness and wasting of the limb, bulbar and respiratory muscles, tremor, fasciculations, muscle cramps, speech and swallowing difficulties, decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes, and sensory neuropathy. Other manifestations of SBMA include androgen insensitivity (gynecomastia, erectile dysfunction, reduced fertility, testicular atrophy), and metabolic impacts (glucose resistance, hyperlipidemia, fatty liver disease).[3][5][10]\nSBMA patients develop limb weakness which often begins in the pelvic or shoulder regions between 30 and 50 years of age.[11] Muscle strength declines slowly, at a rate of approximately 2% per year based on quantitative muscle assessment.[11][12] Muscle weakness often begins in proximal muscles, with most patients first noticing weakness in their lower limbs.[3][13]\nTremor, fasciculations, and cramps are common early symptoms of SBMA. Tremor is an involuntary, somewhat rhythmic, muscle contraction and relaxation involving oscillations or twitching movements. In SBMA patients, tremor is most common in the hands, but also occur in the head, voice and lower limbs, and may be observed ten years prior to muscle weakness.[11][3] Fasciculation, or fleeting muscle twitches visible under the skin, is a spontaneous, involuntary muscle contraction and relaxation, and is especially noticeable in the face and tongue of SBMA patients. Lingual atrophy occurs later in the course of the disease, but the tongue may develop an unusual shape due to coexisting denervation and reinnervation. A cramp is a sudden, involuntary, painful skeletal muscle contraction of skeletal muscle, and common in motor neuron disorders.\nBulbar symptoms (weakness of the facial and tongue muscles) typically follow limb manifestations and may start with difficulty with speech articulation (dysarthria) before swallowing difficulty (dysphagia).[3][5][11] Dysarthria is common, with hypernasality due to incomplete lifting of soft palate, but typically remains relatively mild and seldom leads to the loss of oral communication.[3] Signs of dysphagia include difficulty controlling solids, liquids or saliva in the mouth, coughing and choking. As the disease progresses, there is increased risk of aspiration pneumonia, which is the leading cause of death in SBMA patients.[3] Up to half of all patients experience laryngospasm, an uncontrolled contraction (spasm) of the vocal folds, with a sense of choking, and feel that the air cannot enter or exit the airways for long seconds. Laryngospasms are often followed by a high-pitched breathing sound (stridor) due to rapid and vigorous contraction of the laryngeal sphincters. This is a frightening and hugely distressing experience, but rarely escalates to prolonged or serious episodes.[3]\nIn SBMA, deep tendon reflexes are diminished or absent. Sensory involvement results in degeneration of dorsal root ganglion cells with reduced vibratory sensation (distally in the legs), neuropathic pain, and numbness.[11] There are sporadic reports of certain psychological traits (lack of self-confidence, emotional flattening, and poor concentration), but detailed neuropsychological examination of 64 SBMA patients did not detect any abnormalities.[3][14]\nLoss of AR function in SBMA patients results in partial androgen insensitivity, including gynecomastia, erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, infertility and testicular atrophy.[3][10] Patients with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome do not show symptoms of SBMA, indicating neuromuscular symptoms are not caused by a loss of AR function.[11]\nGynecomastia, excessive enlargement of male breasts, is observed in about three quarters of SBMA patients. It typically becomes apparent after puberty, and is often the first evidence of this disease.[10] Erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, infertility and testicular atrophy are common.[15] One of the most disease-specific endocrine indices of SBMA is the androgen sensitivity index (luteinizing hormone / testosterone) which is elevated in 64% of cases, indicating both endocrine and exocrine testicular dysfunction.[3][15]\nMetabolic disturbances have also been reported in SBMA patients, with increased risk of insulin resistance, fatty liver disease, hyperlipidemia, and electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities. Impaired glucose homeostasis is a common feature of SBMA, and recent study found a significant correlation between insulin resistance and motor dysfunction in SBMA.[11][16] In a group of 22 patients with SBMA, evidence of fatty liver disease was detected in all individuals by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In a second group, liver dome magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements were increased in participants with SBMA relative to age- and sex-matched controls.[3][17] SBMA patients may have higher frequency of Brugada syndrome and other electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities, which if not detected, can lead to sudden death. There are no reports of cardiomyopathy. However, there are indications that SBMA patients may be more likely to have high blood pressure and elevated total cholesterol and triglycerides.[11][3]\nProgression of muscle weakness is slow, with an approximately 2% decrease in muscle strength by quantitative muscle testing (QMT) per year.[11][12]\nThe most extensive dataset on disease progression is a study of 223 Japanese patients where milestones in nine activities of daily living (ADL) was observed for up to 20 years.[3][10][11][18] Muscle weakness was first noticed in the lower extremities (71%), upper extremities in (31%), bulbar symptoms (11%), and facial weakness (2%), with some patients observing initial muscle weakness simultaneously in two locations.[18] Hand tremor was noticed first (median age: 33 years), followed by muscular weakness (median = 44 years), need for handrail to ascend stairs (49 years), dysarthria (50 years), dysphagia (54 years), use of a cane (59 years), and wheelchair use (61 years).[18] Twenty-one patients developed pneumonia (median age: 62 years) and 15 of them died (median = 65 years). The most common cause of death in these cases was pneumonia and respiratory failure.[18] There was considerable variation in the age of onset for each milestone, often varying by 25 to 30 years between the 10th to 90th percentile ranges. The ages at onset of each ADL milestone were strongly correlated with the length of CAG repeats in the AR gene. However CAG-repeat length did not correlate with the time intervals between each ADL milestone, suggesting that the rate of disease progression does not correlate with CAG-repeat length.[18] The average time interval between muscle weakness and handrail use was 5–6 years, between weakness and cane use was 9–11 years, between weakness and wheelchair use was 12–13 years, and between weakness and death was 10–20 years.[18]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis of SBMA is established by genetic testing that identifies a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the AR gene.[5] If more than 38 CAG repeats are identified, it is usually considered confirmatory of SBMA.[3] However, there is evidence for reduced penetrance with 36–37 CAG repeats.[26]",
    "Treatment": "There is no known cure for SBMA.[7][8][9] Supportive care is focused on preventing disease complications (falls, fractures, aspiration) and maintaining independence.  Early interventions include occupational therapy to maintain mobility and activities of daily living.  Common mobility aids include canes, mobility scooters, power wheelchairs, ramps, and stair lifts.  As the disease progresses, swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) become more common and patients are at increased risk of aspiration pneumonia.  Swallowing interventions include dietary modifications (adjust food texture and consistency), postural techniques, and swallowing maneuvers. Respiratory therapy may be helpful to reduce respiratory tract infections and mobilize phlegm.[3]\nExercise has been shown to provide a variety of benefits in several neuromuscular diseases. However, in SBMA patients, exercise can have both positive and negative impacts.[27] In a study with 8 SBMA patients, moderate-intensity exercise was not well tolerated, and exercise frequency was decreased prior to the end of the training program.  Levels of creatine kinase (CK), a biomarker of muscle degeneration, were found to increase during intense exercise, indicating primary myopathy.[28][29]  In a study of home-based functional exercise with 50 SBMA patients, both the low-intensity exercise and stretching control groups tolerated exercise well, but there was no significant difference in primary and secondary outcomes between the two groups.[11][29]  However, subgroup analysis did show benefit for a low-functioning group, suggesting there may be a role for exercise in these patients.[11]  In a third study, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) for less than one hour per week, improved both VO2max and performed workload, without increasing CK levels, self-rated fatigue and pain.[27][30] Overall, these results suggest that exercise programs should be individually tailored, and SBMA patients must be carefully monitored for maladaptive biomarkers (increasing CK levels) to prevent muscle damage and worsening of disease phenotypes.[27]",
    "Society and culture": "In 2000, the Kennedy's Disease Association[32][33][34] was founded by Susanne and Terry Waite and Patrick Griffin to help find effective treatments and a cure for SBMA.  The organization is managed and operated by an all-volunteer board of directors, and grown to over 1,600 associates from over 50 countries. Donations from patients and families provide funding to support research (90%), education (5%) and operating expenses (5%).[34]  KDA has awarded grants and fellowships to researchers in the United States, Canada, Britain, Italy, and Japan to support both basic research and clinical trials on the causes and potential treatments for SBMA. [35] The KDA website states that they focus on providing \"seed-money\" to post-doc and other young researchers to start working on SBMA, collecting preliminary data that can be used to support larger proposals to governmental and philanthropic organizations.  In 2022, the KDA Waite-Griffin Fellowship was established to encourage young researchers to include research on SBMA in their future career plans.[35]"

    "Disease": "Kienb%C3%B6ck%27s disease",
    "Causes": "The cause of Kienböck's disease is unclear. Possible causes include trauma, particularly to the wrist; variations in the blood supply of the lunate bone; and differences in the length of the ulna (one of the bones in the forearm), known as ulnar variance. Negative ulnar variance means that the ulna is shorter than the radius, and is associated with an increased risk of Kienböck's disease. The bone loses its blood supply, leading to avascular necrosis. Recent imaging and histological studies have reinforced the importance of intraosseous vascularity, independent of factors like ulnar variance.[3]\nStudies have found a correlation between having Kienböck's and Western European ancestry, but no definitive link can be positively confirmed[citation needed].\nThe necrosis of the lunate bone can frequently be traced to a trauma to the wrist, like a compound fracture, which could cause the lunate's blood supply to be interrupted. Blood flows to the lunate through several arteries, each supplying a percentage. When one of these pathways is severed, the likelihood the patient will develop necrosis increases.[4]\nDespite a preponderance of evidence, no particular cause has been conclusively verified.[citation needed]\nData suggests[citation needed] that most people with Kienböck's are affected in their dominant hand, though about one-third report the condition in their non-dominant hand. In very few cases have there been people that have acquired it in both wrists.[citation needed]\nKienböck's disease is classified as a \"rare disorder,\" meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. population.[5]\nMany people with Kienböck's are frustrated by the lack of consensus among hand surgeons about optimal treatments for Kienböck's.[citation needed]  No matter what the disease's stage of progression, there is no one best treatment, and the decision is often based partially, or even mostly, on incidental factors such as the patient's pain tolerance, the patient's desire to return to active use of the hand (such as in manual occupations), and the surgeon's level of expertise with different treatments.[6]\nThough, since each case of Kienböck's is different, the makeup of the wrist and arm bones are important factors which are individualized to each patient. Therefore, one surgery will never be able to solve all the problems associated with the disease. Thus, no consensus can be reached among surgeons.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "First described by David Lichtman et al. in 1977.[7]\nThe purpose of this classification system is to guide treatment and to enable comparison of clinical outcomes.",
    "Treatment": "Operations that attempt to restore a blood supply to the lunate may be performed.[citation needed]\nDepending on the stage the disease is in when it is discovered, varying treatments are applied.[citation needed]\nIf X-rays show a mostly intact lunate (not having lost a great deal of size, and not having been compressed into a triangular shape), but an MRI shows a lack of blood flow to the bone, then revascularization is normally attempted. Revascularization techniques, usually involving a bone graft taken elsewhere from the body — often held in place by an external fixator for a period of weeks or months — have been successful at stages as late as 3B, although their use at later stages (like most treatments for Kienböck's) is controversial. One conservative treatment option would be using an Ultrasound Bone Stimulator, which uses low-intensity pulsed ultrasound to increase vascular endothelial growth factor (VEG-F) and increase blood flow to the bone.\nSome Kienböck's patients present with an abnormally large difference in length between the radius and the ulna, termed \"ulnar variance\", which is hypothesized to cause undue pressure on the lunate, contributing to its avascularity. In cases with such a difference, radial shortening is commonly performed. In this procedure, the radius (the lateral long bone) is shortened by a given length, usually between 2 and 5 mm, to relieve the pressure on the dying lunate. A titanium plate is inserted to hold the newly shortened bone together.[citation needed]\nDuring Stage 3, the lunate has begun to break apart due to the pressure of the surrounding bones. This causes sharp fragments of bone to float between the joints, causing excruciating pain. At this point, the lunate is ready for removal. The most frequently performed surgery is the Proximal Row Carpectomy, where the lunate, scaphoid and triquetrum are extracted. This greatly limits the range of motion of the wrist, but pain relief can be achieved for longer than after the other surgeries.\nAnother surgical option for this stage is a titanium, silicon or pyrocarbon implant that takes place of the lunate, though doctors shy from this due to a tendency of the implant to smooth the edges of the surrounding bones, thus causing painful pinched nerves when the bones slip out of place.\nAfter the lunate is removed, another procedure, ulnar shortening can be performed. This relieves pressure on the newly formed wrist joint of the pisiform, hamate and capitate. Depending on the surgeon, the procedure may be performed the same way as the radial shortening where a small section is removed, or the entire top of the ulna may be excised.\nAt Stage 4, the lunate has completely disintegrated and the other bones in the wrist have radiated downward to fill in the void. The hand now has a deformed appearance. The only procedure that can be done is the total wrist fusion, where a plate is inserted on the top of the wrist from the radius to the carpals, effectively freezing all flexion and movement in the wrist. Rotation is still possible as it is controlled by the radius and ulna.\nThis is currently the last and most complete surgical option for those with Kienböck's. Most of the treatments described here are not mutually exclusive — meaning that a single patient may receive many of them in his quest to relieve pain.  For instance, some patients have had casting, bone graft, radial shortening, proximal row carpectomy, and wrist fusion, all on the same hand. Recent studies suggest that vascularized bone grafting techniques, such as the use of pedicled or free vascularized grafts, may enhance revascularization of the lunate and improve functional outcomes, particularly in younger patients with early-stage disease.[8] Arthroscopic techniques have also gained popularity due to their minimally invasive nature and potential for quicker recovery.[9]",
    "Prognosis": "The prognosis of Kienböck's disease largely depends on the stage at diagnosis and the treatment modality employed. Early-stage disease managed conservatively may result in minimal long-term impairment. However, in advanced stages, there is a significant risk of lunate collapse, progressive wrist arthritis, and functional limitation despite surgical intervention.[10]"

    "Disease": "Kikuchi disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The signs and symptoms of Kikuchi disease are fever, enlargement of the lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), skin rashes, and headache.[7] In sixty to ninety percent of cases, lymphadenopathy presents in the posterior cervical lymph nodes with diameter enlargement typically being between one and two centimeters, but up to seven centimeters has been reported in literature. Occasionally, the supraclavicular and axillary lymph nodes become swollen as well.[8] Rarely, enlargement of the liver and spleen and nervous system involvement resembling meningitis are seen. Often a bout of extreme fatigue can occur - often taking hold during latter parts of the day and the affected person can be more prone to fatigue from exercise.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "It is diagnosed by lymph node excision biopsy. Kikuchi disease is a self-limiting illness which has symptoms which may overlap with Hodgkin's lymphoma leading to misdiagnosis in some patients. Antinuclear antibodies, antiphospholipid antibodies, anti-dsDNA, and rheumatoid factor are usually negative, and may help in differentiation from systemic lupus erythematosus.[12]\nThe differential diagnosis of Kikuchi disease includes systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), disseminated tuberculosis, lymphoma, sarcoidosis, and viral lymphadenitis. Clinical findings sometimes may include positive results for IgM/IgG/IgA antibodies. For other causes of lymph node enlargement, see lymphadenopathy.[13]",
    "Treatment": "No specific cure is known. Treatment is largely supportive. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are indicated for tender lymph nodes and fever, and corticosteroids are useful in severe extranodal or generalized disease.[12]\nSymptomatic measures aimed at relieving the distressing local and systemic complaints have been described as the main line of management of KFD. Analgesics, antipyretics, NSAIDs, and corticosteroids have been used. If the clinical course is more severe, with multiple flares of bulky enlarged cervical lymph nodes and fever, then a low-dose corticosteroid treatment has been suggested.[12]",
    "Epidemiology": "Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD) is a rare, self-limiting disorder that typically affects the cervical lymph nodes. Recognition of this condition is crucial, especially because it can easily be mistaken for tuberculosis, lymphoma, or even adenocarcinoma. Awareness of this disorder helps prevent misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment.[1]\nKikuchi's disease is a very rare disease mainly seen in Japan. Isolated cases are reported in North America, Europe, Asia, England, and at least two cases in New Zealand. It is possible that the prevalence of KFD is greater than is reported given lymphadenopathy can be overlooked and the disease's self-limiting nature. That a definite identification of KFD can only be done via a biopsy of affected tissues further suggests that cases go unrecognized or undiagnosed.[14] It is mainly a disease of young adults (20–30 years), with a slight bias towards females. The cause of this disease is not known, although infectious and autoimmune causes have been proposed. The course of the disease is generally benign and self-limiting. Lymph node enlargement usually resolves over several weeks to six months. The recurrence rate is about 3%. Death from Kikuchi disease is extremely rare and usually occurs due to liver, respiratory, or heart failure.[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "Kimura%27s disease",
    "Causes": "Its cause remains unknown. Reasons such as an allergic reaction, tetanus toxoid vaccination,[2][3][4] or an alteration of immune regulation are suspected. Other theories like persistent antigenic stimulation following arthropod bites and parasitic or candidal infection have also been proposed. To date, none of these theories has been substantiated.[1]",
    "Diagnosis": "An open biopsy is the chief means by which this disease is diagnosed.[citation needed]\n\"Lymphoid nodules with discrete germinal centers can occupy an area extending from the reticular dermis to the fascia and muscle. Follicular hyperplasia, marked eosinophilic infiltrate and eosinophilic abscesses, and the proliferation of postcapillary venules are characteristic histological findings. [18] Centrally, thick-walled vessels are present with hobnail endothelial cells. Immunohistochemical evaluation of the lymphoid nodules demonstrates a polymorphous infiltrate without clonality. [12, 27] Reports have also demonstrated the presence of plasmacytoid dendritic cells in a lesion of Kimura disease. [40] Histopathological examination is an effective way to establish the diagnosis.\"[7]",
    "Treatment": "Observation is acceptable if the lesions are neither symptomatic nor disfiguring. Intralesional or oral steroids can shrink the nodules, but seldom result in cure. Cyclosporine has been reported to induce remission in patients with Kimura's disease, but recurrence of the lesions has been observed once this therapy is stopped.[citation needed]\nCetirizine is an effective agent in treating its symptoms. Cetirizine's properties of being effective both in the treatment of pruritus (itching) and as an anti-inflammatory agent make it suitable for the treatment of the pruritus associated with these lesions.[8]  In a 2005 study, the American College of Rheumatology conducted treatments initially using prednisone, followed by steroid dosages and azathioprine,  omeprazole, and calcium and vitamin D supplements over the course of two years.[8] The skin condition of the patient began to improve and the skin lesions lessened. However, symptoms of cushingoid and hirsutism were observed before the patient was removed from the courses of steroids and placed on 10 mg/day of cetirizine to prevent skin lesions;[8] an agent suitable for the treatment of pruritus associated with such lesions.[8] Asymptomatically, the patient's skin lesions disappeared after treatment with cetirizine, blood eosinophil counts became normal,[8]  corticosteroid effects were resolved,[8] and a remission began within a period of two months.[8]  The inhibition of eosinophils may be the key to treatment of Kimura's disease due to the role of eosinophils, rather than other cells with regards to the lesions of the skin.[8]\nRadiotherapy has been used to treat recurrent or persistent lesions. However, considering the benign nature of this disease, radiation should be considered only in cases of recurrent, disfiguring lesions.[citation needed]\nSurgery has been considered the mainstay of therapy. However, recurrence after surgery is common.[9]\nIn 2011, an eight-year-old boy had presented with a firm, nontender, nonfluctuating 15- to 12-cm mass on the left side of the neck involving the lateral region of the neck and jaw and a 5- to 7-cm mass on the right side of his neck. He had an eosinophil concentration of 36% (absolute count: 8172/mL), his IgE level was 9187 IU/mL. He was diagnosed with Kimura's disease. Initially treated with corticosteroids, he was given a single dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as a steroid-sparing agent after the disease flared while tapering prednisone. After IVIG administration, improvement was rapid, both left and right cervical masses diminished to less than 1 cm and his eosinophil and IgE levels returned to normal range. He has been free of disease during a six-year follow-up. IVIG may have value in the treatment of Kimura's disease.[10]\nA study is going on to assess the efficacy of tacrolimus on Kimura's disease. One case has so far been described. A patient with refractory Kimura's disease after surgery and treatment with prednisone was treated with tacrolimus. Tacrolimus (FK-506) was administered at an initial dosage of 1 mg every 12 hours, and FK-506 concentration in the blood was monitored monthly. FK-506 blood concentration was controlled within 5 to 15 μg/L. After 6 months, the dosage of tacrolimus was reduced to 0.5 mg daily for another 2 months and then treatment was stopped. Swelling of the bilateral salivary glands disappeared within the first week. No serious side effects were noted and the disease has not recurred in the 2 years of follow-up. Tacrolimus may be an effective treatment for patients with Kimura's disease, but more research is needed to determine its long-term efficacy and safety, as well as its mechanism of action.[11]",
    "Epidemiology": "Kimura's disease is said to be predominantly seen in males of Asian descent.[1] However, a study of 21 cases in the United States showed no racial preference, of 18 males and three females (male/female ratio 6:1), 8 to 64 years of age (mean, 32 years), and seven Caucasians, six Blacks, six Asians, one Hispanic, and an Arab were included.[12]\nAssessing the prevalence is difficult. The medical literature alone holds over 500 case reports and series (typically two, three cases) from the 1980s to early 2017 in English, excluding the existing Chinese, Japanese, and Korean medical reports that add more cases.[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "K%C3%B6hler disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Affected individuals experience pain and swelling in the middle part of the foot and usually limp as a result. Patients who walk with a limp tend to walk with increased weight on the lateral side of the foot. Also, there can be tenderness over the navicular. Patients often complain of pain over the apex.\nAn X-ray of both feet is used to diagnose disease. The affected foot tends to have a sclerotic and flattened navicular bone. Symptoms may last for a few weeks or may continue to be present for up to 2 years.[4] An indication of the symptoms residing is the resolution of the acute inflammation and obvious healing of the foot. This means that the affected bone and the Tarsal Navicular begin to regain their normal size, density and structure.[5]",
    "Causes": "The cause of Köhler's disease, has thus far, been declared unknown by scientists.[5] However, it is suspected that possible causes may be caused by strain on the foot and the blood vessels associated with it, before the bone is fully able to grow into its adult form (ossification).[5] This bone ossification usually begins within the first 18 to 24 months of a female's life and the first 24 to 30 months of a male's life. Ossification will occur more slowly on the tarsal navicular bone than on other bones of the foot. This causes an overall loss of blood supply in the areas surrounding, as a result of the compression.[5] Furthermore, some scientists have suggested that genetic factors could play a significant role in the development of the disease, however no direct causation has been identified, nor a disease-causing gene.[5]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is made on the basis of history and a high index of suspicion. On examination there is tenderness to palpation on navicular head. Radiographs reveal typical changes of increased density and narrowing of the navicular bone.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment usually involves resting the affected foot, taking pain relievers and trying to avoid putting pressure on the foot. In acute cases, the patient is often fitted with a cast that stops below the knee. The cast is usually worn for 6 to 8 weeks. After the cast is taken off, some patients are prescribed arch support for about 6 months. Also, moderate exercise is often beneficial, and physical therapy may help as well.[citation needed]\nPrognosis for children with this disease is very good. It may persist for some time, but most cases are resolved within two years of the initial diagnosis. Although in most cases no permanent damage is done, some will have lasting damage to the foot."

    "Disease": "Krabbe disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Symptoms in asymptomatic infantile-onset (less than 12 months after birth) and later-onset Krabbe disease present themselves differently. Of individuals with infantile-onset KD, 85–90% display progressive neurologic deterioration in infancy and death before the age of two.[5] Symptoms include irritability, fevers, limb stiffness, seizures, feeding difficulties (like gastroesophageal reflux disease), vomiting, staring episodes, and slowing of mental and motor development. In the first stages of the disease, doctors often mistake the symptoms for those of cerebral palsy. Other symptoms include muscle weakness, spasticity, deafness, optic atrophy, optic nerve enlargement,[6] blindness, paralysis, and difficulty when swallowing. Prolonged weight loss may also occur.[citation needed]\nAbout 10–15% of individuals with later-onset KD have a much slower disease progression. These individuals may also display symptoms such as esotropia, slurred speech, and slow development or loss of motor milestones.[5]",
    "Causes": "Krabbe disease is caused by mutations in the GALC gene located on chromosome 14 (14q31),[7] which is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Mutations in the GALC gene cause a deficiency of the enzyme galactosylceramidase (GALC).[8] In rare cases, it may be caused by a lack of active saposin A (a derivative of prosaposin).[1]\nThe buildup of unmetabolized lipids adversely affects the growth of the nerve's protective myelin sheath (the covering that insulates many nerves) resulting in demyelination and severe progressive degeneration of motor skills. As part of a group of disorders known as leukodystrophies, KD results from the imperfect growth and development of myelin.[citation needed]\nGalactosylceramidase deficiency also results in a buildup of the glycosphingolipid psychosine, which is toxic to oligodendrocytes, a type of non-neuronal cells found in the nervous system, collectively termed neuroglia.[9]",
    "Diagnosis": "A few ways to help pinpoint the presence of Krabbe disease are known. Newborn screening for KD includes assaying dried blood cells for GALC enzyme activity and molecular analysis for evidence of GALC enzyme mutations. Infants displaying low enzyme activity and/or enzyme mutations should be referred for additional diagnostic testing and neurological examination.[10] Up to 5% GALC enzyme activity is observed in all symptomatic individuals with Krabbe disease.[5] High concentration of psychosine in dried blood spots may also be identified as a marker for KD.[11] A 2011 study discovered that individuals with KD, more so in later-onset individuals, tend to have an abnormal increase in CSF protein concentration.[12]\nThe disease may be diagnosed by its characteristic grouping of certain cells (multinucleated globoid cells), nerve demyelination and degeneration, and destruction of brain cells. Special stains for myelin (e.g., luxol fast blue) may be used to aid diagnosis[citation needed].\nNew York,[13] Missouri, and Kentucky[14] include KD in their newborn screening panel.[15] Indiana started screening in 2020.[16]",
    "Treatment": "Although no cure for Krabbe disease is known, bone marrow transplantation and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) have been shown to benefit cases early in the course of the disease. Generally, treatment for the disorder is symptomatic and supportive. Physical therapy may help maintain or increase muscle tone and circulation.[citation needed]\nA 15-year study on the developmental outcomes of children with KD who underwent HSCT in the first seven weeks after birth found that patients have a better prognosis for both lifespan and functionality, with a slower disease progression.[17] Even symptomatic individuals with later-onset Krabbe disease may benefit from HSCT if diagnosed early enough.[18] Umbilical-cord blood is typically used as the source for the transplant stem cells.[19] Clinical trials for gene therapy are currently enrolling patients.[20]\nSymptom management can be particularly difficult for individuals with infantile-onset KD, as symptoms tend to progress rapidly.[19] Because no treatment is available for KD, management of the condition is typically supportive and aimed at alleviating symptoms. Frequent evaluation is encouraged to anticipate the onset of and preparation for certain symptoms.[5] Physical therapy can help to alleviate motor difficulties and increase strength, mobility, and flexibility.[5]\nGastrostomy tubes are used to circumvent feeding difficulties and prevent aspiration. A simultaneous gastrostomy tube insertion and Nissen fundoplication procedure is commonly performed to prevent the need for a secondary surgical procedure.[19] Individuals with KD with severe motor deficits tend to be more susceptible to overfeeding, as they require less calorie consumption, thus consuming fewer calories than caretakers may expect.[19] Also, some evidence indicates that routine vaccines may accelerate disease progression; many individuals with KD tend to not follow traditional vaccination procedures.[19]",
    "Prognosis": "In infantile Krabbe disease, death usually occurs in early childhood. A 2011 study found one-, two-, and three-year survival rates of 60%, 26%, and 14%, respectively, with a few surviving longer. Patients with late-onset Krabbe disease tend to have a slower disease progression and live significantly longer.[2]",
    "Epidemiology": "This disease also impacts other animals such as monkeys, mice, and dogs. While certain gene deletions are more frequent than others, novel mutations resulting in Krabbe disease have been discovered worldwide. Most commonly, the underlying cause of the disease is a deletion of a GALC gene, which causes a deficiency in the GALC enzyme. This is the circumstance in 80% of patients who have European and Mexican origins.[21] The mortality rate of early-infantile KD is 90% before age two. Later onset of symptoms is associated with longer life expectancy, with older children generally surviving two to seven years after the initial diagnosis.[22]\nKrabbe disease occurs in about one in 100,000 births.[23] Because the disease is genetic, incidence rates vary widely from population to population.[21] The incidence rate is extremely low in Japan, with between 5 and 10 cases per 1,000,000 live births. In the United States, KD occurs in about one of every 100,000 live births.[24] Scandinavian countries report incidence rates of one in 50,000 births.[25] In certain communities, KD is much more frequent, such as the Druze community in Israel, which has an incidence rate of six of every 1,000 live births,[24] thought to be due in part to a high frequency of consanguineous marriages. Almost 35% of all Druze marriages were found to be between first-cousin familial relations.[26] No cases of KD have been reported among the Jewish community.[24]\nThe time of onset also varies in frequency by location. Early infantile KD is the most common form of the disease overall, but Nordic communities tend to have even higher rates of early-infantile onset KD, while Southern European countries have higher incidences of late-onset cases. Estimating the incidence of adult-onset KD is difficult due to discrepancies in classifying cases as late-onset versus adult-onset.[24]",
    "Society and culture": "Former Buffalo Bills quarterback Jim Kelly has  attracted recognition and research funding for Krabbe disease following the diagnosis of his son, Hunter, in 1997. Hunter Kelly died of the disease on August 5, 2005, at the age of eight.[citation needed] They created Hunter's Hope, a foundation that seeks to advance newborn screening, research, and treatments, and provides support to families of leukodystrophy children.[citation needed]\nIn 2016, Cove Ellis, a child from Georgia, United States, was diagnosed with the disease. Her family and local community has worked to raise awareness of the disease and helped pass \"Cove's Law\".[27]"

    "Disease": "Lafora disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Symptoms of Lafora disease begin to develop during the early adolescent years, and symptoms progress as time passes. Prior to this, there is generally no indication of the presence of the disease, though in a few cases, the disease presents as a learning disorder around five years of age.[11] In extremely rare cases, symptoms may not show at all until as late as the third decade of life, though these cases have slower progression than typical LD.[12] The most common feature of Lafora disease is seizures that have been reported mainly as occipital seizures and myoclonic seizures with some cases of generalized tonic-clonic seizures, atypical absence seizures, and atonic and complex partial seizures.[2][13] Other symptoms common with the seizures are drop attacks, ataxia, temporary blindness, visual hallucinations, and a quickly-developing and dramatic dementia.[4][13]\nOther common signs and symptoms associated with Lafora disease are behavioral changes due to the frequency of seizures.[14] Over time those affected with Lafora disease have brain changes that cause confusion, speech difficulties, depression, decline in intellectual function, impaired judgement and impaired memory.[14] If areas of the cerebellum are affected by seizures, it is common to see problems with speech, coordination, and balance in Lafora patients.[14]\nFor dogs that are affected with Lafora disease, common symptoms are rapid shuddering, shaking, or jerking of the canine's head backwards, high pitched vocalizations that could indicate the dog is panicking, seizures, and – as the disease progresses – dementia, blindness, and loss of balance.[15]\nWithin ten years of developing symptoms, life expectancy declines. People who advance to adulthood tend to lose their ability to do daily tasks by themselves, which can require comprehensive care. If their symptoms progress extremely quickly or at an early age, patients receive comprehensive care, which – besides medication – means support during daily activities both physically and mentally. [16][17]",
    "Diagnosis": "Lafora disease is diagnosed by conducting a series of tests by a neurologist, epileptologist (person who specializes in epilepsy), or geneticist. To confirm the diagnosis, an EEG, MRI, and genetic testing are needed.[14] A biopsy may be necessary as well to detect and confirm the presence of Lafora bodies in the skin.[14]",
    "Treatment": "There is no cure for Lafora disease with treatment being limited to controlling seizures through anti-epileptic and anti-convulsant medications.[29] The treatment is usually based on the individual's specific symptoms and the severity of those symptoms. Some examples of medications include valproate, levetiracetam, topiramate, benzodiazepines, or perampanel.[30] Although the symptoms and seizures can be controlled for a long period by using anti-epileptic drugs, the symptoms will progress and patients lose their ability to perform daily activities leading to the survival rate of approximately 10 years after symptoms begin.[30] Quality of life worsens as the years go on, with some patients requiring a feeding tube so that they can get the nutrition and medication they need in order to keep living, but not necessarily functioning.[30] Recently Metformin is approved for the treatment.[citation needed]",
    "Epidemiology": "All the reports that have been published on Lafora disease have shown that the overall prevalence of the disease is about 4 cases per million individuals around the world. Lafora disease is much more prevalent in countries that have higher cases of inbreeding. Usually, these locations are geographically or culturally more isolated from the world at large.[31]",
    "Society and culture": "There are patient organizations in the United States (Chelsea's Hope), Italy (Tempo Zero and A.I.L.A.), France (France Lafora), and Spain (AEVEL).\nChelsea's Hope began as a website in the fall of 2007 as a means to share Chelsea Gerber's story with her family and friends. As the Gerber family connected with others affected by Lafora, they formed a patient advocacy organization in September 2009. Chelsea's Hope Lafora Children Research Fund is an IRS 501(c)3 non-profit organization, EIN: 27-1008382. The mission of Chelsea's Hope is to improve the lives of those affected by Lafora Disease and help accelerate the development of treatments.[35]\nIn 2016, shortly before Chelsea's death, her mother Linda recorded a video sharing a day in their life.[36] From myoclonus to a feeding tube replacement, viewers can learn what it means to live with Lafora Disease."

    "Disease": "Langerhans cell histiocytosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "LCH provokes a non-specific inflammatory response, which includes fever, lethargy, and weight loss. Organ involvement can also cause more specific symptoms.",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is confirmed histologically by tissue biopsy. Hematoxylin-eosin stain of biopsy slide will show features of Langerhans Cell e.g. distinct cell margin, pink granular cytoplasm.[34] Presence of Birbeck granules on electron microscopy and immuno-cytochemical features e. g. CD1 positivity are more specific. Initially routine blood tests e.g. full blood count, liver function test, U&Es, bone profile are done to determine disease extent and rule out other causes.[35] Electron microscopy or immunohistochemistry (only one of the two is required) may be used to definitively diagnose Langerhans cell histiocytosis, in the presence of other pathologic and histologic qualities of the disease.[36]\nImaging may be evident in chest X-rays with micronodular and reticular changes of the lungs with cyst formation in advanced cases. MRI and High-resolution CT may show small, cavitated nodules with thin-walled cysts. MRI scan of the brain can show three groups of lesions such as tumourous/granulomatous lesions, nontumourous/granulomatous lesions, and atrophy. Tumourous lesions are usually found in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis with space-occupying lesions with or without calcifications. In non-tumourous lesions, there is a symmetrical hyperintense T2 signal with hypointense or hyperintense T1 signal extending from grey matter into the white matter. In the basal ganglia, MRI shows a hyperintense T1 signal in the globus pallidus.[37]\nAssessment of endocrine function and bone marrow biopsy are also performed when indicated.[38]",
    "Treatment": "Guidelines for management of patients up to 18 years with Langerhans cell histiocytosis have been suggested.[45][46][47][48][clarification needed] Treatment is guided by extent of disease. Solitary bone lesion may be amenable through excision or limited radiation, dosage of 5-10 Gy for children, 24-30 Gy for adults. However systemic diseases often require chemotherapy. Use of systemic steroid is common, singly or adjunct to chemotherapy. Local steroid cream is applied to skin lesions. Endocrine deficiency often require lifelong supplement e.g. desmopressin for diabetes insipidus which can be applied as nasal drop. Chemotherapeutic agents such as alkylating agents, antimetabolites, vinca alkaloids either singly or in combination can lead to complete remission in diffuse disease.[citation needed]",
    "Prognosis": "There is a general excellent prognosis for the disease as those with localized disease have a long life span. With multi-focal disease 60% have a chronic course, 30% achieve remission and mortality is up to 10%.[49] A full recovery can be expected for people who seek treatment and do not have more lesions at 12 and 24 months. However, 50% of children under 2 with disseminated Langerhans cell histiocytosis die of the disease. The prognosis rate decreases for patients who  experience lung involvement. Whereas patients with skin and a solitary lymph node involvement generally have a good prognosis.[50]\nAlthough there is a general  good prognosis for Langerhans cell histiocytosis, approximately 50% of patients with the disease are prone to various complications such as musculoskeletal disability, skin scarring and diabetes insipidus.[50]",
    "Epidemiology": "LCH usually affects children between 1 and 15 years old, with a peak incidence between 5 and 10 years of age.  Among children under the age of 10, yearly incidence is thought to be 1 in 200,000;[51] and in adults even rarer, in about 1 in 560,000.[52] It has been reported in elderly but is vanishingly rare.[53] It is most prevalent in Caucasians, and affects males twice as often as females.[54] In other populations too the prevalence in males is slightly more than in females.[55]\nLCH is usually a sporadic and non-hereditary condition but familial clustering has been noted in limited number of cases. Hashimoto-Pritzker disease is a congenital self-healing variant of Hand-Schüller-Christian disease.[56]"

    "Disease": "Laryngeal papillomatosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "A common symptom of laryngeal papillomatosis is a change in voice quality. More specifically, hoarseness is observed.[4][5] As a consequence of the narrowing of the laryngeal or tracheal parts of the airway, shortness of breath, chronic cough and stridor (i.e. noisy breathing which can sound like a whistle or a snore), can be present.[4][5] As the disease progresses, occurrence of secondary symptoms such as dysphagia, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, failure to thrive, and recurrent upper respiratory infections can be diagnosed.[4][5] The risk of laryngeal papillomatosis spreading to the lungs is higher in the juvenile-onset than the adult-onset.[3] In children, symptoms are usually more severe and often mistaken for manifestations of other diseases such as asthma, croup, or bronchitis. Therefore, diagnosis is usually delayed.[8][5]",
    "Causes": "Laryngeal papillomatosis is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, most frequently types 6 and 11,[13] although genotypes 16, 18, 31, and 33 have also been implicated.[7] HPV-11 is associated with more aggressive forms of papillomatosis, which may involve more distal parts of the tracheobronchial tree.[7] The mode of viral inoculation is hypothesized to vary according to the age of disease onset.[13][14] The presence of HPV in the respiratory tract does not necessarily result in the development of laryngeal papillomatosis. Other factors that could be involved include immunodeficiency or other similar infections. For example, laryngeal papillomatosis may become more aggressive due to the presence of certain viruses (e.g., herpes simplex virus, Epstein–Barr virus).[2]\nThe disease occurs in two forms, juvenile and adult papillomatosis, based on whether it develops before or after 20 years of age.[1][7] The juvenile form is generally transmitted through contact with a mother's infected vaginal canal during childbirth.[14] Less is known about transmission in the adult form of this disease, though oral sex has been implicated as a potential mode of transmission.[13][14] However, it is uncertain whether oral sex would directly transmit the virus[14] or activate the dormant virus that was transmitted at childbirth.[14][13]\nIn general, physicians are unsure why only certain people who have been exposed to the HPV types implicated in the disease develop laryngeal papillomatosis. In the case of the juvenile form of the disease, the likelihood of a child born of an infected mother developing laryngeal papillomatosis is low (between 1 in 231 to 1 in 400),[15] even if the mother's infection is active.[13] Risk factors for a higher likelihood of transmission at childbirth include the first birth, vaginal birth, and teenaged mother.[14][13]\nThree major risk factors affect the acquisition of the juvenile variant. These include:[16]",
    "Diagnosis": "Laryngeal papillomatosis can be diagnosed through visualization of the lesions using one of several indirect laryngoscopy procedures.[6][8] In indirect laryngoscopy, the tongue is pulled forward and a laryngeal mirror or a rigid scope is passed through the mouth to examine the larynx.[12][6] Another variation of indirect laryngoscopy involves passing a flexible scope, known as a fiberscope or endoscope, through the nose and into the throat to visualize the larynx from above.[12][8] This procedure is also called flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy.[12]\nThe appearance of papillomas has been described as multiple or rarely, single, white growths with a lumpy texture similar to cauliflower.[12][7] Papillomas usually present in the larynx, especially on the vocal folds and in the space above the vocal folds called the ventricles.[17][18][1] They can spread to other parts of the larynx and throughout the aerodigestive tract, from the mouth to the lower respiratory tract.[1][7][17] Spread to regions beyond the larynx is more common in children than adults.[17] Growths tend to be located at normal junctions in squamous and ciliated epithelium or at tissue junctions arising from injury.[1][17][18]\nA confirmatory diagnosis of laryngeal papillomatosis can only be obtained through a biopsy, involving microscopic examination and HPV testing of a sample of the growth.[7][6] Biopsy samples are collected under general anesthesia, either through direct laryngoscopy or fiberoptic bronchoscopy.[6][7]",
    "Treatment": "As of 2014, there was no permanent cure for laryngeal papillomatosis, and treatment options aimed to remove and limit the recurrence of the papillomas.[9] Repeated treatments are often needed because of the recurrent nature of the virus, especially for children, as the juvenile form of laryngeal papillomatosis often triggers more aggressive relapses than the adult form.[9][2][7][10] Between recurrences, voice therapy may be used to restore or maintain the person's voice function.[12]\nThe first line of treatment is surgery to remove papillomas.[7][10] Typically performed using a laryngeal endoscopy, surgery can protect intact tissues and the individual's voice, as well as ensure that the airway remains unobstructed by the disease.[2] However, surgery does not prevent recurrences and can lead to several serious complications.[9][7][10] Laser technology, and carbon dioxide laser surgery in particular, has been used since the 1970s for the removal of papillomas; however, laser surgery is not without its risks, and has been associated with a higher occurrence of respiratory tract burns, stenosis, severe laryngeal scarring, and tracheoesophagyeal fistulae.[9][2][7][10] Tracheotomies are offered for the most aggressive cases, where multiple debulking surgery failures have led to airways being compromised.[2][7] The tracheotomies use breathing tubes to reroute air around the affected area, thereby restoring the person's breathing function. Although this intervention is usually temporary, some people must use the tube indefinitely.[8] This method should be avoided if at all possible, since the breathing tube may serve as a conduit for the spread of the disease as far down as the tracheobronchial tree.[2][7]\nA microdebrider is a tool that can suction tissue into a blade, which then cuts the tissue. Microdebriders are gradually replacing laser technology as the treatment of choice for laryngeal papillomatosis, due to their ability to suction papillomas selectively while relatively sparing unaffected tissue.[2][10] In addition to the lower risk of complications, microdebrider surgery is also reportedly less expensive, less time-consuming, and more likely to give the person a better voice quality than the traditional laser surgery approaches.[10]\nFor about 20% of people, surgery is not sufficient to control their laryngeal papillomatosis, and additional nonsurgical and/or medical treatments are necessary.[7] As of 2015[update], these treatments alone are not sufficient to cure laryngeal papillomatosis, and can only be considered supplemental to surgery.[2] Some varieties of nonsurgical treatments include interferon, antiviral drugs (especially cidofovir, but also ribavirin and acyclovir), and photodynamic therapy.[9][2][7][10][12] The monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), bevacizumab, has shown promising result as an adjuvant therapy in the management of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis.[20][21]\nAlthough vaccines are normally used to prevent infections from happening, HPV vaccines can be used therapeutically (after the infection has occurred).[22][23]  For most patients, the HPV vaccine significantly increases the length of time needed between surgeries.[19][22][23]\nZopapogene imadenovec (Papzimeos) was approved for medical use in the United States in August 2025.[24]",
    "Prognosis": "The evolution of laryngeal papillomatosis is highly unpredictable and is characterized by modulation of its severity and variable rate of progression across individuals.[4][1] While instances of total recovery are observed, the condition is often persistent and lesions can reappear even after treatment.[8][1][11] Factors that might affect the clinical course of the condition include: the HPV genotype, the age at onset, the elapsed time between the diagnosis and first treatment in addition to previous medical procedures.[7][17][1] Other factors, albeit controversial, such as smoking or the presence of gastroesophageal reflux disease might also play a role in the progression of the disease.[17][3]\nThe papillomas can travel past the larynx and infect extralaryngeal sites.[4] In more aggressive cases, infection of the lungs can occur with progressive airway obstruction.[4][5] Although rare (less than 1% of people with laryngeal papillomatosis), transformation from a benign form to a malignant form is also observed.[4][5] Death can result from these complications (morbidity rate is around 1–2%).[4]",
    "Epidemiology": "Laryngeal papillomatosis is a rare disease with a bimodal distribution based on age of incidence.[1] The incidence, or number of new cases, of laryngeal papillomatosis cases is at approximately 4.3 cases per 100,000 children and 1.8 cases per 100,000 adults annually.[7][6][12][1] The incidence of laryngeal papillomatosis in children peaks before the age of 5, though the term juvenile papillomatosis refers to all cases occurring before the age of 20.[1][7] The incidence of adult laryngeal papillomatosis, which has an onset after the age of 20, peaks between the ages of 20 and 40.[7][1] While there are no gender differences in the incidence of laryngeal papillomatosis in children, adult laryngeal papillomatosis occurs more frequently in males than in females.[7][17][1] The incidence of laryngeal papillomatosis also varies according to factors such as socioeconomic status, such that higher rates are observed in groups having a lower socioeconomic status.[7]"

    "Disease": "Leber congenital amaurosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "LCA symptoms typically begin in the first few months of life, most commonly with involuntary twitching of the eye (nystagmus). Affected infants may show misaligned eyes when looking at something (strabismus), aversion to light (photophobia), and poke or rub at their eyes (Franceschetti's oculodigital sign).[9] Those with LCA invariably experience vision problems. Affected infants show decreased visual response to objects. Loss of visual acuity is severe, with affected individuals' vision ranging from 20/200 to 20/400.[note 1] Around a third of those affected completely lose perception of light.[10]\nAt an eye exam, the pupils may not respond normally to light. Some affected individuals have cloudy eyes (cataracts), and irregularly shaped corneas (keratoconus).[9] Retinal exams typically look normal, especially in the young, though retinal abnormalities can appear later in life.[10]\nAside from eye problems, children with LCA are typically healthy.[11]",
    "Causes": "LCA is a genetic disease and can be caused by pathogenic variants in at least 28 different genes.[12] Variants in three of these genes – IMPDH1, OTX2, and CRX – can cause LCA in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning inheriting a single copy of a pathogenic variant can result in disease. Variants in the remaining genes associated with LCA cause disease in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning one must inherit copies of the pathogenic variant from both parents to develop LCA.[12] Genes associated with LCA have a variety of roles in the development of the eye:[citation needed]\nPathogenic variants of any of these genes cause dysfunction in those associated processes, which leads to severe vision loss. Variants in DTHD1 and NMNAT1 also cause LCA, though these genes' roles in vision development are not yet known.[13]\nAmong the gene variants that cause LCA, CEP290 and GUCYD variants are the most common, each causing up to 20% of LCA cases. Other common variants are in CRB1 (around 10% of cases), RPE65 (up to 10%), AIPL1 (up to 8%), RDH12 (up to 5%), and RPGRIP1 (around 5%).[14] Around 25% of people with LCA do not have any of the known LCA-causing pathogenic gene variants; the cause of their LCA is unknown.[12]",
    "Diagnosis": "LCA is diagnosed clinically, by a combination of vision loss, an abnormal response of the pupils to light, and by abnormal response to electroretinography, a test that measures the electrical response of the retina to light.[10]",
    "Treatment": "One form of LCA, in patients with LCA2 bearing a mutation in the RPE65 gene, has been successfully treated in clinical trials using gene therapy. The results of three early clinical trials were published in 2008 demonstrating the safety and efficacy of using adeno-associated virus to deliver gene therapy to restore vision in LCA patients. In all three clinical trials, patients recovered functional vision without apparent side effects.[5][6][7][8] These studies, which used adeno-associated virus, have spawned a number of new studies investigating gene therapy for human retinal disease.[citation needed] On 19 December 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved voretigene neparvovec-rzyl (Luxturna), an adeno-associated virus vector-based gene therapy for children and adults with biallelic RPE65 gene mutations responsible for retinal dystrophy, including Leber congenital amaurosis. Patients must have viable retinal cells as a prerequisite for the intraocular administration of Luxturna.[15] Another recent trial from The OHSU Casey Eye Institute used CRISPR to treat LCA starting in 2020. The experimental treatment consisted in editing a mutation of the CEP290 gene, which provides instructions to create a protein that is critical for sight. Results were released in 2023 with 79% of the patients showing improvement in at least one of four measured outcomes.[16]\nFor those who cannot benefit from gene therapy, LCA treatment is supportive, and meant to facilitate living with visual impairment. Some benefit from vision aids such as glasses, magnifiers, and enhancers. Other resources helpful for those with visual impairment include educational programs, special education teachers, and service animals.[17]",
    "Epidemiology": "Around 2–3 out of every 100,000 people have LCA – an estimated 180,000 people worldwide.[18] LCA is a common cause of blindness in the young; around 20% of children in schools for the blind have LCA.[19]"

    "Disease": "Legg%E2%80%93Calv%C3%A9%E2%80%93Perthes disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The condition is most commonly found in children between the ages of 4 and 10. Common symptoms include pain in the hip, knee, or ankle (since hip pathology can cause pain to be felt in a normal knee or ankle), or in the groin; this pain is exacerbated by hip or leg movement, especially internal hip rotation (with the knee flexed 90°, twisting the lower leg away from the center of the body). The range of motion is reduced, particularly in abduction and internal rotation, and the patient presents with a limp. Pain is usually mild. Atrophy of thigh muscles may occur from disuse and an inequality of leg length. In some cases, some activity can cause severe irritation or inflammation of the damaged area, including standing, walking, running, kneeling, or stooping repeatedly for an extended period. In cases exhibiting severe femoral osteonecrosis, pain is usually a chronic, throbbing sensation exacerbated by activity[1]\nThe first signs are complaints of soreness from the child, which are often dismissed as growing pains, and limping or other joint guarding, particularly when tired. The pain is usually in the hip, but can also be felt in the knee (referred pain). In some cases, pain is felt in the unaffected hip and leg,[2] due to the children favoring their injured side and placing the majority of their weight on their \"good\" leg. It is predominantly a disease of boys (4:1 ratio). Perthes is generally diagnosed between 5 and 12 years of age, although it has been diagnosed as early as 18 months. Typically, the disease is only seen in one hip, but bilateral Perthes is seen in about 10% of children diagnosed.[3]",
    "Causes": "Perthes disease is a childhood hip disorder initiated by a disruption of blood flow to the head of the femur. Due to the lack of blood flow, the bone dies (osteonecrosis or avascular necrosis) and stops growing.[4]\nLegg believed the cause was impairment of blood supply to the femoral epiphysis, Calvé believed rickets, and Perthes deduced an infection possibly causing degenerative arthritis leads to LCP disease. Currently, a number of factors have been implicated, including heredity, trauma, endocrine dysfunction, inflammation, nutrition, and altered circulatory hemodynamics.[5]\nRisk factors are not limited to impaired and disproportionate growth, low birth weight, delayed skeletal maturity, short stature, systemic hormonal changes, and low economic index.[6] Although no one has identified the cause of Perthes disease, a reduction in blood flow to the joint is known.[4]\nThe disease is theorized to include the artery of the ligamentum teres femoris being constricted or even blocked too early, not allowing for time when the medial circumflex femoral artery takes over. The medial circumflex femoral artery is the principal source of blood supply to the femoral head. LCP disease is a vascular restrictive condition of idiopathic nature. Symptoms like femoral head disfigurement, flattening, and collapse occur typically between ages four and ten, mostly male children of Caucasian descent. Children affected by LCP disease often display uneven gait and limited range of motion, and they experience mild to severe pain in the groin area.[7] For example, a child may be six years old chronologically but may have grown only four years old in terms of bone maturity. The child may then engage in activities appropriate for a six-year-old child, but lacking the bone strength of an older child, these activities may lead to flattening or fracture of the hip joint. Genetics do not appear to be a determining factor, but a deficiency of blood factors with anticoagulant property used to disperse blood clots may lead to blockages in the vessels supplying the joint. A deficiency of protein C and protein S, which also act as blood anticoagulants, may also exist; if that were the case, their deficiency could cause clot formation in ligamentum teres femoris artery and hinder blood supply to the femoral head. However, no evidence of this has been found; over the years, many theories have been published, but none has stood up to professional research.[8]",
    "Diagnosis": "X-rays of the hip may suggest and/or verify the diagnosis. X-rays usually demonstrate a flattened, and later fragmented, femoral head. A bone scan or MRI may be useful in making the diagnosis in those cases where X-rays are inconclusive. Usually, plain radiographic changes are delayed six weeks or more from clinical onset, so bone scintigraphy and MRI are done for early diagnosis. MRI results are more accurate, i.e. 97–99% against 88–93% in plain radiography. If MRI or bone scans are necessary, a positive diagnosis relies upon patchy areas of vascularity to the capital femoral epiphysis (the developing femoral head).[11]",
    "Treatment": "The goals of treatment are to decrease pain, reduce the loss of hip motion, and prevent or minimize permanent femoral head deformity so that the risk of developing a severe degenerative arthritis as an adult can be reduced.[12] Assessment by a pediatric orthopaedic surgeon is recommended to evaluate risks and treatment options. Younger children have a better prognosis than older children.[13]\nThere is no high quality evidence to guide treatments, though a nationwide study (called a randomised controlled trial) has recently started throughout the UK, which could improve the evidence in future - called the OpNonSTOP study (see research direction). Until then, treatment decisions are based largely on case series and experience.\nTreatment has historically centered on removing mechanical pressure from the joint until the disease has run its course. Options include traction (to separate the femur from the pelvis and reduce wear), braces (often for several months, with an average of 18 months) to restore range of motion, physiotherapy, and surgical intervention when necessary because of permanent joint damage. To maintain activities of daily living, custom orthotics may be used. Overnight traction may be used in lieu of walking devices or in combination.[14]  These devices internally rotate the femoral head and abduct the leg(s) at 45°. Orthoses can start as proximal as the lumbar spine, and extend the length of the limbs to the floor. Most functional bracing is achieved using a waist belt and thigh cuffs derived from the Scottish-Rite orthosis.[15] These devices are typically prescribed by a physician and implemented by an orthotist. Clinical results of the Scottish Rite orthosis have not been good according to some studies, and its use has gone out of favor. Many children, especially those with the onset of the disease before age 6, need no intervention at all and are simply asked to refrain from contact sports or games which impact the hip. For older children (onset of Perthes after age 6), the best treatment option remains unclear. Current treatment options for older children over age 8 include prolonged periods without weight bearing, osteotomy (femoral, pelvic, or shelf), and the hip distraction method using an external fixator which relieves the hip from carrying the body's weight. This allows room for the top of the femur to regrow.[9]\nWhile running and high-impact sports are not recommended during treatment for Perthes disease, children can remain active through a variety of other activities that limit mechanical stress on the hip joint. Swimming is highly recommended, as it allows exercise of the hip muscles with full range of motion while reducing the stress to a minimum. Cycling is another good option as it also keeps stress to a minimum. Physiotherapy generally involves a series of daily exercises, with weekly meetings with a physiotherapist to monitor progress. These exercises focus on improving and maintaining a full range of motion of the femur within the hip socket. Performing these exercises during the healing process is essential to ensure that the femur and hip socket have a perfectly smooth interface. This will minimize the long-term effects of the disease. Use of bisphosphonate such as zoledronate or ibandronate is currently being investigated, but definite recommendations are not yet available.[16][17]\nPerthes disease is self-limiting, but if the head of femur is left deformed, long-term problems can occur. Treatment is aimed at minimizing damage while the disease runs its course, not at 'curing' the disease. It is recommended not to use steroids or alcohol as these reduce oxygen in the blood which is needed in the joint. As those affected age, problems in the knee and back can arise secondary to abnormal posture and stride adopted to protect the affected joint. The condition is also linked to arthritis of the hip, though this appears not to be an inevitable consequence. Hip replacements are relatively common as the already damaged hip experiences routine wear; this varies by individual, but generally is required any time after age 50.[18]",
    "Prognosis": "Children younger than six have the best prognosis, since they have time for the dead bone to revascularize and remodel, with a good chance that the femoral head will recover and remain spherical after resolution of the disease.[19] Children who have been diagnosed with Perthes' disease after the age of ten are at a very high risk of developing osteoarthritis and coxa magna. When an LCP disease diagnosis occurs after age eight, a better outcome results with surgery rather than nonoperative treatments.[20] Shape of femoral head at the time when Legg-Calvé Perthes disease heals is the most important determinant of risk for degenerative arthritis; hence, the shape of femoral head and congruence of hip are most useful outcome measures.[7]",
    "Epidemiology": "Perthes' disease is one of the most common hip disorders in young children, occurring in roughly 5.5 of 100,000 children per year. The lifetime risk of a child developing the disease is about one per 1,200 individuals. Boys are affected about three to five times more often than girls. New cases of Perthes' disease rarely occur after age 14 years (if diagnosed after 14 years of age, then it is usually old disease from early in childhood or avascular necrosis from an alternative cause).[6]\nWhite northern Europeans appear to be affected more frequently than other ethnicities, though a paucity of reliable epidemiology exists in the Southern Hemisphere.[21] Children of those with the disease themselves may have a very slightly increased risk, though it is unclear if this is because of a genetic predisposition, or a shared environmental factor. It is most commonly seen in persons aged three to twelve years, with a median of six years of age. [citation needed] The UK incidence rates show an intriguing pattern with low incidence rates in London, and a progressive increase in disease in more northerly areas (maximal in Scotland).[22] Some evidence suggests, at least in developed countries, more socioeconomically deprived communities have a greater risk of disease (a similar trend to diseases such as adult heart disease), though the reason for this remains unknown.[22][23][24][25][26][27] One possible explanation that has been considered is tobacco smoke exposure, though this is significantly confounded by the strong socioeconomic gradient common to both smoking and Perthes' disease.[6][28]"

    "Disease": "Letterer%E2%80%93Siwe disease",
    "Causes": "In general, the cause of Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis is unknown. Regardless of the subtype of Langerhans cell histiocytosis, the pathologic hallmark for all subtypes of LCH is the abnormal proliferation and accumulation of immature Langerhans cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, and eosinophils. The collection of these cells is what forms granulomatous lesions. Histiocytes, a type of white blood cell, are part of the body's immune system. When produced in excess, like in LCH and LSD, they attack the body's systems and cause the physical manifestations that are seen in these patients.[5]\nThere have been associated gene mutations linked to Abt-Letterer-Siwe disease. LSD, in addition to all forms of LCH, is an oncogene-driven cancer of myeloid lineage. Activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway is seen in all patients with LCH. In 50-60% of patients with LCH, oncogenic mutations of BRAFV600E are identified. 10-15% of patients have MAP2K1 mutations.[1]\nLSD has no clear association with hereditary or familial tendencies.[3]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosing Letterer-Siwe disease requires a complete work-up and examination because its symptoms are often non-specific and appear like other benign conditions. A diagnosis of LSD can be made with positive biochemical findings suggestive of LSD in addition to evidence of multi-organ involvement.[8] The diagnosis is established by biopsy. Pathology then uses immunohistochemical characteristics, such as cell surface markers CD1a, CD207, and S-100, to help identify the Langerhans cells. Because of the link LCH has to BRAFV600E and other MAPK pathway mutations, tumor tissue should be tested for associated mutations.[1]\nElectron microscopy will show racket-like Langerhans cell granules within the specific infiltrating cells. The demonstration of these organelles allows the unequivocal diagnosis in cases with uncharacteristic clinical or histopathological appearance. The same structures are characteristic of Hand-Schüller-Christian disease and of eosinophilic granuloma. The electron microscopic findings confirm the grouping of these three diseases together as \"histiocytosis X\".[citation needed]\nIn order to evaluate the degree of organ involvement in these patients, physicians may conduct a variety of diagnostic tests, such as",
    "Treatment": "Chemotherapy is indicated for patients with multisystem involvement. Patients who do not respond to even aggressive chemotherapy may consider reduced-intensity hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, experimental chemotherapy, or immunomodulatory therapy specific to any identified mutation. Patients with BRAFV600E mutations, for example, may be candidates for BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib.[1]\nEarly consultation with a dermatologist in patients with skin manifestations is key, as early diagnosis and treatment can be life-saving to patients with this often terminal disease.[3]",
    "Prognosis": "The disease is often rapidly fatal, with a five-year survival rate of 50%. Poor prognostic indicators include disseminated disease, age < 2 years, and the development of thrombocytopenia.[1] The involvement of risk organs, which include the liver, spleen, and organs of the hematopoietic system, also suggests a worse prognosis and significantly higher mortality rate.[1][2]\nThe most significant prognostic factor is a response to initial (6-12 weeks) therapy with vinblastine and steroids. This factor outweighs even age as a prognostic indicator.[2]\nFor infants, LSD is nearly always a fatal illness. Death may occur in-utero or within a few weeks of birth.[9]"

    "Disease": "Leukocyte adhesion deficiency",
    "Signs and symptoms": "LAD was first recognized as a distinct clinical entity in the 1970s. The classic descriptions of LAD included recurrent bacterial infections, defects in neutrophil adhesion, and a delay in umbilical cord sloughing. The adhesion defects result in poor leukocyte chemotaxis, particularly neutrophil, inability to form pus and neutrophilia.[3]\nIndividuals with LAD suffer from bacterial infections beginning in the neonatal period. Infections such as omphalitis, pneumonia, gingivitis, and peritonitis are common and often life-threatening due to the infant's inability to properly destroy the invading pathogens. These individuals do not form abscesses because granulocytes cannot migrate to the sites of infection.",
    "Causes": "Types of leukocyte adhesion deficiency include LAD1, LAD2, and LAD3. LAD1 is the most common.[4]\nPatients with LAD1 have an inherited molecular defect that causes a deficiency of the β-2 integrin subunit,[5] also called CD18, which is encoded by the ITGB2 gene found on chromosome 21. This subunit is involved in the formation of the β-2 integrins (LFA-1, integrin alphaXbeta2/CR4/p150,95, and Mac-1/CR3) by dimerization with different CD11 subunits.[6][7]\nMutations in the ITGB2 gene lead to absent, reduced, or aberrant CD18 protein expression, causing a lack of expression in the leukocyte membrane of the β-2 integrins. The main function of these proteins is to allow neutrophils to make their way out of the blood stream and into the infected tissues by adhering to different ligands expressed by the endothelium, e.g. ICAM-1. In LAD-I patients, neutrophils cannot extravasate and fight against bacteria in tissues. The bacteria can then proliferate, leading to symptomatic infection, which can spread unimpeded and cause serious injury to important tissues.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "Typically, diagnosis involves several preliminary tests of immune function, including basic evaluation of the humoral immune system and the cell-mediated immune system. A WBC differential will reveal extremely elevated levels of neutrophils (on the order of 6–10x normal) because they are unable to leave the blood vessels.\nIn the case of LAD-I, specific diagnosis is done by flow cytometry. This technique will reveal absent or reduced CD18 expression in the leukocyte membrane. Recently, prenatal diagnosis systems has been established, allowing an early detection of the disease.\nLAD-II diagnosis includes the study of different glycosylated forms of the transferrin protein. In LAD-III, as platelet function is also affected, this could be used to differentiate it from the other types.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Although patients can receive intensive antibiotherapy and even granulocyte transfusions from healthy donors, the only current curative therapy is the hematopoietic stem cell transplant.[8] However, progress has been made in gene therapy, an active area of research. Both foamyviral and lentiviral vectors expressing the human ITGB2 gene under the control of different promoters have been developed and have been tested so far in preclinical LAD-I models (such as CD18-deficient mice and canine leukocyte adhesion deficiency-affected dogs).[citation needed]",
    "Prognosis": "A 2009 study reported results from 36 children who had received a stem cell transplant. At the time of follow-up (median time 62 months), the survival rate was 75%.[9]",

    "Disease": "Leukocyte adhesion deficiency-1",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The main sign of the disease is life-threatening, recurrent bacterial or fungal soft tissue infections.

Other signs include delayed separation of the umbilical cord, periodontal disease, elevated neutrophils, and impaired wound healing, but not increased vulnerability to viral infections or cancer. Such patients have fever as the manifestation of infection, inflammatory responses are indolent.[citation needed]",

  {
    "Disease": "Leukodystrophy",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Some specific symptoms vary from one type of leukodystrophy to the next, but the vast majority of symptoms are shared as the causes for the disease generally have the same effects. Symptoms are dependent on the age of onset, which is predominantly in infancy and early childhood, although the exact time of onset may be difficult to determine. Hyperirritability and hypersensitivity to the environment are common, as well as some tell-tale physical signs including muscle rigidity and a backwards-bent head.[6] Botox therapy is often used to treat patients with spasticity.[7] Juvenile and adult onsets display similar symptoms including a decrease or loss in hearing and vision. While children do experience optic and auditory degeneration, the course of the disease is usually too rapid, causing death relatively quickly, whereas adults may live with these conditions for many years. In children, spastic activity often precedes progressive ataxia and rapid cognitive deterioration which has been described as intellectual disability.[8] Epilepsy is commonplace for patients of all ages.[9] More progressed patients show weakness in deglutition, leading to spastic coughing fits due to inhaled saliva. Classic symptomatic progression of juvenile X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is shown in the 1992 film, Lorenzo's Oil.[10]\nCourse and timetable are dependent on the age of onset with infants showing a lifespan of 2–8 years, juveniles 2–10 years and adults typically 10+ years. Adults typically see an extended period of stability followed by a decline to a vegetative state and death.[6] While treatments do exist, most are in the experimental phase and can only promise a halt in the progression of symptoms, although some gene therapies have shown some symptomatic improvement.[11] The debilitating course of the disease has led to numerous philosophical and ethical arguments over experimental clinical trials, patients' rights and physician-assisted suicide.[12]",
    "Causes": "While the more specific underlying causes of leukodystrophy are dependent upon the type, there are common pathophysiological patterns that can be seen amongst all types. First and foremost, leukodystrophy is a neurodegenerative disease that is always the result of both impairment and maintenance of myelin sheaths surrounding neuronal axons in the central nervous system as the result of a genetic mutation.[13] Myelin is a fatty white substance that acts as an electrical insulator and coats axons in order to speed up impulses (i.e., action potentials) traveling down the axon. Thus, the natural result of a loss of this substance is decreased efficiency in impulse propagation. As myelin is produced by oligodendrocytes (a type of glial cell) in the central nervous system, an easy place to look for the cause is a mutation or malfunctioning of these cells and in other glial cells.[citation needed]\nInherited forms of leukodystrophy are usually the result of an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, although dominant inheritance patterns are not unheard of, as in the case of adult-onset leukodystrophy.[14] This means that the affected allele is carried on an autosomal, or non-sex, chromosome and is masked by the dominant, unaffected phenotype. In other words, for an individual to inherit the leukodystrophy phenotype, he or she must carry two of the recessive, mutant alleles. Krabbe disease and metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) are two of such type. MLD is found on human chromosome 22 at position q13.31.[15] Another type of inherited leukodystrophy is X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD). As its name implies, this type of leukodystrophy is the result of a mutation found on the X-chromosome. It is also carried in a recessive pattern. The X chromosome is a sex chromosome, and since women have two \"chances\" of acquiring a normal X chromosome (one maternal x, one paternal x), and males only one chance (one maternal x), this disease is more likely to be seen in males than in females. The mutation resulting in adult-onset leukodystrophy is mapped at 5q23.[14]",
    "Diagnosis": "The degeneration of white matter, which reflects the degeneration of myelin, can be seen in a basic MRI and used to diagnose leukodystrophies of all types. T-1 and T-2 weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images are the most often used approach.[25] Electrophysiological and other kinds of laboratory testing can also be done. In particular, nerve conduction velocity is looked at to distinguish between leukodystrophy and other demyelinating diseases, as well as to distinguish between individual leukodystrophies. For example, individuals with X-ALD have normal conduction velocities, while those with Krabbe disease or metachromatic leukodystrophy have abnormalities in their conduction velocities.[25] Multigene sequencing panels for undifferentiated leukodystrophy are offered for rapid molecular diagnosis after genetic counselling.[citation needed]\nSpecific types of leukodystrophy include the following with their respective ICD-10 codes when available:[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "With many different types of leukodystrophy, with many causes, treatment therapies will vary for each type. Studies and clinical trials are seeking to find therapies for each of the different leukodystrophies. Stem cell transplants and gene therapy appear to be the most promising in treating all leukodystrophies, providing they take place as early as possible, prior to extensive neurological damage.\nFor hypomyelinating leukodystrophies, therapeutic research into cell-based therapies appears promising. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells and neural stem cells have been transplanted successfully and have shown to be healthy a year later. Fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity maps showed possible myelination in the region of the transplant.[26][needs update] Induced pluripotent stem cells, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, gene correction, and transplantation to promote the maturation, survival, and myelination of oligodendrocytes seem to be the primary routes for possible treatments.[26][needs update]\nFor three types of leukodystrophies (X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) and Krabbe Disease (globoid cell leukodystrophy - GLD), gene therapy using autologous hematopoietic stem cells to transfer the healthy copy of the disease-causing gene with lentiviral vectors has been shown to succeed and has been used in clinical trials for X-ALD and MLD.[11][27] The progression of X-ALD has been shown to be disrupted with hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy, although the proximal cause of arrested demyelination and the quantity of stem cells needed are unclear.[11] While there continues to be an accumulation of very long chain fatty acids in the brain, this seems not to be the immediate causal factor behind the disease, as gene therapy does not correct the accumulation.[11][needs update]\nFor those leukodystrophies that result from a deficiency of lysozyme enzymes, such as Krabbe disease, enzyme replacement therapy seems hopeful. However, enzyme delivery proves difficult, because the blood–brain barrier severely limits what can pass into the central nervous system.[11] Current gene therapy research for metachromatic leukodystrophy has been reviewed with an emphasis on ex vivo transplantation of genetically modified hematopoietic stem cells.[28][needs update]",
    "Epidemiology": "Currently, no research has shown a higher prevalence of most leukodystrophy types in any one place around the world. There is, however, a higher prevalence of Canavan disease in the Jewish population. One in 40 individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent are carriers of Canavan disease.[29] This extrapolates to roughly 2.5%. Additionally, due to their autosomal recessive inheritance patterns, there is no significant difference found between males and females for most types of leukodystrophy, including but not limited to metachromatic leukodystrophy, Krabbe disease, Canavan disease, and Alexander disease. The one exception to this is any type of leukodystrophy carried on a sex chromosome, such as X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, which is carried on the X-chromosome. Because of the inheritance pattern of X-linked diseases, males are more often affected by this type of leukodystrophy, while female carriers are often symptomatic, though not as severely affected as males.[30]",
    "Society and culture": "The United Leukodystrophy Foundation (ULF), incorporated in 1982, is a non-profit, voluntary health organization dedicated to funding cutting-edge research and to providing patients and their families with disease information and medical referrals.[34]\nCure MLD is a global network of patient advocates and nonprofits dedicated to helping families impacted by metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD).[35]\nThe MLD Foundation was co-founded by Dean and Teryn Suhr in 2001 after the diagnosis in 1995 of two of their daughters with MLD. MLD Foundation serves families and works with researchers, clinicians, regulators, payors, and policy-makers around the world on MLD, leukodystrophy, lysosomal, and rare disease issues.[36]\nThe Leukodystrophy Alliance works to promote awareness and quality of care for those with leukodystrophy.[37]\nJill Kelly and her husband, NFL quarterback Jim Kelly, founded Hunter's Hope Foundation to fund research after their son Hunter (1997–2005) was diagnosed with infantile Krabbe leukodystrophy.[38]\nMatthew and Michael Clark of Hull, UK had the condition. Both died, in 2013 and 2016 respectively.[citation needed] Their story was the subject of the Channel 4 documentary The Curious Case of the Clark Brothers.[39][40]\nAugusto and Michaela Odone founded The Myelin Project after their son, Lorenzo was diagnosed with Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD). The 1992 film, Lorenzo's Oil is a true story about a boy with Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD).[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "Leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Most frequently, people with LBSL have anomalies of the dorsal columns. They also frequently exhibit Cerebellar abnormality, abnormal speech, positive babinski sign, clumsiness with abnomral gait, weakness of distal muscles, dysmyelinating leukodystrophy, loss of ability to walk, progressive ataxia, progressive spasticity with spastic ataxia,  pyramidal tract dysfunction. Occasionally, patients may also experience decreased reflexes, increased level of lactate in CSF and in blood, cognitive decline, axonal peripheral neuropathy. In very rare cases, they might have absence of the speech, cerebellum and cerebral atrophy, double vision, flexion contractures of joints, deafness, hypoplasia of corpus callosum, diminished muscle tone, intellectual disability, nystagmus, optic nerve atrophy, slow eye movements, drooping upper eyelid, seizures.[5]",
    "Causes": "LBSL is caused by an abnormal variant on in the DARS2 gene.[7] 95% of cases are caused by compound heterozygous variants (compound heterozygous means two different mutated alleles that present at particular gene locus).[8][9]\nOne of the widespread variant is the splice site variant at the end 3'end of intron 2, because of the leaky nature of this splice variant, it ensures residual protein function.[7][10]",

  {
    "Disease": "Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Onset usually occurs in childhood, however some adult cases have been found.  Generally, physicians look for the symptoms in children.  Symptoms include cerebellar ataxia, spasticity, optic atrophy, epilepsy,[2] loss of motor functions, irritability, vomiting, coma,[3] and even fever has been tied to VWM.[4]  The neurological disorders and symptoms which occur with VWM are not specific to countries; they are the same all over the world.[5]  Neurological abnormalities may not always be present in those who experience onset as adults. Symptoms generally appear in young children or infants who were previously developing fairly normally.[citation needed]",
    "Causes": "VWM is a leukodystrophy which has unique biochemical abnormalities.[4]  A unique characteristic of VWM is that only oligodendrocytes and astrocytes are negatively affected while other glial cells and neurons seem to be unaffected. This is the central question behind VWM. The real reasons behind this behavior are unknown since the cells are in the brain and have been rarely studied. However, there is a theory which is generally accepted by most experts in the field. The main characteristic of these cells is the fact that they synthesize a lot of proteins. These cells produce a large amount of proteins from a small amount of precursors and so are constantly working and under a reasonable amount of stress. So with a mutation in eIF2B, slight increases in the amount of stress these cells encounter occur, making them more susceptible to failure due to stress.[5] The large amount of oligodendrocytes which display apoptotic characteristics and express apoptotic proteins suggests cell number reduction in the early stages of the disease.[2] Premature ovarian failure has also been associated with diminishing white matter.  However through an intensive survey, it was determined that even if an individual has premature ovarian failure, she does not necessarily have VWM.[6]\neIF2B is the guanine nucleotide-exchange factor for eIF2, and is composed of 5 subunits.  The largest subunit, eIF2B5 contains the most mutations for VWM.  eIF2B is a complex which is very involved with the regulation of in the translation of mRNA into proteins.[7] eIF2B is essential for the exchange of guanosine diphosphate(GDP) for guanosine-5'-triphosphate(GTP) in the initiation of translation via eIF2, because eIF2 is regenerated through this exchange. A decrease in eIF2B activity has been correlated with the onset of VWM.[8]  A common factor among VWM patients is mutations in the five subunits of eIF2B (21 discovered thus far),[7] expressed in over 60% of the patients.  These mutations lead to the decreased activity of eIF2B.  The most common mutation is R113H, which is the mutation of histidine to arginine. The homozygous form of the mutation is the least severe form.[5]  This mutation has also been documented in rodents, but they do not acquire VWM, while humans do.[7]  Another common mutation is G584A found in the eIF2B5 subunit.[9]  A correlation with stress has also been made, as eIF2B plays a central role in stress management – it is essential in down regulation protein synthesis in different stress conditions – and VWM patients are highly sensitive to stress.[8]  Protein eIF2B exists in all cells, and if this protein is reduced enough the cell will be negatively affected, and if it is reduced to zero, the cell will die. In affected cells, the protein is reduced to about 50%, which is acceptable for functionality in most cells, but not in glial cells since they synthesize a large amount of proteins constantly and need as many functioning proteins within them as possible. This would lower the baseline of the amount of stress a cell can handle, and thus in a stressed environment, it would have detrimental effects on these cells.[5]  Mutations in three of the subunits of eIF2B (2,4,&5) has been seen in both VWM and premature ovarian failure.[6]  The North American Cree population has also been found to have a distinctive mutation, R195H, which can lead to VWM.[7]  All patients who have been studied only have one mutation present in the gene, causing the eIF2B to still be active, which leads to VWM.  If two mutations occurred, then eIF2B activity would be stopped by the body.[10]",
    "Diagnosis": "Most diagnosis occurs in the early years of life around 2 to 6 years old.[3]   There have been cases in which onset and diagnosis have occurred late into adulthood.  Those with onset at this time have different signs, particularly the lack of cognitive deterioration.  Overall, detection of adult forms of VWM is difficult as MRI was not a common tool when they were diagnosed.[4]  Common signs to look for include chronic progressive neurological deterioration with cerebellar ataxia, spasticity, mental decline, decline of vision, mild epilepsy, hand tremor, the ability to chew and swallow food becomes difficult, rapid deterioration and fibrile infections following head trauma or fright, loss of motor functions, irritability, behavioural changes, vomiting, and even coma.  Those who go into coma, if they do come out usually die within a few years.[3] The diagnosis can be difficult if the physician does not take an MRI.[5]\nThe individual was examined at age 32, but he stated that he started noting differences 5 years before.  He noticed sexual impotency, social isolation, unexplained aggression and sadness, loss of motivation, inert laughs, auditory hallucinations, thought insertion, delusions, and imperative commenting.  He showed very minimal physical impairments, commonly seen in child-onsets.  However, his MRI showed characteristic signs of VWM disease.[12]\nThe MRI of patients with VWM shows a well defined leukodystrophy. These MRIs display reversal of signal intensity of the white matter in the brain. Recovery sequences and holes in the white matter are also visible.[5] Over time, the MRI is excellent at showing rarefaction and cystic degeneration of the white matter as it is replaced by fluid.  To show this change, displaying white matter as a high signal (T2-weighted), proton density, and Fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images are the best approach.  T2-weighted images also displaying cerebrospinal fluid and rarefied/cystic white matter.  To view the remaining tissue, and get perspective on the damage done (also helpful in determining the rate of deterioration) (T1-weighted), proton density, and FLAIR images are ideal as they show radiating stripe patterns in the degenerating white matter. A failure of MRI images is their ineffectiveness and difficulty in interpretation in infants since the brain has not fully developed yet. Though some patterns and signs may be visible, it is still difficult to conclusively diagnose. This often leads to misdiagnosis in infants particularly if the MRI results in equivocal patterns or because of the high water content in infants' brains. The easiest way to fix this problem is a follow-up MRI in the following weeks. A potentially similar appearance of MRI with white matter abnormalities and cystic changes may be seen in some patients with hypomelanosis of Ito, some forms of Lowe's (oculocerebrorenal) disease, or some of the mucopolysaccharidoses.[3]\nOften with VWM, the lack of knowledge of the disease causes a misdiagnosis among physicians.  As VWM is a member of the large group of leukodystrophy syndromes, it is often misdiagnosed as another type such as metachromatic leukodystrophy.  More often than not, it is simply classified as a non-specific leukodystrophy.[5]  The characteristics of the brain upon autopsy are often very similar to atypical diffuse sclerosis, such as the presence of fibrillary astrocytes and scant sudanophilic lipids.[3]  Adult-onset VWM disease can present with psychosis and may be hard to differentiate from schizophrenia.[12]  Common misdiagnosis from misinterpreting the MRI include asphyxia, congenital infections, metabolic diseases.[3]\nMultiple sclerosis is often a misdiagnosis, but only in children due to its neurological characteristics, onset in early years, and MRI abnormalities.[2]  However, there are many differences between the two diseases.  The glial cells express a loss of myelin. This loss of myelin is different from that seen in other diseases where hypomyelination occurs. In VWM, the cells never produce the normal amounts, whereas with diseases like MS, the cells' normal amounts are deteriorated. Also, with MS, the demyelination occurs due to inflammation, which is not the case in VWM.[5] Cell differences include a lower penetration of the macrophages and microglia, as well as the lack of T cells and B cells in VWM.[2]  Finally, patients with MS have widespread demyelination, but those with VWM only express demyelination in a localized area.[5]\nSome atypical forms of multiple sclerosis (multiple sclerosis with cavitary lesions) can be specially difficult to differentiate but there are some clues in MRI imaging that can help.[13]",
    "Treatment": "There are no treatments, only precautions which can be taken, mainly to reduce trauma to the head and avoiding physiological stress.[3] Melatonin has been shown to provide cytoprotective traits to glial cells exposed to stressors such as excitotoxicity and oxidative stress. These stressors would be detrimental to cells with a genetically reduced activity of protein eIF2B. However, research connecting these ideas have not been conducted yet.[5]",
    "Epidemiology": "Extensive pathological and biochemical tests were performed, however the cause was found by studying a small population in which mutations in the eIF2B gene were found.[11] No effective systemic studies have been conducted to determine the incidence around the world, but through the studies conducted thus far, it appears to be more prevalent in the white populations.[3] VWM appears to have a lower number of cases in the Middle East, and Turkey has not yet had a reported case.  Its prevalence is limited by the physician's ability to identify the disease.[5]  As of 2006, more than 200 people have been identified with VWM, many of whom were originally diagnosed with an unclassified leukodystrophy.[11]"

    "Disease": "Leydig cell hypoplasia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The symptoms of Leydig cell hypoplasia include pseudohermaphroditism, i.e., feminized, ambiguous, or relatively mildly underdeveloped (e.g., micropenis, severe hypospadias,[6] and/or cryptorchidism [undescended testes]) external genitalia, a female gender identity or gender variance, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (hypogonadism despite high levels of gonadotropins), delayed, impaired, or fully absent puberty with an associated reduction in or complete lack of development of secondary sexual characteristics (sexual infantilism), impaired fertility or complete sterility, tall stature (due to delayed epiphyseal closure), eunuchoid skeletal proportions, delayed or absent bone maturation, and osteoporosis.[2][3]",
    "Causes": "Leydig cell hypoplasia is caused by genetic mutations in LHCGR, a gene which encodes the LH/hCG receptor. LH normally acts through the LH/hCG receptor to stimulate the growth of Leydig cells in the testicles and the production of androgens such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by these cells. In Leydig cell hypoplasia however, there is a reduced capacity for the LH/hCG receptor to respond to LH. This results in hypoplasia or absence of Leydig cells, testicular atrophy, and lower than normal androgen levels. In the most severe form of the condition in which there is a complete lack of response of the Leydig cells to LH, androgen production by the testicles is virtually negligible and secondary sexual characteristics entirely fail to develop at puberty.[2][3][7][8][9]",
    "Diagnosis": "Since the Sertoli cells are not affected by Leydig cell hypoplasia, anti-Müllerian hormone is secreted normally and so there are no Müllerian structures. Wolffian structures, such as the prostate, vasa deferentia, and epidydimides are present. In type I, abdominal testes are revealed on ultrasound; in type II testes may be descended or undescended.[citation needed]\nPeople with Leydig cell hypoplasia type I display no response to the hCG stimulation test; there is no increase in serum levels of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone.[10] Leydig cell hypoplasia type II can display either a pronounced rise of testosterone levels or no rise. [citation needed]\nIn any case, the diagnosis is confirmed on biopsy of the testes, revealing either absent or hypoplastic Leydig cells. The inside of the testis will be grayish and mucous, displaying arrested spermatogenesis and the presence of Sertoli cells.[11] The diagnosis can also be confirmed by looking for mutations in the gene for the LH receptor.[12]\nA diagnosis of Leydig cell hypoplasia is usually made in the neonatal period, following the discovery of ambiguous genitalia, or at puberty, when secondary sex characteristics fail to develop. Puberty is the most common time for Leydig cell hypoplasia to be diagnosed.[11][13]",
    "Treatment": "Patients with Leydig cell hypoplasia may be treated with hormone replacement therapy (i.e., with androgens), which will result in normal sexual development and the resolution of most symptoms. In the case of 46,XY (genetically \"male\") individuals who are phenotypically female and/or have a female gender identity, estrogens are recommended instead. Surgical correction of the genitals in individuals with male gender identity may be required, and, if necessary, an orchidopexy (relocation of the undescended testes to the scrotum) may be performed as well.[3]"

The ulcer develops very quickly, and is usually preceded by sudden onset of fever and malaise.[11]",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is mainly clinical and centred in eliminating other more common causes for vulvar ulcers. Nevertheless, it has been proposed that Epstein-Barr detection using polymerase chain reaction for virus genome can help to reach sooner a diagnosis.[7]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment is symptomatic, and usually of little value; in most cases, the ulcer heals spontaneously within four to six weeks, sometimes leaving scars. Topical analgesics and anesthetics, as well as topical application of disinfectants/astringents such as potassium permanganate (in sitz baths), is commonly used.[11] In severe cases, a combination of systemic glucocorticoids and broad-spectrum antibiotics has been recommended.[citation needed]",

    "Disease": "Loeys%E2%80%93Dietz syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "There is considerable variability in the phenotype of Loeys–Dietz syndrome, from mild features to severe systemic abnormalities. The primary manifestations of Loeys–Dietz syndrome are arterial tortuosity (winding course of blood vessels), widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), wide or split uvula, and aneurysms at the aortic root. Other features may include cleft palate and a blue/gray appearance of the white of the eyes. Cardiac defects and club foot may be noted at birth.[7]\nThere is overlap in the manifestations of Loeys–Dietz and Marfan syndromes, including increased risk of ascending aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection, abnormally long limbs and fingers, and dural ectasia (a gradual stretching and weakening of the dura mater that can cause abdominal and leg pain). Findings of hypertelorism (widely spaced eyes), bifid or split uvula, and skin findings such as easy bruising or abnormal scars may distinguish Loeys–Dietz from Marfan syndrome.[citation needed]\nAffected individuals often develop immune system related problems such as allergies to food, asthma, hay fever, and inflammatory disorders such as eczema or inflammatory bowel disease.[citation needed]\nFindings of Loeys–Dietz syndrome may include:[citation needed]",
    "Causes": "Several genetic causes of Loeys–Dietz syndrome have been identified. A de novo mutation in TGFB3, a ligand of the TGF β pathway, was identified in an individual with a syndrome presenting partially overlapping symptoms of Marfan syndrome and Loeys–Dietz syndrome.[8]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis involves consideration of physical features and genetic testing. Presence of split uvula is a differentiating characteristic from Marfan syndrome, as well as the severity of the heart defects. Loeys–Dietz syndrome patients have more severe heart involvement and it is advised that they be treated for enlarged aorta earlier due to the increased risk of early rupture in Loeys–Dietz patients. Because different people express different combinations of symptoms and the syndrome was first identified in 2005, many doctors may not be aware of its existence.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "As there is no known cure, Loeys–Dietz syndrome is a lifelong condition. Due to the high risk of death from aortic aneurysm rupture, patients should be followed closely to monitor aneurysm formation, which can then be corrected with vascular surgery. Previous research in laboratory mice has suggested that the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan, which appears to block TGF-beta activity, can slow or halt the formation of aortic aneurysms in Marfan syndrome. A large clinical trial sponsored by the National Institutes of Health is currently underway to explore the use of losartan to prevent aneurysms in Marfan syndrome patients. Both Marfan syndrome and Loeys–Dietz syndrome are associated with increased TGF-beta signaling in the vessel wall. Therefore, losartan also holds promise for the treatment of Loeys–Dietz syndrome. In those patients in which losartan is not halting the growth of the aorta, irbesartan has been shown to work and is currently also being studied and prescribed for some patients with this condition.[citation needed]\nIf an increased heart rate is present, a cardioselective beta-1 blocker, with or without losartan, is sometimes prescribed to reduce the heart rate to prevent any extra pressure on the tissue of the aorta. Likewise, strenuous physical activity is discouraged in patients, especially weight lifting and contact sports.[9]",
    "Epidemiology": "The incidence of Loeys–Dietz syndrome is unknown; however, Type 1 and 2 appear to be the most common.[6]"

  {
    "Disease": "Lutembacher%27s syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "As Lutembacher's syndrome is known for ASD and MS, most of the symptoms experienced will be associated with ASD and MS. For most people, they will remain asymptomatic (experience no symptoms) but when symptoms are shown, they are due mainly to ASD and will vary depending on the size of the hole in the atria. If the patient has a large ASD, pulmonary congestion (blood or fluid buildup in the lungs) will happen later but if the patient has a small ASD, symptoms will appear early in the disorder. In general, unless the ASD and mitral stenosis causing Lutembacher's syndrome is severe, symptoms may not appear until the second and third decade of the patient's life.[citation needed] As many of the patients are asymptomatic and symptoms may not appear until later in life, the duration or frequency of the symptoms varies. For symptoms such as palpitations, ventricular overload, heart failure, and pulmonary congestion, these symptoms may be sudden and not that frequent as they are very severe symptoms. For symptoms such as loud mitral S1, pulmonary S2, mid-diastolic murmur, fatigue, reduced exercise tolerance, weight gain, ankle edema, and right upper quadrant pain, and ascities, these symptoms may be less frequent and severe; their duration may be only a few seconds, minutes, or even months.[citation needed]\nMajor symptoms of Lutembacher's syndrome as a result of ASD and MS can range from heart failure to pulmonary congestion.[citation needed]",
    "Causes": "Lutembacher is caused indirectly by heart damage or disorders. Lutembacher's syndrome is caused by either birth defects where the heart fails to close all holes in the walls between the atria or from an episode of rheumatic fever where damage is done to the heart valves such as the mitral valve and resultant in an opening of heart wall between atria. With Lutembacher's syndrome, a fetus or infant is usually seen to have a hole in their heart wall (interatrial) separating their right and left atria.[7]  Normally during fetal development, blood bypasses the lungs and is oxygenated from the placenta. Blood passes from the umbilical cord and flows into the left atrium through an opening called the foramen ovale; the foramen ovale is a hole between the two atria.[7] Once a baby is born and the lungs begin to fill with air and the blood flow of the heart changes, a tissue flap (somewhat like a trap door) called the septum primum closes the foramen ovale or hole between the two atria and becomes part of the atrial wall. The failure of the hole between the two atria to close after birth leads to a disorder called ASD primum.[7] The most common problems with an opening found in the heart with Lutembacher's syndrome is Ostium Secundum. Ostium Secundum is a hole that is found within the flap of tissue (septum primum) that will eventually close the hole between the two atria after birth. With either type of ASD, ASD will usually cause the blood flow from the right atrium to skip going to the right ventricle and instead flow to the left atrium. If mitral stenosis (the hardening of flap of tissue known as a valve which opens and closes between the left atrium and ventricle to control blood flow) is also present, blood will flow into the right atrium through the hole between the atria wall instead of flowing into the left ventricle and systemic circulation.[1][7] Eventually this leads to other problems such as the right ventricle failing and a reduced blood flow to the left ventricle.[1]\nIn addition to the ASD, MS can either be acquired (present either from an episode of rheumatic fever or the mother has or had rheumatic fever during the pregnancy) or congenital (the child being born with the disorder). With the combination of both ASD and MS, the heart can be under severe strain as it tries to move blood throughout the heart and lungs.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "Lutembacher's syndrome is diagnosis primarily by physical examinations for heart sounds, electrocardiograms, chest radiogram, transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography, color flow mapping, and Doppler imaging. Use of the various test can help to differentiate other possible conditions such as mitral regurgitation, Ebstein disease, ventricular septal defect (VSD).[9]\nA physical examination will be done to check for abnormal heart sounds, condition of heart, blood pressure, lungs, palpitations, edema, weight gain, ascites, or any other abnormal symptoms. Blood may also be drawn to help determine the cause of fatigue, determination of ascites, other health problems that maybe closely related to cause the symptoms such as kidney, liver, immune (signs of rheumatic fever), abnormal glucose levels.[citation needed]\nElectrocardiogram (ECG) is used for determination of the location, size, direction of blood flow through the atrial hole, hemodynamic of the right ventricle (blood circulation), tricuspid valve, and functioning of left ventricle. The ECG can also be used to determine the rhythm of the heart to determine if there is an indication of sinus rhythm or atrial fibrillation. In the ECG, the p wave morphology will be study for any abnormalities. If during the ECG, the P-wave (atrial depolarization) is tall, broad, or split waves in lead II and accompanied with a deep negative force in V1, this would be considered to be abnormal; only one wave should be associated with the P-wave. Additionally, in an ECG the QRS morphology and axis will be examined for any abnormalities. If the ECG shows a right axis deviation which is abnormal or a right bundle-branch block (this would mean there was no signal going through the atrium to instruct the ventricle to contract or squeeze blood out of the ventricle).[9]\nA chest radiogram can be given to a patient to determine:[citation needed]\nTransthoracic or Transesophageal echocardiography two dimensional images that can be made of the heart. They can be used to determine the stages of Lutembacher's syndrome. They are used to determine:\nA color flow and doppler imaging is used to help confirm the presence as well as evaluate the severity of ASD and MS.[9]\nA chest x-ray will be given to determine the size of the heart and the blood vessels supplying blood to the lungs.[10]\nCardiac catheterization is done to confirm a diagnosis; it is not routinely done prior. It can also be used to evaluate the severity of ASD and measure the mitral valve area. To determine the presence ASD, a catheter is passed through the suspected hole between the atrium into the left atrium.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "To treat Lutembacher's syndrome, the underlying causes of the disorder must first be treated: mitral stenosis and atrial septal defect. Lutembacher's syndrome is usually treated surgically with treatments such as:[citation needed]\nPercutaneous transcatheter treatment for the MS can include transcatheter therapies of such as balloon valvuloplasty.\nPercutaneous transcatheter therapy is used to repair the mitral valve and sometimes the septum. In percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty, using a catheter, a ballon such as the Inoue ballon is placed into blood vessels in the groin area and the balloon guided to the heart. If a hole is not already present, a small hole may need to be inserted the atria and inserted into the mitral valve through the left atrium; the balloon is then inflated. The balloon inside the mitral valve will be inflated and deflated several times to wide the valve opening until the opening is satisfactory; the balloon will then be deflated and removed.[2][11]\nThe advantage to using percutaneous procedures instead of open-heart surgery is not needing general anesthesia, blood transfusions, and the recovery time is quicker. The drawback to this procedure is the lack of repeating and transseptal procedures if they are needed later. Also if the patient later develops a relapse of MS, surgery will need to be performed where using more evasive techniques.[2] Additionally, if a hole is needed to be inserted into the atria to obtain access to the mitral valve, there is a risk of developing ASD secondarily.[2]\nPossible side effects from this non-invasive procedure could be:[citation needed]\nIf any of the above symptoms occur, it is important to contact your doctor to prevent another lapse of mitral stenosis. To ensure good health, routine doctors visits, diet, weight loss, doctor-approved exercise, and use of antibiotics in dental and other procedures are recommended.[11]\nTo treat ASD a device closure can be used. In fact an ASD closure is often recommended for certain cases such as with a patient who has significant left-to-right shunt with a pulmonary and/or systemic flow fraction of Qp/Qs >1.5. It is best to perform this procedure/surgery between the ages of 2–4 years.[citation needed] The closure is done by two methods: interventionally or surgically.[citation needed]\nThis procedure is done by placing a device such as Amplatzer \"umbrella\", CardioSEAL similar to percutaneous transcatheter therapy. A catheter is inserted in the vessels and threaded to the heart and inserted into the ASD closing the defect.[citation needed] Other closure device that have been used is the GORE HELEX Septal Occluder.[10] After the device has been inserted and covers the defect, over time tissue will grow over the implant device to make it become part of the heart. Anticoagulant medication will be given to the patient for the first six months following the surgery: aspirin, clopidogrel or warfarin (Coumadin).[10]\nThis procedure is done through open heart surgery (sternotomy or thoracotomy) using an ECC where the heart is stopped to allow a system of special cannulas to be placed. The hole is closed by a direct suture (sewing) if the hole is small enough or if the hole is larger, suturing (sewing) a small patch of pericardium (heart tissue or skin) or fabric to close the hole.[citation needed]\nTo increase quality life following ASD procedures/surgeries, patients should have a physical exam and ECG every 3, 6, and 12 months with their cardiologist.[10] For many patients with secundum ASD closure repair, they can return to their normal activities unless their procedure was heart catheterization which in this case they should rest for a few days.[10][12] All patients should remain on blood thinner medication for at least 6 months and up to a year unless the patient had a stroke in which they would always be on blood thinners.[10][12] Patients with coronary artery disease or pulmonary hypertension will take additional medicines described by their physician. For patients who had heart surgery to repair the defect or received a transcatheter closure device, they will need to take some form of antibiotics to prevent infections such as endocarditis for at least 6 months following the procedure.[10][12]\nSuccess with ASD closure is very high, 96% for percutaneous procedures and 100% of ASD surgeries as found by one research group.[12] No patient was found to have died from either interventional or surgical treatments and only 7.2% of patients\nwho received a device and 24.0% of patients who had surgery had complications. The hospital stay for each group also varied, the surgical group was 3.4 ± 1.2 days and device group 1.0 ± 0.3 days.[12] As seen by this study, prognosis was good and quality of life could be excellent.[citation needed]\nSide effects with interventional device closure have not been extensively supported as yet.[12]\nPossible side effects from the ASD device closure procedure could be:[citation needed]\nWith surgically closure, the normal risk of infection, fevers, and blood clots are among the risks. If any signs of infection such as swelling, pain, or fever are present, the patient should seek medical attention. Patients who have ASD repaired later in life are also at a higher risk of developing atrial fibrillation especially if the device is not stable.[12]"

    "Disease": "Lymphangioleiomyomatosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The average age of onset is the early-to-mid-30s.[3][4][5][6] Exertional dyspnea (shortness of breath) and spontaneous pneumothorax (lung collapse) have been reported as the initial presentation of the disease in 49% and 46% of patients, respectively.[6]\nDiagnosis is typically delayed 5 to 6 years.[3][4][5][6] The condition is often misdiagnosed as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The first pneumothorax, or lung collapse, precedes the diagnosis of LAM in 82% of patients.[7][8] The consensus clinical definition of LAM includes multiple symptoms:[citation needed]\nLung destruction in LAM is a consequence of diffuse infiltration by neoplastic smooth muscle-like cells that invade all lung structures including the lymphatics, airway walls, blood vessels and interstitial spaces.[15] The consequences of vessel and airway obstruction include chylous fluid accumulations, hemoptysis, airflow obstruction and pneumothorax. The typical disease course displays progressive dyspnea on exertion, spaced by recurrent pneumothoraces and in some patients, chylous pleural effusions or ascites.[16]\nMost people have dyspnea on exertion with daily activities by 10 years after symptom onset. Many patients require supplemental oxygen over that interval.[7]",
    "Diagnosis": "LAM can come to medical attention in several ways, most of which trigger a chest CT. Thin-walled cystic change in the lungs may be found incidentally on CT scans of the heart, chest or abdomen (on the cuts that include lung bases) obtained for other purposes. HRCTs of TSC patients reveals that about 20% of women have cystic change by age 20 and about 80% of women have cystic changes after age 40.[79] LAM is sometimes revealed by chest CT in patients who present with an apparent primary spontaneous pneumothorax, but more often CT scanning is not ordered (in the United States) until recurrences occur. Progressive dyspnea on exertion without the exacerbations and remissions that are characteristic of asthma or COPD sometimes prompt a chest CT. A review of the CT by an expert familiar with LAM may increase diagnostic accuracy.[80] Chylothorax can also bring LAM to attention.\nIn some cases, a LAM diagnosis can be made with confidence on clinical grounds (without biopsy) in patients with typical cystic changes on high resolution CT scanning of the lung and findings of tuberous sclerosis, angiomyolipoma, lymphangioleiomyoma, chylothorax or serum VEGF-D > 800 pg/ml.[70][81]\nIf none of these clinical features are present, a biopsy may be necessary to make the diagnosis. Video-assisted thoracoscopic lung biopsy is the most definitive technique, but transbronchial biopsy has a yield of over 50% and can also be effective.[82][83] The safety of the latter procedure in patients with diffuse cystic disease and the profusion of cystic change that predicts an informative biopsy are incompletely understood, however. Cytology of chylous fluids, aspirated abdominal nodes or lymphatic masses can also be diagnostic.[63][84][85][86]\nDiagram 1 outlines a proposed algorithm for the diagnosis of LAM.[citation needed]\nThe chest radiograph may appear relatively normal, even late in the disease, or may suggest hyperinflation only. As the disease progresses, the chest radiograph often demonstrates diffuse, bilateral and symmetric reticulonodular opacities, cysts, bullae or a \"honeycomb\" (i.e., pseudo fibrotic) appearance.[3][6] Pleural effusion and pneumothorax may be apparent. Preservation of lung volumes in the presence of increased interstitial markings is a radiographic hallmark of LAM that helps distinguish it from most other interstitial lung diseases, in which alveolar septal and interstitial expansion tend to increase the lung's elastic recoil properties and decreased lung volumes.[citation needed]\nThe high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) chest scan is better than the chest radiograph to detect cystic parenchymal disease and is almost always abnormal at the time of diagnosis, even when the chest radiograph and pulmonary function assessments are normal.[3][5][6][87] The typical CT shows diffuse round, bilateral, thin-walled cysts of varying sizes ranging from 1 to 45 mm in diameter.[5][6] The numbers of cysts varies in LAM from a few to almost complete replacement of normal lung tissue. The profusion of cysts tends to be milder in patients with TSC-LAM than S-LAM, perhaps explained in part because TSC-LAM patients typically receive earlier screening.[11] Pleural effusions are seen on CT in 12% of patients with S-LAM and 6% of patients with TSC-LAM. Other CT features include linear densities (29%), hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy (9%), pneumothorax, lymphangiomyoma, and thoracic duct dilation.[5][6] Ground-glass opacities (12%) suggest the presence of interstitial edema due to lymphatic congestion. In patients with TSC, nodular densities on HRCT may represent multifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia (MMPH) made up of clusters of hyperplastic type II pneumocytes.[79][88][89] MMPH may be present in males or females with TSC in the presence or absence of LAM, but not in patients with S-LAM.[90] MMPH is not typically associated with physiologic or prognostic consequences, but one case of respiratory failure due to MMPH has been reported.[91][92][93]\nIn one study ventilation-perfusion scans were abnormal in 34 of 35 LAM patients.[5] The most common abnormality was nonspecific diffuse heterogeneity, usually grossly matched. These authors also described an \"unusual,\" \"speckling pattern\" on the perfusion images in 74% of patients, consisting of \"small, often peripheral collections of radioisotope.\"[citation needed]\nLAM and AML lesions do not typically exhibit increased uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose on positron emission tomography (PET) scanning.[94][95] Other neoplasms (or sources of inflammation) should therefore be considered in known or suspected LAM cases in which FDG-PET results are positive.[96]\nAbnormalities on abdominal imaging, such as renal AML and enlarged lymphatic structures, are also common in LAM. Fat density within a renal mass is pathognomonic of AMLs. AMLs are more prevalent and more frequently bilateral and large in patients with TSC-LAM than in patients with S-LAM. AML size correlates with the prevalence of pulmonary cysts in patients with TSC.[9] One study CT imaged 256 patients with S-LAM and 67 with TSC-LAM. Renal AMLs were present in 32% of patients with S-LAM and 93% of patients with TSC-LAM. Hepatic AMLs were present in 2% of patients with S-LAM and 33% of patients with TSC-LAM. Ascites was uncommon, seen in fewer than 10% of patients with LAM. Abdominal lymphangiomatosis, often containing both cystic and solid components, were seen in 29% of patients with S-LAM and 9% of patients with TSC-LAM.[11]\nCentral nervous system abnormalities, such as cortical or subependymal tubers and astrocytomas, are common in patients with TSC, including those with TSC-LAM, but are not found in women with S-LAM. Moss and associates[97] reported that women with S-LAM and TSC-LAM may have an increased incidence of meningioma, but the significance of that finding has been challenged.[98]\nPulmonary function testing in patients with LAM may be normal or may reveal obstructive, restrictive or mixed patterns. Obstructive physiology is the most common abnormality. Quality-controlled lung function data were collected prospectively by the NHLBI Registry, a five-year study of patients with LAM in centers around the United States. Spirometry revealed obstructive changes in about 57% of patients and normal results in 34%.[10] Restriction, defined as a total lung capacity less than the lower limit of normal, was seen in 11%. Hyperinflation was present in about 6%. The average residual volume was 125% of predicted when measured by plethysmography, but was only 103% of predicted determined with gas dilution methods, suggesting significant air trapping in noncommunicating airspaces. Approximately 25% of patients with obstructive physiology may demonstrate bronchodilator responsiveness but may be less in more severe obstruction.[99][100] The obstructive physiologic defect in LAM is primarily attributable to airflow obstruction.[101] The earliest change in initial pulmonary function testing in various case series was abnormal gas transfer, as assessed by the diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), described in 82% to 97% of patients.[3][4][6] It is not unusual for DLCO to be reduced out of proportion to forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1).[99] Reduction in DLCO and increase in residual volume are generally considered to be LAM's earliest physiologic manifestations.[citation needed]\nCardiopulmonary exercise testing in a much larger cohort of patients with LAM revealed a reduced maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) and anaerobic threshold in 217 patients.[102][103] Exercise-induced hypoxemia was found even in patients who did not have resting abnormalities in FEV1 and DLCO. In most patients, exercise was thought to be ventilation limited, owing to airflow obstruction and increased dead-space ventilation.[citation needed]\nDisease progression is usually accompanied by a progressive obstructive ventilatory defect. Decline in FEV1 is the most commonly used parameter to monitor disease progression. Although resting pulmonary hypertension appears to be unusual in LAM, pulmonary arterial pressure often rises with low levels of exercise, related in part to hypoxemia.[103] One study reported an increase in intraparenchymal shunts in dyspneic patients with LAM, which may contribute to resting and exercise hypoxemia.[104]\nGrossly, LAM lungs are enlarged and diffusely cystic, with dilated air spaces as large as several centimeters in diameter.[105][106] Microscopic examination of the lung reveals foci of smooth muscle-like cell infiltration of the lung parenchyma, airways, lymphatics, and blood vessels associated with areas of thin-walled cystic change. LAM lesions often contain an abundance of lymphatic channels, forming an anastomosing meshwork of slit-like spaces lined by endothelial cells. LAM cells generally expand interstitial spaces without violating tissue planes but have been observed to invade the airways, the pulmonary artery, the diaphragm, aorta, and retroperitoneal fat, to destroy bronchial cartilage and arteriolar walls, and to occlude the lumen of pulmonary arterioles.[105]\nThere are two major cell morphologies in the LAM lesion: small spindle-shaped cells and cuboidal epithelioid cells.[107] LAM cells stain positively for smooth muscle actin, vimentin, desmin, and, often, estrogen and progesterone receptors. The cuboidal cells within LAM lesions also react with a monoclonal antibody called HMB-45, developed against the premelanosomal protein gp100, an enzyme in the melanogenesis pathway.[107] This immunohistochemical marker is very useful diagnostically, because other smooth muscle-predominant lesions in the lung do not react with the antibody.[108] The spindle-shaped cells of the LAM lesion are more frequently proliferating cell nuclear antigen positive than the cuboidal cells, consistent with a proliferative phenotype.[107] Compared with cigar-shaped normal smooth muscle cells, spindle-shaped LAM cells contain less abundant cytoplasm and are less eosinophilic. Estrogen and progesterone receptors are also present in LAM lesions,[109][110][111] but not in adjacent normal lung tissue.[112] LAM lesions express lymphatic markers LYVE-1, PROX1, podoplanin and VEGFR-3. The smooth muscle-like cells of AMLs are morphologically and immunohistochemically similar to LAM cells, including reactivity with antibodies directed against actin, desmin, vimentin, and HMB-45 as well as estrogen and progesterone receptors.[113][114] Unlike the dilated airspaces in emphysema, the cystic spaces found in LAM may be partially lined with hyperplastic type II cells.[115]",
    "Treatment": "An FDA-approved drug for treatment of LAM, the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus, is available for stabilization of lung function decline.[35] Lung transplantation remains the last resort for patients with advanced disease.[116]\nPneumothoraces in LAM patients tend to recur, especially after conservative management such as observation, aspiration or simple tube thoracostomy. Over 65% of LAM patients develop pneumothorax during the course of their illness, averaging 3.5 pneumothoraces in those who have at least one pneumothorax.[8] The LAM Foundation Pleural Consensus Group advocated the use of a pleural symphysis procedure with the first pneumothorax, given the greater than 70% chance of recurrence.[8] Chemical sclerosis, mechanical abrasion, talc poudrage and pleurectomy have been effective in patients with LAM, but mechanical abrasion is preferred for those who may require pulmonary transplantation in the future. About half of LAM patients who have undergone transplant have had a prior pleurodesis procedure, and more than 75% of those had had prior bilateral pleurodesis.[8] Although pleurodesis is not a contraindication to transplantation, it can result in increased perioperative bleeding.[citation needed]\nChyle does not generally cause pleural inflammation or fibrosis. Small stable chylous effusions rarely require intervention once the LAM diagnosis is made. Shortness of breath may mandate possibly repeated drainage. Sirolimus is effective for chylous effusions and most experts believe it should be used as the first line of therapy.[65] Imaging the source of the leak with heavy T2-weighted MRI or contrast lymphangiography is an advised for refractory effusions.[117] Some leaks are amenable to embolization through catheters threaded from groin lymph nodes into the thoracic duct. Thoracic duct ligation can be considered, but since thoracic effusions sometimes originate from ascites that are siphoned into the chest by the bellows action of the thorax, it is important to rule out an abdominal source before considering this option. Pleural symphysis may be required to prevent nutritional and lymphocyte deficiencies that can result from repeated taps or persistent drainage. Chemical pleurodesis is generally an effective therapy for chylothorax, as is mechanical abrasion and talc poudrage.[118]\nRenal angiomyolipomas (AMLs) may require embolization or cauterization for control of bleeding, a complication that is thought to be more common when tumor diameter exceeds 4 cm.[119] The extent of aneurysmal change may determine bleeding risk. Serial abdominal imaging should be performed to assess AML size at 6- to 12-month intervals, at least until trends in growth are clear. Nephron sparing partial resections may be considered for very large tumors.[120] Nephrectomy is sometimes required for tumors with intravascular extension or other reasons, but is rarely the approach of choice for AMLs that can be managed by less invasive means. Everolimus is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for AML treatment.[121]\nLymphangioleiomyomatoses are fluid-filled hypodense structures present in the retroperitoneal regions of the abdomen and pelvis in about 30% of LAM patients. They generally do not require intervention. Biopsy or resection can lead to prolonged leakage. mTOR inhibitors are effective at shrinking the size of lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and can lead to total resolution.\nSirolimus is an mTOR inhibitor that stabilizes lung function and improves some measures of life in LAM patients.[35] It is approved by the FDA for use in LAM, based on the results of the Multicenter International LAM Efficacy and Safety of Sirolimus (MILES) Trial. MILES data supports the use of sirolimus in patients who have abnormal lung function (i.e. FEV1<70% predicted). Whether the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks for asymptomatic LAM patients with normal lung function is not clear, but some physicians consider treatment for declining patients who are approaching the abnormal range for FEV1. Sirolimus also appears to be effective for the treatment chylous effusions and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. The benefits of sirolimus only persist while treatment continues. The safety of long term therapy has not been studied.[citation needed]\nPotential side effects from mTOR inhibitors include swelling in the ankles, acne, oral ulcers, dyspepsia, diarrhea, elevation of cholesterol and triglycerides, hypertension and headache. Sirolimus pneumonitis and latent malignancy are more serious concerns, but occur infrequently. Sirolimus inhibits wound healing. It is important to stop therapy with the drug for 1–2 weeks before and after elective procedures that require optimal wound healing. Precautions must be taken to avoid prolonged sun exposure due to increased skin cancer risk.[citation needed]\nTreatment with another mTOR inhibitor, everolimus, was reported in a small, open-label trial to be associated with improvement in FEV1 and six-minute walking distance.[122] Serum levels of VEGF-D and collagen IV were reduced by treatment. Adverse events were generally consistent with those known to be associated with mTOR inhibitors, although some were serious and included peripheral edema, pneumonia, cardiac failure and Pneumocystis jirovecii infection. Escalating doses of everolimus were used, up to 10 mg per day; higher than what is typically used clinically for LAM.\nSerum VEGF-D concentration is useful, predictive and prognostic biomarker.[71] Higher baseline VEGF-D levels predicts more rapid disease progression and a more robust treatment response.\nHormonal approaches to treatment have never been tested in proper trials. In the absence of proven benefit, therapy with progesterone, GnRH agonists (e.g., leuprorelin, goserelin) and tamoxifen are not routinely recommended. Doxycycline had no effect on the rate of lung function decline in a double blind trial.[123]\nSirolimus is often effective as first-line management for chylothorax.[65] If chylous leakage or accumulations persist despite treatment, imaging with heavy T2 weighted MRI, MRI lymphangiography or thoracic duct lymphangiography can be considered. Pleural fusion procedures can be considered in refractory cases.[citation needed]\nEstrogen-containing medications can exacerbate LAM[124] and are contraindicated. Agents that antagonize the effects of estrogen have not been proven to be effective for treatment, but no proper trials have been done. A trial of bronchodilators should be considered in LAM patients, because up to 17–25% have bronchodilator-responsive airflow obstruction.[5][10] Oxygen should be administered to maintain oxyhemoglobin saturations of greater than 90% with rest, exercise and sleep. Bone densitometry should be considered in all patients who are immobilized and/or on antiestrogen therapies, and appropriate therapy instituted for osteoporotic patients. Proper attention should be paid to cardiovascular health following natural or induced menopause. Immunizations for pneumococcus and influenza should be kept up to date. Pulmonary rehabilitation seems to be particularly rewarding in young, motivated patients with obstructive lung disease, but studies to assess this intervention's effect on exercise tolerance, conditioning and quality of life have not been done.[citation needed]",
    "Prognosis": "Survival estimates vary, dependent on mode of presentation or ascertainment, and have generally trended upward, probably due to earlier recognition through more widespread use of CT scanning. In a recent population-based cohort survey, median survival was found to be 29 years.[125] Data from earlier, large case series indicated that 38% to 78% of patients were alive at 8.5 years from the time of disease onset.[3][4][6][126]\nPatients typically develop progressive airflow obstruction. In a cohort of patients in the United Kingdom, 10 years after symptom onset, 55% of 77 patients were breathless walking on flat ground and 10% were housebound.[127] The average annual rate of decline in FEV1 and DLCO in 275 patients studied in a single pulmonary function laboratory at the NHLBI was 75 ± 9 mL, and 0.69 ± 0.07 mL/min/mm Hg, respectively.[128] In other series from Europe, the rate of decline in FEV1 was considerably higher, estimated at approximately 100 to 120 mL/yr.[6][129][130] In the MILES trial, patients in the placebo group lost 134 cc/yr.[35] There was some evidence in these studies that rate of decline in lung function correlates with initial DLCO, with menopausal status and high baseline VEGF-D.\nEstimates of median survival vary from 10 to 30 years, depending on whether hospital-based or population-based cohorts are studied.[98][125][131]",
    "Epidemiology": "LAM is almost completely restricted to women.[132][133] While lung cysts consistent with LAM are reported in some men with tuberous sclerosis, very few of these men develop symptoms. The prevalence of LAM is estimated using data from registries and patient groups and is between 3.4 and 7.8/million women. The number of new cases each year is between 0.23 and 0.31/million women/year in the US, UK and Switzerland. The variation between countries and between adjacent states in the US, suggest that a significant number of women with LAM remain either undiagnosed or their symptoms are attributed to other diseases.[134] Adult women with tuberous sclerosis are more likely to develop LAM than women without tuberous sclerosis. Cohorts of patients with tuberous sclerosis have been screened for LAM using CT scanning. In a retrospective study of adults with tuberous sclerosis, CT demonstrated lung cysts in 42% of 95 women and 13% of 91 men. In general, lung cysts were larger and more numerous in women than in men.[135] In a further retrospective study of women with TSC who underwent CT scanning to detect LAM, 25% of those in their 20s had lung cysts whereas 80% of women in their 40s were affected, suggesting that the development of LAM is age dependent at least in tuberous sclerosis-related LAM.[79] Although the prevalence of tuberous sclerosis at 1 in 6,000 births is much greater than that of LAM, most pulmonary clinics see more cases of sporadic than tuberous sclerosis–LAM: probably due to a combination of low levels of screening for LAM in tuberous sclerosis and in many, the absence of symptoms.[citation needed]\nFemale sex and tuberous sclerosis are the only known risk factors. Although use of supplemental estrogen is not associated with development of LAM,[136] one study suggested that use of estrogen-containing contraceptive pills was associated with earlier onset.[137]\nIt occurs in more than 30% of women with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC-LAM), a heritable syndrome that is associated with seizures, cognitive impairment and benign tumors in multiple tissues.[9][138][139][79] Most LAM patients who present for medical evaluation have the sporadic form of the disease (S-LAM), however, which is not associated with other manifestations of tuberous sclerosis complex.\nMild cystic changes consistent with LAM have been described in 10–15% of men with TSC,[140][135] but symptomatic LAM in males is rare.[132][133] Sporadic LAM occurs exclusively in women, with one published exception to date.[133] Both TSC-LAM and S-LAM are associated with mutations in tuberous sclerosis genes.[21]",
    "Society and culture": "The LAM Foundation was founded in 1995 as a grassroots organization to provide patient advocacy and research funding.[146] Today, the LAM Foundation provides support and education for women with LAM and their families, engages doctors and scientists to continue to learn more about the disease, and raises funds for the continued study of LAM. It seeks safe and effective treatments, and ultimately a cure, for lymphangioleiomyomatosis. It is headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio."

    "Disease": "Lymphangiomatosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Lymphangiomatosis is a multi-system disorder. Symptoms depend on the organ system involved and, to varying degrees, the extent of the disease. Early in the course of the disease patients are usually asymptomatic, but over time the abnormally proliferating lymphatic channels that constitute lymphangiomatosis are capable of massive expansion and infiltration into surrounding tissues, bone, and organs.[2] Because of its slow course and often vague symptoms, the condition is frequently under-recognized or misdiagnosed.[8]\nEarly signs of disease in the chest include wheezing, cough, and feeling short of breath, which is often misdiagnosed as asthma.[2] The pain that accompanies bone involvement may be attributed to \"growing pains\" in younger children. With bone involvement the first indication for disease may be a pathological fracture. Symptoms may not raise concern, or even be noted, until the disease process has advanced to a point where it causes restrictive compression of vital structures. Further, the occurrence of chylous effusions seems to be unrelated to the pathologic \"burden\" of the disease, the extent of involvement in any particular tissue or organ, or the age of the patient.[9] This offers one explanation as to why, unfortunately, the appearance of chylous effusions in the chest or abdomen may be the first evidence of the disease.[citation needed]\nFollowing are some of the commonly reported symptoms of lymphangiomatosis, divided into the regions/systems in which the disease occurs:\nSymptoms that arise from disease of the cardiothoracic region include a chronic cough, wheezing, dyspnea (shortness of breath)—especially serious when occurring at rest or when lying down—fever, chest pain, rapid heartbeat, dizziness, anxiety, and coughing up blood or chyle.[2] As the deranged lymphatic vessels invade the organs and tissues in the chest they put stress on the heart and lungs, interfering with their ability to function normally. Additionally, these lymphatic vessels may leak, allowing fluid to accumulate in the chest, which puts further pressure on the vital organs, thus increasing their inability to function properly.[2] Accumulations of fluid and chyle are named based on their contents and location: pulmonary edema (the presence of fluid and/or chyle in the lung), pleural effusions (fluid in the lung lining), pericardial effusions (fluid in the heart sack), chylothorax (chyle in the pleural cavity); and chylopericardium (chyle in the heart sack).[citation needed]\nLymphangiomatosis has been reported in every region of the abdomen, though the most reported sites involve the intestines and peritoneum; spleen, kidneys, and liver. Often there are no symptoms until late in the progression of the disease. When they do occur, symptoms include abdominal pain and/or distension; nausea, vomiting, diarrhea; decreased appetite and malnourishment. When the disease affects the kidneys the symptoms include flank pain, abdominal distension, blood in the urine, and, possibly, elevated blood pressure, which may result in it being confused with other cystic renal disease.[10] When lymphangiomatosis occurs in the liver and/or spleen it may be confused with polycystic liver disease.[11] Symptoms may include abdominal fullness and distension; anemia, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), fluid accumulation in the abdomen(ascites), decreased appetite, weight loss, fatigue; late findings include liver failure.[2][11][12]\nSymptoms of lymphangiomatosis in the skeletal system are the same as those of Gorham’s disease. Frequently asymptomatic, skeletal lymphangiomatosis may be discovered incidentally or when a pathological fracture occurs. Patients may experience pain of varying severity in areas around the affected bone. When the disease occurs in the bones of the spine, neurological symptoms such as numbness and tingling may occur due to spinal nerve compression.[13] Progression of disease in the spine may lead to paralysis. Lymphangiomatosis in conjunction with Chiari I malformation also has been reported.[14]",
    "Causes": "The cause of lymphangiomatosis is not yet known. As stated earlier, it is generally considered to be the result of congenital errors of lymphatic development occurring prior to the 20th week of gestation.[2]  However, the root causes of these conditions remains unknown and further research is necessary.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "Because it is rare and has a wide spectrum of clinical, histological, and imaging features, diagnosing lymphangiomatosis can be challenging.[15] Plain x-rays reveal the presence of lytic lesions in bones, pathological fractures, interstitial infiltrates in the lungs, and chylous effusions that may be present even when there are no outward symptoms.[2][5][7]\nThe most common locations of lymphangiomatosis are the lungs and bones and one important diagnostic clue is the coexistence of lytic bone lesions and chylous effusion.[2] An isolated presentation usually carries a better prognosis than does multi-organ involvement; the combination of pleural and peritoneal involvement with chylous effusions and lytic bone lesions carries the least favorable prognosis.[16]\nWhen lung involvement is suspected, high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans may reveal a diffuse liquid-like infiltration in the mediastinal and hilar soft tissue, resulting from diffuse proliferation of lymphatic channels and accumulation of lymphatic fluid; diffuse peribronchovascular and interlobular septal thickening; ground-glass opacities; and pleural effusion.[2][17] Pulmonary function testing reveals either restrictive pattern or a mixed obstructive/restrictive pattern.[2][4]  While x-rays, HRCT scan, MRI, ultrasound, lymphangiography, bone scan, and bronchoscopy all can have a role in identifying lymphangiomatosis, biopsy remains the definitive diagnostic tool.[2][5][7][17][18][19]\nMicroscopic examination of biopsy specimens reveals an increase in both the size and number of thin walled lymphatic channels along with lymphatic spaces that are interconnecting and dilated, lined by a single attenuated layer of endothelial cells involving the dermis, subcutis, and possibly underlying fascia and skeletal muscle.[3] Additionally, Tazelaar, et al., described a pattern of histological features of lung specimens from nine patients in whom no extrathoracic lesions were identified, which they termed \"diffuse pulmonary lymphangiomatosis\" (DPL).[4]\nRecognition of the disease requires a high index of suspicion and an extensive workup. Because of its serious morbidity, lymphangiomatosis must always be considered in the differential diagnosis of lytic bone lesions accompanied by chylous effusions, in cases of primary chylopericardium, and as part of the differential diagnosis in pediatric patients presenting with signs of interstitial lung disease.[2][18][20][21]",
    "Treatment": "There is no standard approach to the treatment of lymphangiomatosis and treatment often is aimed at reducing symptoms.[2][17] Surgical intervention may be indicated when complications arise and a number of reports of response to surgical interventions, medications, and dietary approaches can be found in the medical literature.[2][16][17]\nUnfortunately, there is no standardized treatment for lymphangiomatosis and no cure.\nTreatment modalities that have been reported in the medical literature, by system, include:\nThoracocentesis, pericardiocentesis, pleurodesis, ligation of thoracic duct, pleuroperitoneal shunt, radiation therapy, pleurectomy, pericardial window, pericardiectomy, thalidomide, interferon alpha 2b, Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN), medium chain triglyceride (MCT) and high protein diet, chemotherapy, sclerotherapy, transplant;[citation needed]\ninterferon alpha 2b, sclerotherapy, resection, percutaneous drainage,  Denver shunt, Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN), medium chain triglyceride (MCT) and high protein diet, transplant, splenectomy;[citation needed]\nInterferon alpha 2b, bisphosphonates (i.e. pamidronate), surgical resection, radiation therapy, sclerotherapy, percutaneous bone cement, bone grafts, prosthesis, surgical stabilization.[citation needed]",
    "Epidemiology": "Lymphangiomatosis can occur at any age, but the incidence is highest in children and teenagers. Signs and symptoms are typically present before the age of 20 and the condition is often under-recognized in adults.[2]\nIt affects males and females of all races and exhibits no inheritance pattern. The medical literature contains case reports from every continent. Because it is so rare, and commonly misdiagnosed, it is not known exactly how many people are affected by this disease.[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "Lysinuric protein intolerance",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Infants with LPI are usually symptom-free when breastfed because of the low protein concentration in human milk, but develop vomiting and diarrhea after weaning. The patients show failure to thrive, poor appetite, growth retardation, enlarged liver and spleen, prominent osteoporosis and osteopenia,[4] delayed bone age and spontaneous protein aversion. Forced feeding of protein may lead to convulsions and coma. Mental development is normal if prolonged episode of hyperammonemia can be avoided. Some patients develop severe pulmonary and kidney complications. High levels of plasma glutamine and glycine are observed.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is based on the biochemical findings (increased concentrations of lysine, arginine and ornithine in urine and low concentrations of these amino acids in plasma, elevation of urinary orotic acid excretion after protein-rich meals, and inappropriately high concentrations of serum ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes) and the screening of known mutations of the causative gene from a DNA sample.[8]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment of LPI consists of protein-restricted diet and supplementation with oral  citrulline.[9] Citrulline is a neutral amino acid that improves the function of the urea cycle and allows sufficient protein intake without hyperammonemia.[10]",
    "Prognosis": "Under proper dietary control and supplementation, the majority of the LPI patients are able to have a nearly normal life. However, severe complications including pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and chronic kidney disease may develop even with proper treatment.[11]Fertility appears to be normal in women, but mothers with LPI have an increased risk for complications during pregnancy and delivery.[12]"

    "Disease": "Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Infants may present with feeding difficulties, with frequent vomiting, diarrhea, swelling of the abdomen, and failure to gain weight or sometimes weight loss.[2]\nAs the disease progresses in infants, increasing fat accumulation in the liver leads to other complications, including yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), and a persistent low-grade fever. An ultrasound examination shows an accumulation of chalky material (calcification) in the adrenal gland in about half of infants with LAL-D.[2][4] Complications of LAL-D progress over time, eventually leading to life-threatening problems, such as extremely low levels of circulating red blood cells (severe anemia), liver dysfunction or failure, and physical wasting (cachexia).[2]\nOlder children or adults generally present with a wide range of signs and symptoms that overlap with other disorders.[5] They may have diarrhoea, stomach pain, vomiting, or poor growth, a sign of malabsorption. They may have signs of bile-duct problems, like itchiness, jaundice, pale stool, or dark urine. Their feces may be excessively greasy. They often have an enlarged liver, liver disease, and may have yellowish deposits of fat underneath the skin, usually around their eyelids.[2][5] The disease is often undiagnosed in adults.[6] The person may have a history of premature cardiac disease or premature stroke.[2]",
    "Causes": "Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency is a genetic disease that is autosomal recessive. It is an inborn error of metabolism that causes a lysosomal storage disease.[2] The condition is caused by a mutation of the LIPA gene, which encodes the lysosomal lipase protein (also called lysosomal acid lipase or LAL), that results in a loss of the protein's normal function.[3] When LAL functions normally, it breaks down cholesteryl esters and triglycerides in low-density lipoprotein particles into free cholesterol and free fatty acids that the body can reuse; when LAL does not function, cholesteryl esters and triglycerides build up in the liver, spleen, and other organs.[2][5] The accumulation of fat in the walls of the gut and other organs in leads to serious digestive problems, including malabsorption, a condition in which the gut fails to absorb nutrients and calories from food, persistent and often forceful vomiting, frequent diarrhea, foul-smelling and fatty stools (steatorrhea), and failure to grow.[2]\nLysosomal acid lipase deficiencies occur when a person has defects (mutations) in both copies of the LIPA gene. Each parent of a person with LAL-D carries one copy of the defective LIPA gene. With every pregnancy, parents with a son or daughter affected by LAL deficiency have a one in four (25%) chance of having another affected child. A person born with defects in both LIPA genes is not able to produce adequate amounts of the LAL enzyme.[5]",
    "Diagnosis": "Blood tests may show anaemia with lipid profiles that are generally similar to people with more common familial hypercholesterolemia, including elevated total cholesterol, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and elevated serum transaminases.[2]\nLiver biopsy findings generally show a bright yellow-orange color, enlarged, lipid-laden hepatocytes and Kupffer cells, microvesicular and macrovesicular steatosis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis.[2] The only definitive tests are genetic, which may be conducted in any number of ways.[5]",
    "Treatment": "LAL deficiency can be treated with sebelipase alfa, a recombinant form of LAL that was approved in 2015 in the US and EU.[7][8] The disease of LAL affects < 0.2 in 10,000 people in the EU.[8] According to an estimate by a Barclays analyst, the drug will be priced at about US$375,000 per year.[8]\nIt is administered once a week via intravenous infusion in people with rapidly progressing disease in the first six months of life. In people with less aggressive disease, it is given every other week.[9]\nBefore the drug was approved, treatment of infants was mainly focused on reducing specific complications and was provided in specialized centers. Specific interventions for infants included changing from breast milk or normal bottle formula to a specialized low-fat formula, intravenous feeding, antibiotics for infections, and steroid replacement therapy because of concerns about adrenal function.[2]\nStatins were used in people with LAL-D before the approval of sebelipase alfa; they helped control cholesterol, but did not appear to slow liver damage; liver transplantation was necessary for most patients.[2]",
    "Prognosis": "Infants with LAL deficiencies typically show signs of disease in the first weeks of life, and if untreated, die within 6–12 months due to multiple organ failure.[2] Older children or adults with LAL-D may remain undiagnosed or be misdiagnosed until they die early from a heart attack or stroke or die suddenly of liver failure.[2] The first enzyme-replacement therapy was approved in 2015. In those clinical trials, nine infants were followed for one year; six of them lived beyond one year.[9] Older children and adults were followed for 36 weeks.[9]",
    "Epidemiology": "Depending on ethnicity and geography, prevalence has been estimated to be between one in 40,000 and one in 300,000; based on these estimates, the disease may be underdiagnosed. Jewish infants of Iraqi or Iranian origin appear to be most at risk based on a study of a community in Los Angeles in which a prevalence of one in 4200 was found.[2][5]"

    "Disease": "Machado%E2%80%93Joseph disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Symptoms of MJD are memory deficits,[4] spasticity, difficulty with speech and swallowing, weakness in arms and legs, clumsiness, frequent urination and involuntary eye movements.  Symptoms can begin in early adolescence and they get worse over time. Eventually, MJD leads to paralysis; however, intellectual functions usually remain the same.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "MJD can be diagnosed by recognizing the symptoms of the disease and by taking a family history.  Physicians ask patients questions about the kind of symptoms relatives with the disease had, the progression and harshness of symptoms, and the ages of onset in family members.[citation needed]\nPresymptomatic diagnosis of MJD can be made with a genetic test.[17] The direct detection of the genetic mutation responsible for MJD has been available since 1995.[18] Genetic testing looks at the number of CAG repeats within the coding region of the MJD/ATXN3 gene on chromosome 14. The test will show positive for MJD if this region contains 61–87 repeats, as opposed to the 12–44 repeats found in healthy individuals. A limitation to this test is that if the number of CAG repeats in an individual being tested falls between the healthy and pathogenic ranges (45–60 repeats), then the test cannot predict whether an individual will have MJD symptoms.[17]\nThere are five sub-types of MJD [1] that are characterized by the age of onset and range of symptoms.\nThe sub-types illustrate a wide variety of symptoms that patients can experience.[1] However, assigning individuals to a specific sub-type of the disease is of limited clinical significance.[1]",
    "Treatment": "There is no cure for Machado-Joseph Disease.  However, treatments are available for some symptoms.[1][3]  For example, spasticity can be reduced with antispasmodic drugs, such as baclofen.  The Parkinsonian symptoms can be treated with levodopa therapy. Prism glasses can reduce diplopic symptoms.[3] Physiotherapy/Physical Therapy and/or occupational therapy can help patients by prescribing mobility aids to increase the patients' independence, providing gait training, and prescribing exercises to maintain the mobility of various joints and general health to decrease the likelihood of falls or injuries as a result of falls. Walkers and wheelchairs can greatly help the patient with everyday tasks. Some patients will experience difficulties with speech and swallowing, therefore a Speech-Language Pathologist can assist the patients to improve their communicating abilities and their issues with swallowing.[3]\nSome experimental treatments using trehalose have been suggested. In 2021, the FDA accepted an Investigational New Drug (IND) application and granted fast track status for an injectable form of trehalose (SLS-005) as a potential treatment for spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3).[19][20]",
    "Prognosis": "Patients with severe forms of MJD have a life expectancy of approximately 35 years. Those with mild forms have a normal life expectancy. The cause of death of those who die early is often aspiration pneumonia.[21]\nUnlike many other medical conditions, Machado–Joseph disease is not named after researchers. It is named after two men (\"William Machado\" and \"Antone Joseph\") who were the patriarchs of the families in which the condition was initially described.[22] The highest prevalence of the condition is on Australia's Groote Eylandt where 5% of the population are currently symptomatic or at risk,[23] followed by the Azorean island of Flores where around 1 in 140 individuals in the population are diagnosed with MJD.[24]",
    "Society and culture": "Brazilian comedian, actor and TV personality Guilherme Karam was diagnosed with Machado–Joseph disease, having inherited it from his mother, like his brother and sister.[25] He died on 7 July 2016.[26]\nIn a video on Facebook just days after Karam's death, Brazilian  personality,  journalist and television presenter, Arnaldo Duran publicly acknowledged his condition with Machado-Joseph. Brazilian press gave huge attention to both cases.[27]"

    "Disease": "Malignant hyperthermia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The typical signs of malignant hyperthermia are due to a hypercatabolic state, which presents as a very high temperature, an increased heart rate and abnormally rapid breathing, increased carbon dioxide production, increased oxygen consumption, mixed acidosis, rigid muscles, and rhabdomyolysis.[5] These signs can develop any time during the administration of the anesthetic triggering agents. Rarely, signs may develop up to 40 minutes after the end of anaesthesia.[6]",
    "Causes": "Malignant hyperthermia is a disorder that can be considered a gene–environment interaction. In most people with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility, they have few or no symptoms unless they are exposed to a triggering agent. The most common triggering agents are volatile anesthetic gases, such as halothane, sevoflurane, desflurane, isoflurane, enflurane or the depolarizing muscle relaxants suxamethonium and decamethonium used primarily in general anesthesia.[5] In rare cases, the biological stresses of physical exercise or heat may be the trigger.[5][7] In fact, malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS), predisposed by mutations in the skeletal muscle calcium release channel (RYR1), is one of the most severe heat-related illnesses. The MHS-associated heat susceptibilities predominantly affect children and metabolically active young adults, often leading to life- threatening hypermetabolic responses to heat.[8]\nOther anesthetic drugs do not trigger malignant hyperthermia. Some examples of drugs that don't cause MH include local anesthetics (lidocaine, bupivacaine, mepivacaine), opiates (morphine, fentanyl), ketamine, barbiturates, nitrous oxide, propofol, etomidate, and benzodiazepines. The nondepolarizing muscle relaxants pancuronium, cisatracurium, atracurium, mivacurium, vecuronium and rocuronium also are generally thought to be safe for patients MH.[9]\nThere is mounting evidence that some individuals with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility may develop MH with exercise and/or on exposure to hot environments.[10]\nMalignant hyperthermia's inheritance is autosomal dominant with variable penetrance.[5] The defect is typically located on the long arm of chromosome 19 (19q13.2[11]) involving the ryanodine receptor.[5] More than 25 different mutations in this gene are linked with malignant hyperthermia.[5] These mutations tend to cluster in one of three domains within the protein, designated MH1-3. MH1 and MH2 are located in the N-terminus of the protein, which interacts with L-type calcium channels and Ca2+. MH3 is located in the transmembrane forming C-terminus. This region is important for allowing Ca2+ passage through the protein following opening.[citation needed]\nChromosome 7q and chromosome 17 have also been implicated.  It has also been postulated that MH and central core disease may be allelic and thus can be co-inherited.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "The earliest signs may include: masseter muscle contracture following administration of succinylcholine, a rise in end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration (despite increased minute ventilation), unexplained tachycardia, and muscle rigidity.[5]  Despite the name, elevation of body temperature is often a late sign, but may appear early in severe cases. Respiratory acidosis is universally present and many patients have developed metabolic acidosis at the time of diagnosis. A fast rate of breathing (in a spontaneously breathing patient), cyanosis, hypertension, abnormal heart rhythms, and high blood potassium may also be seen. Core body temperatures should be measured in any patient undergoing general anesthesia longer than 30 minutes.[citation needed]\nMalignant hyperthermia is diagnosed on clinical grounds, but various laboratory investigations may prove confirmatory. These include a raised creatine kinase level, elevated potassium, increased phosphate (leading to decreased calcium) and—if determined—raised myoglobin; this is the result of damage to muscle cells. Severe rhabdomyolysis may lead to acute kidney failure, so kidney function is generally measured on a frequent basis.  Patients may also experience premature ventricular contractions due to the increased levels of potassium released from the muscles during episodes.[citation needed]\nThe main candidates for testing are those with a close relative who has had an episode of MH or have been shown to be susceptible. The standard procedure is the \"caffeine-halothane contracture test\", CHCT. A muscle biopsy is carried out at an approved research center, under local anesthesia. The fresh biopsy is bathed in solutions containing caffeine or halothane and observed for contraction; under good conditions, the sensitivity is 97% and the specificity 78%.[26] Negative biopsies are not definitive, so any patient who is suspected of MH by their medical history or that of blood relatives is generally treated with non-triggering anesthetics, even if the biopsy was negative. Some researchers advocate the use of the \"calcium-induced calcium release\" test in addition to the CHCT to make the test more specific.[citation needed]\nLess invasive diagnostic techniques have been proposed. Intramuscular injection of halothane 6 vol% has been shown to result in higher than normal increases in local pCO2 among patients with known malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. The sensitivity was 100% and specificity was 75%. For patients at similar risk to those in this study, this leads to a positive predictive value of 80% and negative predictive value of 100%. This method may provide a suitable alternative to more invasive techniques.[27]\nA 2002 study examined another possible metabolic test. In this test, intramuscular injection of caffeine was followed by local measurement of the pCO2; those with known MH susceptibility had a significantly higher pCO2 (63 versus 44 mmHg). The authors propose larger studies to assess the test's suitability for determining MH risk.[28]\nGenetic testing is being performed in a limited fashion to determine susceptibility to MH.[5] In people with a family history of MH, analysis for RYR1 mutations may be useful.[19]\nA 1994 consensus conference led to the formulation of a set of diagnostic criteria. The higher the score (above 6), the more likely a reaction constituted MH:[29]",
    "Treatment": "The current treatment of choice is the intravenous administration of dantrolene, the only known antidote, discontinuation of triggering agents, and supportive therapy directed at correcting hyperthermia, acidosis, and organ dysfunction. Treatment must be instituted rapidly on clinical suspicion of the onset of malignant hyperthermia.[32]\nDantrolene is a muscle relaxant that appears to work directly on the ryanodine receptor to prevent the release of calcium. After the widespread introduction of treatment with dantrolene, the mortality of malignant hyperthermia fell from 80% in the 1960s to less than 5%.[5] Dantrolene remains the only drug known to be effective in the treatment of MH.[30] The recommended dose of dantrolene is 2.5 mg/kg, repeated as necessary.[5] It is recommended that each hospital keeps a minimum stock of 36 dantrolene vials (720 mg), sufficient for four doses in a 70-kg person.[36]\nFast recognition and treatment of MH utilizes skills and procedures that are utilized with a low-frequency and high-risk.[37] Conducting MH crisis training for perioperative teams can identify system failures as well as improve response to these events.[38] Simulation techniques to include the use of cognitive aids have also been shown to improve communication in clinical treatment of MH.[39][40]",
    "Prognosis": "Prognosis is poor if this condition is not aggressively treated.[5] In the 1970s, mortality was greater than 80%; however,  with the current management mortality is now less than 5%.[5]",
    "Epidemiology": "It occurs in between 1:5,000 and 1:100,000 in procedures involving general anaesthesia.[5] This disorder occurs worldwide and affects all racial groups.\nIn the Manawatū region of New Zealand, up to 1 in 200 people are at high risk of the condition.[41]"

    "Disease": "Malonic aciduria",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The signs and symptoms of this disorder typically appear in early childhood. Almost all affected children have delayed development. Additional signs and symptoms can include weak muscle tone (hypotonia), seizures, diarrhea, vomiting, and low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). A heart condition called cardiomyopathy, which weakens and enlarges the heart muscle, is another common feature of malonic aciduria.",
    "Diagnosis": "Screening for elevated organic acids, especially malonic acid and methylmalonic acid and for high malonylcarnitine.[6] The diagnosis can then be confirmed by determining the enzyme activity of malonyl-coA decarboxylase in cultured skin fibroblasts.[6] Molecular genetic testing of the MLYCD gene may also be useful.[6]\nBy calculating the malonic acid to methylmalonic acid ratio in blood plasma, malonic aciduria can be clearly distinguished from combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA) and classic methylmalonic acidemia.[14] The latter applies for both, vitamin B12 responders and non-responders in methylmalonic acidemia.[14] In malonic aciduria, the results of the ratio are greater than 1, as the malonic acid value is higher than the methylmalonic acid value.[3] In CMAMMA, on the other hand, the result is less than 1 because the methylmalonic acid is higher than the malonic acid.[11]",
    "Treatment": "A research conducted in Netherlands has suggested that carnitine supplements and a low fat diet may help to reduce the level of malonic acid in our body.[5]",
    "Epidemiology": "According to Orphanet (2006), the prevalence is less than 1 in 1,000,000.[6]\nIn 1984, malonic aciduria was described for the first time in a scientific study.[7]\nBy 1999, only seven cases of malonic aciduria had been reported in human in Australia; however, this deficiency predominately occurs during childhood. Patients from the seven reported cases of malonic aciduria have an age range between 4 days to 13 years, and they all have the common symptom of delayed neurological development.[4]\nBy 2006, 17 cases of malonic aciduria had been published in the literature worldwide, ranging in age from 8 days to 12 years.[3]\nBy 2017, less than 30 cases were known in the literature.[8]"

Patients (especially the ones with the difference that was mentioned beforehand) have a higher risk of having anomalies in the ear canal, the auditory ossicles, or semicircular canals. These abnormalities (with the exception of the preauricular tags) end up in hearing loss in some to most cases.[4]\nThere are also oral and respiratory anomalies present within the condition, cleft palates and choanal atresia aren't uncommon findings. Choanal atresia in particular can end up causing breathing difficulties to the patient.[4]\nOccasional findings include short stature, heart and thumb defects, esophageal atresia, and tracheoesophageal fistula. These last two symptoms are highly fatal, and may end up in premature death if left untreated.[4]\nUnilateral choanal atresia can cause neo-natal breathing difficulties and posteriorly mouth breathing, which, although not especially life-threatening, can be deprimental and cause symptoms such as narrow face, tired eyes, etc.[5]\nBilateral choanal atresia can cause respiratory distress and, in most cases, arrest.[5]\nEsophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula can be deadly if they are left untreated. The latter causes an abnormal connection between the esophagus and the trachea, which causes esophageal fluids to enter the airways and cause respiratory problems. The combination of both esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula is especially life-threatening due to feeding difficulties and recurrent esophageal fluid exposure-associated lung damage.[4]",
    "Causes": "This condition is caused by inherited autosomal recessive mutations in the EFTUD2 gene. These mutations can either be missense, splice-site, or the result of a microdeletion.[6] This gene is essential for the formation of spliceosomes, which helps in producing and maturing messenger RNA. The mutations involved in MFDM cause EFTUD2 enzymes with little to no function, which likely impairs the process of maturing mRNA.[7]",

    "Disease": "Maple syrup urine disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of MSUD vary between patients and are greatly related to the amount of residual enzyme activity.[11] Some characteristics of MSUD include maple syrup odor to the urine or earwax, neurological disorders, psychological disorders, feeding problems, and metabolic acidosis.[12] If left untreated, it may lead to metabolic crisis. Metabolic crises can be life-threatening and should be treated immediately.[4]",
    "Causes": "Mutations in the following genes cause maple syrup urine disease:\nThese four genes produce proteins that work together as the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex. The complex is essential for breaking down the amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine. These are present in some quantity in almost all kinds of food, but in particular, protein-rich foods such as dairy products, meat, fish, soy, gluten, eggs, nuts, whole grains, seeds, avocados, algae, edible seaweed, beans, and pulses. Mutation in any of these genes reduces or eliminates the function of the enzyme complex, preventing the normal breakdown of isoleucine, leucine, and valine. As a result, these amino acids and their by-products build up in the body. Because high levels of these substances are toxic to the brain and other organs, this accumulation leads to the serious medical problems associated with maple syrup urine disease.[citation needed]\nThis condition has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, which means the defective gene is located on an autosome, and two copies of the gene – one from each parent – must be inherited to be affected by the disorder. The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are carriers of one copy of the defective gene, but are usually unaffected by the disorder.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "Initially, the diagnosis was commonly made based on suggestive symptoms and odor, the odor coming from the compound sotolon (sometimes spelled sotolone).[3] These days, affected individuals are now often identified by characteristic elevations on plasma amino acid which do not have the characteristic odor.[10]\nThe preferred prenatal diagnostic method is molecular analysis which requires a mutational analysis to measure BCKAD (branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase) enzyme activity in chorion villus cells or amniocytes. Another measurement method is BCAA (branched-chain amino acid) concentration in amniotic fluids.[19]\nOn May 9, 2014, the UK National Screening Committee (UK NSC) announced its recommendation to screen every newborn baby in the UK for four further genetic disorders as part of its NHS Newborn Blood Spot Screening programme, including maple syrup urine disease.[20] The disease is estimated to affect 1 out of 185,000 infants worldwide and its frequency increases with certain heritages.[5]\nNewborn screening for maple syrup urine disease involves analyzing the blood of 1–2 day-old newborns through tandem mass spectrometry. The blood concentration of leucine and isoleucine is measured relative to other amino acids to determine if the newborn has a high level of branched-chain amino acids. Once the newborn is 2–3 days old the blood concentration of branched-chain amino acids like leucine is greater than 1000 μmol/L and alternative screening methods are used. Instead, the newborn's urine is analyzed for levels of branched-chain alpha-hydroxyacids and alpha-ketoacids.[3]\nOther diagnostic methods include additional laboratory studies which include gas and liquid chromatography, BCKAD (branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase) enzyme activity, dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) test, and molecular testing. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, urine test strips and the DNPH test can detect urinary organic acid that supports the diagnosis of MSUD.[8]\nBranched-chain-ketoacids can be detected by the DNPH test, where the DNPH reagent and urine get mixed equally and are observed for ten minutes to see color and precipitation changes. After ten minutes, if a yellow-white precipitate is displayed, it is a positive result. If a clear precipitate is displayed, it is a negative result.[8]\nIf a newborn screening was not performed, the result of the newborn screening is a false negative, or the newborn was not treated after a positive result, the clinical findings can be maple syrup odor twelve hours after birth. Four to five days after birth, other signs can present, such as stereotyped movements like \"fencing\" and \"bicycling\" along with worsening encephalopathy including lethargy, irregular apnea, and opisthotonus. Seven to ten days after birth, respiratory failure and coma can happen.[21]\nMSUD has five clinical phenotypes that are very distinct from one another. The most common and severe is the classical type with low residual activity from 0–2% of normal. Milder types include intermediate and intermittent with higher residual activities from 3–30% of the normal. Most unique is the thiamine-responsive type, where patients respond to high doses of thiamine administered, although this method is controversial. Lastly, the E-3 deficient type is correlated to combined enzyme deficiencies in pyruvate dehydrogenase, BCKD complexes, and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, since E3 is common within mitochondrial alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes.[22]\nNBS (newborn screening) detects most individuals with intermediate MSUD, but those who were not screened as newborns can be later diagnosed with MSUD. In these individuals, plasma BCAA concentrations are similar to those who have classic MSUD. However, they have better Lucine tolerance, and during acute metabolic decompensation episodes, they do not require intensive nutritional support. Severe metabolic intoxication with significant encephalopathy and leucinosis can occur if subjected to serious catabolic stress.[23]",
    "Treatment": "Keeping MSUD under control requires careful monitoring of blood chemistry, both at home and in a hospital setting. DNPH or specialized dipsticks may be used to test the patient's urine for ketones (a sign of metabolic decompensation), when metabolic stress is likely or suspected. Fingerstick tests are performed regularly and sent to a laboratory to determine blood levels of leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Regular metabolic consultations, including blood draws for full nutritional analysis, are recommended; especially during puberty and periods of rapid growth. MSUD management also involves a specially tailored metabolic formula, a modified diet, and lifestyle precautions such as avoiding fatigue and infections, as well as consuming regular, sufficient calories in proportion to physical stress and exertion. Without sufficient calories, catabolism of muscle protein will result in a metabolic crisis. Those with MSUD must be hospitalized for intravenous infusion of sugars and nasogastric drip-feeding of formula, in the event of metabolic decompensation, or lack of appetite, diarrhea or vomiting. Food avoidance, rejection of formula, and picky eating are all common problems with MSUD. Some patients may need to receive all or part of their daily nutrition through a feeding tube.[citation needed]\nAppropriate Branched-Chain Amino Acid (BCAA) blood concentrations:\nLEU plasma concentrations for infants and children 5 years old and younger should be between 75-200 mmol/L. For anyone 5 years or older LEU plasma concentrations should maintain between 75-300 mmol/L to maintain mental status. LEU is key for protein synthesis involved with growth, repair, and health maintenance.[citation needed]\nILE and VAL plasma concentrations should ideally be between 200-400 mmol/L to maintain metabolic balance and avoid BCAA deficits. Isoleucine and Valine help promote anabolism which decreases plasma Leucine concentrations.[25]\nFollowing diagnosis, rapid removal of excess leucine from the body reduces the impact of the disease on development. Some methods of toxin removal include Exchange transfusion, hemodialysis, or hemofiltration.[26] Exchange transfusion is an option to consider because it decreases high BCAA levels without disrupting the plasma repeatedly, however after exchange the BCAA levels will increase with the tissue storage releasing BCAAs. Hemodialysis is a safe and effective way to reduce elevated BCAA levels while correcting electrolyte and acid-base imbalances in an infant. Hemodialysis can be started as soon as a diagnosis is made when it is combined with dietary feeds that maintain recommended calorie and amino acid intake.[27]\nA diet with carefully controlled levels of the amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine must be maintained at all times to reduce toxic metabolites to prevent neurological damage. Since these three amino acids occur in all-natural protein, and most natural foods contain some protein, any food intake must be closely monitored, and day-to-day protein intake calculated on a cumulative basis, to ensure individual tolerance levels are not exceeded at any time. As the MSUD diet is so protein-restricted, and adequate protein is a requirement for all humans, a tailored metabolic formula containing all the other essential amino acids, as well as any vitamins, minerals, omega-3 fatty acids and trace elements (which may be lacking due to the limited range of permissible foods), are an essential aspect of MSUD management. These complement the MSUD patient's natural food intake to meet normal nutritional requirements without causing harm.[28] If adequate calories cannot be obtained from natural food without exceeding protein tolerance, specialized low protein products such as starch-based baking mixtures, imitation rice and pasta may be prescribed, often alongside a protein-free carbohydrate powder added to food and/or drink, and increased at times of metabolic stress. MSUD patients with thiamine-responsive MSUD can have a higher protein intake diet with the administration of high doses of thiamine, a cofactor of the enzyme that causes the condition. The typical dosage amount of thiamine-responsive MSUD depends on the enzyme activity present and can range from 10 mg - 100 mg daily.[citation needed]\nWhen Leucine plasma levels elevate due to not following the strict MSUD diets, infection, or physiological stress this may induce acute metabolic decompensation. Individuals with lower residual BCKAD activity have increased risk. Typically Leucine levels >380 mmol/L will lead to metabolic decompensation. The goal in treating acute decompensation is to stop protein breakdown and increase protein synthesis.[8] When an individual is facing acute metabolic decompensation it is important to remove or correct the stressor that is causing physiologic decompensation. During decompensation, the individual must be still receiving the proper amount of calories, insulin, free amino acids, isoleucine, and valine to help promote protein synthesis.[3]\nUsually, MSUD patients are monitored by a dietitian. Liver transplantation is a treatment option that can completely and permanently normalize metabolic function, enabling discontinuation of nutritional supplements and strict monitoring of biochemistry and caloric intake, relaxation of MSUD-related lifestyle precautions, and an unrestricted diet. Liver transplantation increased the BKD function to increase by 10% which is understood to be enough to prevent buildup of BCAA's that may lead to metabolic consequences.[29] This procedure is most successful when performed at a young age, and weaning from immunosuppressants may even be possible in the long run. However, the surgery is a major undertaking requiring extensive hospitalization and rigorous adherence to a tapering regimen of medications. Following transplant, the risk of periodic rejection will always exist, as will the need for some degree of lifelong monitoring in this respect. Despite normalizing clinical presentation, liver transplantation is not considered a cure for MSUD. The patient will still carry two copies of the mutated BKAD gene in each of their cells, which will consequently still be unable to produce the missing enzyme. They will also still pass one mutated copy of the gene on to each of their biological children. As a major surgery, the transplant procedure itself also carries standard risks, although the odds of its success are greatly elevated when the only indication for it is an inborn error of metabolism. In the absence of a liver transplant, the MSUD diet must be adhered to strictly and permanently. However, in both treatment scenarios, with proper management, those affected can live healthy, normal lives without experiencing the severe neurological damage associated with the disease.[citation needed]\nControl of metabolism is vital during pregnancy of women with MSUD. To prevent detrimental abnormalities in the development of the embryo or fetus, dietary adjustments should be made and plasma amino acid concentrations of the mother should be observed carefully and frequently. Amino acid deficiency can be detected through fetal growth, making it essential to monitor development closely.[3] BCAA levels should be monitored strictly with the goal of maintaining normal levels in individuals with MSUD who are pregnant.[citation needed]\nOften times there was an increase in leucine levels about the target range through the whole course of the pregnancy. Pregnant individuals with MSUD can have healthy newborns which tells us that MSUD metabolites are unlikely to have teratogenic outcomes that lead to birth defects, developmental delays, or miscarriages.[30]",
    "Prognosis": "There are risks of long-term neurological effects from maple syrup urine disease.[31] These may include ADHD, anxiety, depression, etc.[11] The severity of these effects is dependent on the level of metabolic control. If left untreated, MSUD will lead to death due to central neurological function failure and respiratory failure. Early detection, protein-restricted diet low in branched-chain amino acids, close monitoring of blood chemistry, and aggressive treatment during a metabolic crisis can lead to a good prognosis with little or no abnormal developments.[32] Cognitive development may be shown to be below that of the general population. The severity of the cognitive delay is related to the time the condition remained undiagnosed and the effectiveness of dietary control including during metabolic crises.[26]",
    "Epidemiology": "MSUD is a historically rare metabolic disorder with a worldwide incidence rate of about one in 185,000 live births. However, certain founder populations are much more prone to MSUD. For example, the Old Order Mennonites of Pennsylvania, produce as many as one in 200 live birth with MSUD.[33]\nMaple syrup urine disease is classified as an autosomal recessive disorder and has a higher prevalence in populations that have higher consanguinity. Infants who are not treated for early onset MSUD experience a significant delay in development and usually die within a few months of birth. Younger children with late-onset MSUD may experience developmental delay also, depending on the enzyme activity of BKCD (branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase). In children with periods of increased protein catabolism, there is an increased risk for metabolic decompensation. Early diagnosis can prevent morbidity in most cases as long as correct treatment is administered at presentation and periods of possible metabolic decompensation. MSUD occurs in all ethnic groups and the sex of the infant/child does not play a role in prevalence.[34]\nNBS (newborn screening) programs incorporate MSUD screening in the United States, five provinces in Canada, Twenty-two European countries, eight Asian Pacific countries, and two Latin American countries.[33]"

    "Disease": "Mastocytosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "When mast cells undergo degranulation, the substances that are released can cause a number of symptoms that can vary over time and can range in intensity from mild to severe. Because mast cells play a role in allergic reactions, the symptoms of mastocytosis often are similar to the symptoms of an allergic reaction. They may include, but are not limited to[3]\nThere are few qualitative studies about the effects of mastocytosis on daily life. However, a Danish study from 2018 describes the multidimensional impact of the disease on everyday life.[6]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis of urticaria pigmentosa (cutaneous mastocytosis, see above) can often be done by seeing the characteristic lesions that are dark brown and fixed. A small skin sample (biopsy) may help confirm the diagnosis.[citation needed]\nIn case of suspicion of systemic disease the level of serum tryptase in the blood can be of help. If the base level of s-tryptase is elevated, this implies that the mastocytosis can be systemic. In cases of suspicion of SM help can also be drawn from analysis of mutation in KIT(D816V) in peripheral blood using sensitive PCR-technology[citation needed]\nTo set the diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis, certain criteria must be met. Either one major + one minor criterion or three minor criteria has to be fulfilled:[9]\nOther types of mast cell disease include:\nMastocytosis can occur in a variety of forms:\nCutaneous mastocytosis in children usually presents in the first year after birth and in most cases vanishes during adolescence.\nSystemic mastocytosis involves the bone marrow in the majority of cases and in some cases other internal organs, usually in addition to involving the skin. Mast cells collect in various tissues and can affect organs where mast cells do not normally inhabit such as the liver, spleen and lymph nodes, and organs which have normal populations but where numbers are increased. In the bowel, it may manifest as mastocytic enterocolitis.[15] However, normal ranges for mast cell counts in the gastrointestinal tract mucosa are not well established in the literature, and depend upon the exact location (e.g. right versus left colon), gender, and patient populations (such as asymptomatic patients versus patients with chronic diarrhea of unknown etiology).  Quantitative mast cell stains may yield little diagnostic information, and further research studies are warranted to determine whether \"mastocytic enterocolitis\" truly represents a distinct entity.[16]\nThere are five types of systemic mastocytosis:[9]",
    "Treatment": "There is no cure for mastocytosis, but there are a number of medicines to help treat the symptoms:[17]\nAntidepressants are an important and often overlooked tool in the treatment of mastocytosis. Depression and other neurological symptoms have been noted in mastocytosis.[4][19] Some antidepressants, such as doxepin and mirtazapine, are themselves potent antihistamines and can help relieve physical as well as cognitive symptoms.[citation needed]\nIn cases of advanced systemic mastocytosis or rare cases with indolent systemic mastocytosis with very troublesome symptoms, cytoreductive therapy can be indicated.[20]\nAllogeneic stem cell transplantation has been used in rare cases with aggressive systemic mastocytosis in patients deemed to be fit for the procedure.\nTreatment with ultraviolet light can relieve skin symptoms, but may increase the risk of skin cancer.[22]",
    "Prognosis": "Patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis have a normal life expectancy. The prognosis for patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis differs depending on type of disease with MCL being the most serious form with short survival.[20]",
    "Epidemiology": "The true incidence and prevalence of mastocytosis is unknown, but mastocytosis generally has been considered to be an \"orphan disease\"; orphan diseases affect 200,000 or fewer people in the United States. Mastocytosis, however, often may be misdiagnosed, as it typically occurs secondary to another condition, and thus may occur more frequently than assumed.[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "Meleda disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Skin on the palms of hands and soles of feet have dry, thick patches which progress slowly.[8] The skin that is affected may look red in color and then start becoming abnormally thick and scaly.[8] After birth it usually is obvious whether a child is affected with this disease because the hands or feet will appear to be peeling and could be red in color.[6][8]\nThere is not much variation in this disease besides the skin how red the skin will turn and how much skin will turn thicker.[8] The skin that is affected on the hands and feet can start to look like the affected person is wearing gloves or socks, this is because the affected area on the hands and feet go up to the wrists and ankles, respectively.[9]\nOther symptoms can include excessive sweating due to the thick skin affecting sweat glands on the skin; this excessive sweating can cause a person to have bad odor.[9] Severity of symptoms could increase as a person gets older.[8]",
    "Causes": "This is a skin disorder that is rare and inherited.[9] It caused by genetics and is an autosomal recessive trait therefore, in order to be affected and present the disease each parent must be a carrier of the mutated allele and pass it to their kids.[6] Inbreeding within families can cause Meleda disease to be prevalent.[9] Meleda disease can be associated with other skin conditions such as skin discoloration, skin thickness, and skin peeling.[6]",
    "Diagnosis": "The skin abnormalities can be found on a child at birth or during infancy.[7] The abnormalities on the soles of feet or on the palms of hands can be found by the physician during a full examination.[6] Family medical history can help with diagnosing because this is a genetically inherited disease. Overall, the diagnosis usually happens after birth because the majority of the time the child's hands and feet will be affected, making the condition apparent. Genetic testing can be done to determine whether there are mutations to confirm the disease.[9] There are similar diseases that affect the skin which also have to be taken into consideration before making a diagnosis.[citation needed]\nThese are different patterns of disorders that cause the thickening of the skin on the hands and feet:",
    "Treatment": "Treatment can consist of topical lotions, drug therapies, and surgery. Treatment varies from person to person depending on the severity of their symptoms. Treatment has been more successful with oral retinoids than with the use of topical lotions, applied directly to the affected skin.[6]\nAromatic Retinoid Etretinate used to be prescribed and had effective results in treating Meleda disease,[14] but was taken off of the market in 1998 in America due to toxic effects and the increased risk of birth defects. Aromatic Retinoid Etretinate is still sold in Japan under the name Tigason. In America, Etretinate was replaced by Acitretin, and is only used in severe cases due to the severe side effects.[15] If taking Acitretin it is advised to not donate blood or get pregnant for at least 3 years after taking the drug.[16]\nTopical lotions can help keep the skin moisturized, and help reduce flaking of the skin.[9] Generally these are safe to put on skin, but possible side effects can include irritation.[9]",
    "Prognosis": "With treatment the prognosis can be good for people with this disease.[9] Quality of life can be decreased, therefore getting treatment is recommended.[6] Too much dry skin can be painful for some and cause discomfort.[8] There is limited data on the life expectancy of an affected person, but this disease alone does not reduce a person's lifespan.",
    "Epidemiology": "Most cases of Meleda disease have been reported in and around the former Yugoslavia. It is estimated that there is one case per 100,000 people, who become affected with the disease.[8][7] Symptoms usually show up after birth and there are no differences in gender or ethnicity as to who can become affected.[7]\nThe disease is believed to have started on the Croatian island of Mljet, after people were quarantined on the island for having plague and other diseases in 1826.[9] On the island, inbreeding is believed to have occurred and Meleda disease became apparent.[9]"

    "Disease": "Menkes disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Affected infants may be born prematurely. Signs of the disease appear during infancy, typically after a two- to three-month period of normal or slightly slowed development that is followed by a loss of early developmental skills and subsequent developmental delay. Patients exhibit hypotonia (weak muscle tone), failure to thrive, hypothermia (subnormal body temperature), sagging facial features, seizures, and metaphyseal widening. Hair appears strikingly peculiar: kinky, colorless or silvery, and brittle. There can be extensive neurodegeneration in the gray matter of the brain.[8] Arteries in the brain can also be twisted with frayed and split inner walls. This can lead to rupture or blockage of the arteries. Weakened bones (osteoporosis) may result in fractures.[9]\nOccipital horn syndrome (sometimes called X-linked cutis laxa and previously called Ehlers-Danlos type 9[10]) is a mild form of Menkes syndrome that begins in early to middle childhood. It is characterized by calcium deposits in a bone at the base of the skull (occipital bone), coarse hair, and loose skin and joints.[11]",
    "Causes": "Mutations in the ATP7A gene, located on chromosome Xq21.1,[12] lead to Menkes syndrome.[13] This condition is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern.[14] About 30% of MNK cases are due to new mutations and 70% are inherited, almost always from the mother.[7] Even though the disease is more common in males, females can still be a carrier of the disease. As the result of a mutation in the ATP7A gene, copper is poorly distributed to cells in the body. Copper accumulates in some tissues, such as the small intestine and kidneys, while the brain and other tissues have unusually low levels. The decreased supply of copper can reduce the activity of numerous copper-containing enzymes that are necessary for the structure and function of bone, skin, hair, blood vessels and the nervous system such as lysyl oxidase.[15] As with other X-linked disorders, female children of a carrier mother have an even chance of carrying the disorder, but are normally well; male children have an even chance of having the disorder or of being free from it. A genetic counselor may have useful advice.[9]",
    "Diagnosis": "Menkes syndrome can be diagnosed by blood tests of the copper and ceruloplasmin levels, skin biopsy, and optical microscopic examination of the hair to view characteristic Menkes abnormalities. X-rays of the skull and skeleton are conducted to look for abnormalities in bone formation.[7] Urine homovanillic acid/vanillylmandelic acid ratio has been proposed as a screening tool to support earlier detection.[18][19] Since 70% of MNK cases are inherited, genetic testing of the mother can be performed to search for a mutation in the ATP7A gene.[20]",
    "Treatment": "There is no cure for Menkes disease. Early treatment with injections of copper supplements (acetate or glycinate) may be of some slight benefit. 11 of 12 newborns who were diagnosed with MNK were alive at age 4.6.[21] Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treatments to help relieve some of the symptoms includes pain medication, anti-seizure medication, feeding tube when necessary, and physical and occupational therapy.[21] The earlier treatment is given, the better the prognosis.[22]",
    "Epidemiology": "One European study reported a rate of 1 in 254,000;[23] a Japanese study reported a rate of 1 in 357,143.[24] No correlation with other inherited characteristics, or with ethnic origin, is known.[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "Metachondromatosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Metachondromatosis is identified by the presence of both multiple enchondromas and osteochondromas in the patient, although other less characteristic symptoms are often associated with the disease.  The symptoms usually become apparent in the first 10 years of life and disappear later in life.[8] The symptoms of Metachondromatosis are seen as follows:\nEnchondromas are benign tumors present on the inside of bones. In Metachondromatosis, enchondromas involves the iliac crests and metaphyses of long bones, often the proximal femur. Usually, these tumors are painless; however, when present in the hands or feet, or in multiple lesions, as typically seen, bone deformity can occur.[8]\nOsteochondromas are benign tumors located on the surface of bone near growth plates.  These tumors also often in the hands and feet, primarily affecting the digits of fingers and toes.  These tumors tend to subside after 10-20 years of life.[8]  These tumors can become painful if they pressure sensitive tissue or nerves.[8]  Metachondromatosis is differentiated from hereditary multiple osteochondromas by the location of the location of Osteochondromas tumors as well as the lack of bone-shortening.[8]\nThe epiphysis is the rounded end part of bone.  The structure of the epiphysis can be abnormal in metachondromatosis[citation needed].\nThe metaphysis is wide portion of a long bone, and also has abnormal structure in the disease.[citation needed]\nAvascular necrosis is the death of bone due to a decreased blood supply.[citation needed]\nPeople with metachondromatosis often experience bone pain due to abnormal bone shapes.[citation needed]\nCranial nerve paralysis can affect the functions associated with the cranial nerve.[9]",
    "Diagnosis": "Because of its rarity, metachondromatosis is often a difficult disease to recognize and diagnose. Diagnosis can be made based on clinical observations and radiographic findings as well as family history.[12] Using radiographic methods, osteochondromas can be seen at the metaphyses of the short tubular bones, such as those in the hands and feet, pointing towards the joints.[6] Enchondromas would also be visible along with the osteochondromas. The differential diagnosis includes hereditary multiple osteochondromas. This is a condition in which the long bones are primarily affected, and the lesions point away from the joint or growth plate. This may also result in the shortening or deformity of the affected bones.[6] Since metachondromatosis is hereditary, genetic counseling can be offered to patients and their families. Some available genetic tests for metachondromatosis are sequence analysis of the entire coding region, targeted variant analysis, deletion/duplication analysis, and a sequence analysis of select exons associated with the disorder.[13]",
    "Treatment": "Osteochondromas are usually painless, and in many cases, they spontaneously regress after the first or second decade of life. Most patients are asymptomatic, making medical intervention unnecessary. However, in extreme cases such as severe malalignment of the fingers and toes, surgery can be used to remove the osteochondromas.[6]",
    "Epidemiology": "Metachondromatosis is very rare, occurring in less than 1 in 1,000,000 people. Fewer than 40 cases have been reported around the world to date.[6][14]"

    "Disease": "Metachromatic leukodystrophy",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Like many other genetic disorders that affect lipid metabolism, there are several forms of MLD, which are late infantile, juvenile, and adult.[citation needed]\nPalliative care can help with many of the symptoms and usually improves the quality of life and longevity.[citation needed]\nCarriers have low enzyme levels compared to their family population (\"normal\" levels vary from family to family) but even low enzyme levels are adequate to process the body's sulfatide.[citation needed]",
    "Causes": "MLD is directly caused by a deficiency of the enzyme arylsulfatase A[3] (ARSA) and is characterized by enzyme activity in leukocytes that is less than 10% of normal controls.[4] However, assay of the ARSA enzyme activity alone is not sufficient for diagnosis; ARSA pseudodeficiency, which is characterized by enzyme activity that is 5~20% of normal controls does not cause MLD.[4] Without this enzyme, sulfatides build up in many tissues of the body, eventually destroying the myelin sheath of the nervous system. The myelin sheath is a fatty covering that protects nerve fibers. Without it, the nerves in the brain (central nervous system – CNS) and the peripheral nerves (peripheral nervous system – PNS) which control, among other things the muscles related to mobility, cease to function properly.[citation needed]\nArylsulfatase A is activated by saposin B (Sap B), a non-enzymatic proteinaceous cofactor.[5]  When the arylsulfatase A enzyme level is normal but the sulfatides are still high – meaning that they are not being broken down because the enzyme is not activated – the resulting disease is saposin B deficiency, which presents similar to MLD.[4] Saposin B deficiency is very rare, much more rare than traditional MLD.[4] The enzyme that is present is not \"enabled\" to a normal level of efficiency and can't break down the sulfatides which results in all of the same MLD symptoms and progression.[6]\nA 2011 study contended sulfatide is not completely responsible for MLD because it is non-toxic. It has been suggested that lysosulfatide, sulfatide which has had its acyl group removed, plays a role because of its cytotoxic properties in vitro.[7]",
    "Diagnosis": "Clinical examination and MRI are often the first steps in an MLD diagnosis.  MRI can be indicative of MLD but is not adequate as a confirming test. An ARSA-A enzyme level blood test with a confirming urinary sulfatide test is the best biochemical test for MLD. Urinary sulfatide is important to distinguish between MLD and pseudo-MLD blood results. Genomic sequencing may also confirm MLD, however, there are likely more mutations than the over 200 already known to cause MLD that are not yet ascribed to MLD that cause MLD so in those cases a biochemical test is still warranted.[citation needed]\nMLD Foundation formally launched a newborn screening initiative in late 2017. The screen development started in the early 2010s at the University of Washington, by Professor Michael H. Gelb.  A deidentified pilot study was launched in April 2016 in Washington state. Positive results led to MLD being included in the ScreenPlus identified baby research project in New York state, which is currently scheduled to launch in Q1'2021.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "There is currently no approved treatment for MLD in symptomatic late infantile patients or for juvenile and adult-onset with advanced symptoms. There is a treatment for pre-symptomatic patients and certain others with the condition.\nSymptomatic patients typically receive clinical treatment focused on pain and symptom management.[citation needed]Pre-symptomatic late infantile MLD patients, as well as those with juvenile or adult MLD that are either presymptomatic or displaying mild symptoms, can consider bone marrow transplantation (including stem cell transplantation), which may slow down the progression of the disease in the central nervous system.[citation needed] However, results in the peripheral nervous system have been less dramatic, and the long-term results of these therapies have been mixed.[citation needed]\nIn 2020 the European Medical Agency approved the cell therapy drug atidarsagene autotemcel (Libmeldy) for the treatment of infantile and juvenile forms of metachromatic leukodystrophy in Europe.[11] In 2024 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved atidarsagene autotemcel (Lenmeldy) for use with pre-symptomatic late infantile, pre-symptomatic early juvenile or early symptomatic juvenile metachromatic leukodystrophy.[12]\nPresymptomatic patients can be cured with one treatment of atidarsagene autotemcel, which is a type of advanced medicine called a ‘gene therapy’. This type of medicine works by delivering genes into the body. The active substance in atidarsagene autotemcel is CD34+ stem cells. They are retrieved from the patient's own bone marrow or blood. They are then modified to contain a copy of the gene to make functional ARSA. After confirming that the cells contain an active copy of the gene, they are injected into the patient's bone marrow. CD34+ cells can divide to produce other sorts of blood cells.[11]\nSeveral therapy options are currently being investigated using clinical trials primarily in late infantile patients. These therapies include gene therapy, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), substrate reduction therapy (SRT), and potentially enzyme enhancement therapy (EET). In addition to the clinical trials, there are several other pre-clinical gene therapy research projects underway.[citation needed]",
    "Epidemiology": "The incidence of metachromatic leukodystrophy is estimated to occur in 1 in 40,000 to 1 in 160,000 individuals worldwide.[13] There is a much higher incidence in certain genetically isolated populations, such as 1 in 75 in Habbanites (a small group of Jews who immigrated to Israel from southern Arabia), 1 in 2,500 in the western portion of the Navajo Nation, and 1 in 8,000 among Arab groups in Israel.[13]\nAs an autosomal recessive disease, 1 in 40,000 equates to a 1 in 100 carrier frequency in the general population.[14]\nIn the US, there are an estimated 3,600 MLD births per year, with 1,900 alive; in Europe 3,100, and worldwide 49,000 alive.[14]\nMLD is considered a rare disease in the US and other countries.[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "Metaphyseal dysplasia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "It is an autosomal recessive disorder in which mild clinical manifestations contrast with radiological appearances of gross metaphyseal undermodeling. Most patients present with mild genu valgum. The elbows are unable to extend fully. There may be widening of the lower femora and clavicles. Bones can sometimes be fragile, but fracturing is usually not common. Patients may present with dental caries, mandibular prognathism, spinal alignment, and disproportionate limb lengthening. Mental development, physical development, and height are usually normal.[4] Most patients with Pyle's diseases will have symptoms that vary from person to person. Symptoms are:[5]\n5%–29% of people have\nOther people may have",
    "Causes": "Pyle disease is caused by mutations in the SFRP4 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that blocks (inhibits) a process called Wnt signaling, which is involved in the development of several tissues and organs throughout the body. In particular, regulation of Wnt signaling by the SFRP4 protein is critical for normal bone development and remodeling. Bone remodeling is a normal process in which old bone is broken down and new bone is created to replace it. Mutations in the SFRP4 gene are thought to prevent the production of functional SFRP4 protein. The resulting dysregulation of Wnt signaling leads to the bone abnormalities characteristic of Pyle disease.[3]\nPyle disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the SFRP4 gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene. While they do not develop the condition, they may have mild abnormalities of the long bones.[5][3]",
    "Diagnosis": "There are two clinical molecular genetic test that are available to those thought to have Pyle’s Disease. Theses test are; Sequence analysis of the entire coding region and Deletion/duplication analysis.[3][6]\nPyle disease may be confused with craniometaphyseal dysplasia. The two, however, are clinically, radiographically, and genetically distinct from one another.[7]",
    "Treatment": "People with Pyle disease are often asymptomatic. Dental anomalies may require orthodontic interventions. Skeletal anomalies may require orthopedic surgery.[8]",
    "Epidemiology": "Pyle disease is thought to be a rare disorder, although its prevalence is unknown. More than 25 cases have been described in the medical literature.[3]\nIt has been described in four German families originating from the same town in Bohemia and in a 7-year-old Japanese girl.[9]"

    "Disease": "Methylmalonic acidemias",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Depending on the affected gene(s) and mutation, the present symptoms can range from mild to life-threatening.\nAs a rule, methylmalonic acidemias are not apparent at birth as symptoms do not present themselves until proteins are added to the infant's diet.[10] Because of this, symptoms typically manifest anytime within the first year of life.[12] However, there are also forms that only develop symptoms in adulthood.[4]",
    "Causes": "Methylmalonic acidemias have an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, which means the defective gene is located on an autosome, and two copies of the gene—one from each parent—must be inherited to be affected by the disorder. The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are carriers of one copy of the defective gene, but are usually not affected by the disorder.[citation needed] The exception is methylmalonic acidemia and homocystinuria, cblX type due to variants in HCFC1 gene, which is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner.[13]\nThe following are the known genotypes responsible for isolated methylmalonic acidemias:[13]\nThe mut type can further be divided into mut0 and mut- subtypes, with mut0 characterized by a complete lack of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and more severe symptoms and mut- characterized by a decreased amount of mutase activity.[5]\nFurthermore, the following genes are also responsible for methylmalonic acidemias:[13][19]\nThough not always grouped together with the inherited versions, a severe nutritional vitamin B12 deficiency can also result in syndrome with identical symptoms and treatments as the genetic methylmalonic acidemias.[37] Methylmalonyl-CoA requires vitamin B12 to form succinyl-CoA. When the amount of B12 is insufficient for the conversion of cofactor methylmalonyl-CoA into succinyl-CoA, the buildup of unused methylmalonyl-CoA eventually leads to methylmalonic acidemia. This diagnosis is often used as an indicator of vitamin B12 deficiency in serum.[38]",
    "Diagnosis": "Due to the severity and rapidity with which this disorder can cause complications when left undiagnosed, screening for methylmalonic acidemias is often included in the newborn screening exam.[10][45] For this purpose, a dried blood spot test for the parameter propionylcarnitine (C3) is carried out at the age of 24–48 hours in order to detect isolated methylmalonic acidemias.[13][46]\nDue to normal propionylcarnitine levels and asymptomatic symptoms at the time of testing, the probably most common form of methylmalonic acidemias, CMAMMA, slips through the newborn screening.[9][13] The autosomal recessive intellectual development disorder 69 also has normal propionylcarnitine levels.[13] Methylmalonic acidemia and homocystinuria, cblC type, if mild and with late onset, can also slip through.[47]\nTypically, the parameter methylmalonic acid is only tested if propionylcarnitine was previously elevated.[48]\nBecause of the inability to properly break down amino acids completely, the byproduct of protein digestion, the compound methylmalonic acid, is found in a disproportionate concentration in the blood and urine of those afflicted. These abnormal levels are the main diagnostic criterion for diagnosing the disorder. This disorder is typically determined through the use of a urine analysis or blood panel.[12] Elevated levels of ammonia, glycine, and ketone bodies may also be present in the blood and urine.[6]\nWith the inclusion of the parameter malonic acid, CMAMMA can be quickly differentiated from classic methylmalonic acidemia by calculating the ratio of malonic acid to methylmalonic acid, but only with values from the blood plasma and not from the urine.[49] The ratio can then also be used to determine whether it is CMAMMA (MA<MMA) or malonic aciduria (MA>MMA).[49][7][50]\nThe test is used for further differential diagnosis and to check the effectiveness of treatment with vitamin B12, the latter can prevent unnecessary injections (of vitamin B12) in children.[51] For better comparability and interpretation of patient reports, Fowler et al. have developed a protocol for a standardized vitamin B12 responsiveness test (in vivo):[51]\nFurthermore, vitamin B12 responsiveness can also be tested in vitro.[13][51] It can provide some insights, but it cannot always correctly predict in vivo vitamin B12 responsiveness.[13]\nThe final diagnosis is confirmed by molecular genetic testing if biallelic pathogenic variants are found in the affected gene(s). Due to their high sensitivity, accessibility, and non-invasiveness, molecular genetic tests have replaced enzyme assays in most cases.[13] There are specific multigene panels for methylmalonic acidemias, but the particular genes tested may vary from laboratory to laboratory and can be customized by the clinician to the individual phenotype.[13][19] The molecular genetic methods used in these panels range from sequence analysis, deletion/duplication analysis and other non-sequencing based tests, but in the vast majority of cases the diagnosis is made by sequence analysis.[13]\nFurthermore, molecular genetic tests are necessary to check suspected diagnoses and correct misdiagnoses that may have been caused by misleading symptoms and results of the vitamin B12 responsiveness test.[52]\nThe presence of methylmalonic acidemia can also be suspected through the use of a CT or MRI scan, however, these tests are by no means specific and require clinical and metabolic/correlation.[10]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment for all forms of this condition primarily relies on a low-protein diet, and depending on what variant of the disorder the individual suffers from, various dietary supplements. All variants respond to the levo isomer of carnitine as the improper breakdown of the affected substances results in sufferers developing a carnitine deficiency. The carnitine also assists in the removal of acyl-CoA, a buildup of which is common in low-protein diets, by converting it into acyl-carnitine, which can be excreted in urine. Some forms of methylmalonyl acidemia are responsive to cobalamin, although cyanocobalamin supplements could prove detrimental to some forms.[53] If the individual proves responsive to both cobalamin and carnitine supplements, then it may be possible for them to ingest substances that include small amounts of the problematic amino acids isoleucine, threonine, methionine, and valine without causing an attack.[10] CblA und cblB versions of methylmalonic acidemia are cobalamin-responsive.[citation needed]\nA more extreme treatment includes a kidney or liver transplant from a donor without the condition. The foreign organs will produce a functional version of the defective enzymes and digest the methylmalonic acid, however all of the disadvantages of organ transplantation are of course applicable in this situation.[10] There is evidence to suggest that the central nervous system may metabolize methylmalonyl-CoA in a system isolated from the rest of the body. If this is the case, transplantation may not reverse the neurological effects of methylmalonic acid before the transplant or prevent further damage to the brain by continued buildup.[54][40]\nPreclinical proof-of-concept studies in animal models have shown that mRNA therapy is also suitable for rare metabolic diseases, including isolated methylmalonic acidemia.[55][56] In this context, the mut methylmalonic acidemia therapy candidate mRNA-3705 from the biotechnology company Moderna, which is currently in phase 1/2, is worth mentioning.[57]\nThe investigational small molecular therapeutic HST5040 from HemoShear Therapeutics for methylmalonic aciduria and propionic aciduria, which is currently in phase 2, should be mentioned here.[58][59] Taken daily orally or by gastric tube, it is designed to prevent toxic accumulation of propionyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA or their derivatives by shunting CoA away from the propionyl-CoA pathway, leading to normal or near-normal levels of these metabolites and potentially improving metabolic state and energy-producing pathways.[60][59]\nAnother small molecule therapeutic in development is BBP-671 from BridgeBio Pharma for pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), propionic and methylmalonic acidemias, which is currently in phase 1.[61] By allosterically activating pantothenate kinases, BBP-671 is expected to increase the production of CoA from vitamin B5 and thus normalize metabolic processes.[62]",
    "Prognosis": "Though there are no distinct stages of the disease, methylmalonic acidemia is a progressive condition; the symptoms of this disorder are compounded as the concentration of methylmalonic acid increases. If the triggering proteins and fats are not removed from the diet, this buildup can lead to irreparable kidney or liver damage and eventually death.[10]\nThe prognosis will vary depending on the severity of the condition and the individual's response to treatment. Prognosis is typically better for those with cobalamin-responsive variants and not promising in those suffering from non-cobalamin-responsive variants.[40] Milder variants have a higher frequency of appearance in the population than the more severe ones.[12] Even with dietary modification and continued medical care, it may not be possible to prevent neurological damage in those with a nonresponsive acidemia.[40] Without proper treatment or diagnosis, it is not uncommon for the first acidemic attack to be fatal.[10]\nDespite these challenges, since it was first identified in 1967, treatment and understanding of the condition has improved to the point where it is not unheard of for even those with unresponsive forms of methylmalonic acidemia to be able to reach adulthood and even carry and deliver children safely.[54]"

    "Disease": "Microphthalmia",
    "Causes": "It has been postulated that microphthalmia arises as a result of interference with postnatal eye growth, in contrast to anophthalmia which originates much earlier during fetal development.\nGenetic causes of microphthalmia include chromosomal abnormalities (e.g. Patau syndrome, mosaic trisomy 9, 13q deletion syndrome, Wolf–Hirschhorn syndrome) or monogenetic Mendelian disorders (e.g. CHARGE syndrome, Fraser syndrome, oculofaciocardiodental syndrome, Lenz microphthalmia syndrome).[3][7]\nMicrophthalmia in newborns is sometimes associated with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder[2] or infections during pregnancy, particularly herpes simplex virus, rubella and cytomegalovirus (CMV), but the evidence is inconclusive.[3]\nThe following genes, many of which are transcription and regulatory factors, have been implicated in microphthalmia, anophthalmia, and coloboma:[8][9][10]\nSOX2 has been implicated in a substantial number (10–15%) of cases and in many other cases failure to develop the ocular lens often results in microphthalmia.[3]\nMicrophthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), located on chromosome 14q32, is associated with one form of isolated microphthalmia (MCOP1). In mammals, the failure of expression of MITF in the retinal pigment epithelium prevents this structure from fully differentiating, causing a malformation of the choroid fissure of the eye and drainage of vitreous body fluid. Without this fluid, the eye fails to enlarge, resulting in microphthalmia. Waardenburg syndrome type 2 in humans may also be caused by mutations in MITF[11] The human MITF gene is homologous to the mouse microphthalmia gene (gene symbol mi); mouse with mutations in this gene are hypopigmented in their fur. The identification of the genetics of WS type 2 owes a lot to observations of phenotypes of MITF-mutant mice.[11]",
    "Diagnosis": "Microphthalmia is often diagnosed soon after birth. An initial diagnosis usually occurs after the eyes are inspected through the lids.[3] In addition to visual examinations, measurements of the cornea are used in the diagnosis of this condition.[3] An ultrasound may also be conducted to confirm whether the axial length of the eye is clinically below average (i.e. at least 2 standard deviations below the age-adjusted mean).[3][5]\nWhen a case of microphthalmia is detected, the patient should visit an eye specialist as soon as possible. It is important for an ophthalmologist to conduct a thorough examination within 2 weeks after birth.[13] The ophthalmologist will confirm the preliminary diagnosis and look for signs of other anomalies in both eyes. These abnormalities may include coloboma, optic nerve hypoplasia, retinal dystrophy, and cataract.[13] Ultrasound may also be used to determine the presence of any internal eye issues, which may not otherwise be visible.[13] It is possible for individuals with microphthalmia to have some vision in the affected eye(s). For this reason, the vision of infants with microphthalmia should be evaluated early on, even in severe cases.[13] Pediatric vision tests along with electrodiagnostics are typically used to assess visual acuity.[13]\nIf no related symptoms are present, microphthalmia is defined as non-syndromic or isolated microphthalmia (MCOP). When occurring in conjunction with other developmental defects, it may be diagnosed as syndromic microphthalmia (MCOPS). Approximately 60 to 80% of microphthalmia cases are syndromic.[14] Several types of MCOPS have been recognized based on their genetic causes:",
    "Treatment": "Microphthalmia cannot be cured. However, there are treatments options to manage the condition and its associated symptoms. When the affected eye(s) display some visual function, a patient's eyesight can be improved (sometimes up to good state) by plus lenses, as a small eye is usually far-sighted.[13] When one of the eyes is unaffected, caution should be taken to guard this 'good' eye and preserve its vision. In these unilateral cases, eye glasses may be worn to offer a measure of physical protection.[3][13]\nA key aspect of managing this condition is accounting for the small volume of the eye. The small orbit size characteristic of microphthalmia can impact the growth and structural development of the face after birth. As a result, microphthalmia can cause hemifacial asymmetry.[3][13] This possibility is a particular concern for individuals with unilateral cases of microphthalmia. With one eye of average size, the asymmetry often becomes much more severe as the child ages.[13] An axial length of less than 16 mm (0.63 in) indicates that a microphthalmic eye's growth will not be sufficient, and intervention will be necessary to reduce the degree of facial asymmetry.[13]\nMinimizing facial asymmetry is important for cosmetic and structural reasons.[3][5][13] In order to address the size discrepancy of the affected eye(s), it is important to begin eye socket expansion early in life. The face reaches 70% of its adult size by roughly 2 years of age, and 90% of its adult size by about 5.5 years of age.[13] Additionally, the symmetry fostered by early socket expansion allows for a better prosthetic fit later in life.[5][13] Typically, an infant begins wearing a conformer, or an unpainted ocular prosthesis, in the first weeks of life.[3][5][13] The conformer is repeatedly replaced with a prothesis of a slightly larger size. This process, which takes place during the first 5 years of life, gradually enlarges the eye socket.[3][5][13] Socket expansion through the use of implants of increasing size is another effective strategy.[3][13]\nAfter socket expansion is complete, a painted prosthetic eye can be worn for cosmetic reasons.[13] If the microphthalmic eye has functional vision, an affected individual may opt against wearing a painted prothesis. Lenses are also sometimes used for cosmetic purposes, such as a plus lens to enlarge the microphthalmic eye.[13]",
    "Epidemiology": "Microphthalmia and anophthalmia combined are estimated to occur in about 1 in 10,000 births,[19] though estimates have varied from 2 and 23 in 100,000 births. Approximately 3–11% of all blind children born globally have microphthalmia.[14]"

    "Disease": "Miller%E2%80%93Dieker syndrome",
    "Causes": "MDS is a microdeletion syndrome involving loss of the gene PAFAH1B1 on chromosome 17 which is responsible for the syndrome's characteristic sign of lissencephaly. The loss of another gene, YWHAE, in the same region of chromosome 17 increases the severity of the lissencephaly in patients with Miller–Dieker syndrome. Additional genes in the deleted region are likely to contribute to the varied features of Miller–Dieker syndrome.[4]\nIt may be a random event during the formation of reproductive cells or in early fetal development or due to familial chromosomal rearrangement called chromosomal translocation. In less than 20% of cases an unaffected parent carries a particular chromosomal rearrangement called a balanced translocation, in which no genetic material is gained or lost. Increased rate of unexplained fetal loss may be observed in those who have these suspectible balanced translocations although they may be otherwise asymptomatic.[5] However, these translocations can become also unbalanced as they are passed to the next generation. Miller–Dieker syndrome is usually not inherited. The deletion event occurs randomly during gametogenesis (formation of eggs or sperm) or in early foetal development.[citation needed] Therefore, no history of the disorder is usually seen in their families.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "The disease may be diagnosed by cytogenetic techniques like fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), testing for a microdeletion at LIS1.[6]\nWith the use of prenatal ultrasonographic imaging, early detection of abnormal brain development in the fetus with MDS can be seen. At birth, facial dysmorphism can be present in the infant. Young children, when affected, can have feeding difficulties, severe intellectual disability, developmental delay, and seizures. MRI facilitates early detection of this syndrome in children by revealing a \"smooth brain\" image, also called lissencephaly.[7]\nChildren with this syndrome may remain underdiagnosed because of rarity and the prevalence of facial features that appear to be dysmorphic. The syndrome shares distinct external features (phenotype) similar to more common syndromes. Lack of relevant family history may delay diagnosis.\nFDNA provides a service that in turn increases the chances of detecting these distinct characteristics, which, when shown to a geneticist, can assist in reaching the right medical diagnosis.\nIf a couple has had one child with MDS, they can be offered prenatal screening in future pregnancies. This option is particularly important for the few (less than 20%) MDS families where one parent carries a balanced chromosome rearrangement. The risk of these couples having another child with MDS depends on the exact type of chromosomal rearrangement present and may be as high as 25–33%. For families in which both parents' chromosomes are normal, the risk of having another child with MDS is low (1% or less). Either chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis can be used early in a pregnancy to obtain a small sample of cells from the developing embryo for chromosome studies. Early prenatal diagnosis by ultrasound is not reliable because the brain is normally smooth until later in pregnancy. Couples who are considering prenatal diagnosis are usually advised to discuss the risks and benefits of this type of testing with a geneticist or genetic counselor.[citation needed]\nThe brain is usually grossly abnormal in outline when someone is diagnosed with Miller–Dieker syndrome. Only a few shallow sulci and shallow Sylvian fissures are seen; this takes on an hourglass or figure-8 appearance on the axial imaging. The thickness and measurement for a person without MDS is 3–4 mm. With MDS, a person's cortex is measured at 12–20 mm.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "While no cure for MDS is available yet, many complications associated with this condition can be treated, and a great deal can be done to support or compensate for functional disabilities. Because of the diversity of the symptoms, it can be necessary to see a number of different specialists and undergo various examinations, including:[citation needed]\nThis disease is fairly uncommon, and treatment is scarce.",
    "Prognosis": "Most individuals with this condition do not survive beyond childhood. Individuals with MDS usually die in infancy and therefore do not live to the age where they can reproduce and transmit MDS to their offspring.\nDue to more accurate diagnosis by MRI and improved management of symptoms with medical treatments including gastrostomy (feeding tubes), suction machines, seizure medications, tracheostomy, and management of secretions, more children are surviving into adulthood and have a better quality of life. Development of skills and core strength may be improved with physical therapy, but improvement is limited by the severity of the condition. Some children may be able to sit up, crawl, or say a few basic words, but most are severely developmentally delayed and remain at the level of infants for their lifetime.  At all ages the most common cause of death is pneumonia, often after multiple cases have weakened the respiratory function.[4]",

    "Disease": "Mitochondrial complex II deficiency",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Mitochondrial complex II deficiency affects the body's mitochondria[3] and can have a variety of presentations. In some cases, the brain, peripheral nervous system, heart, liver, kidneys, and muscles are affected, while in other cases, only a subset of these organs are affected.[4] The condition can present differently among different individuals, even those in the same family, but symptoms can largely be separated into two categories. Those with biallelic loss of function who don't have any functional SDH have an average age of onset of 8.6 ± 7.9 months, while those with monoallelic loss of function have an average age of onset of 21.5 ± 20.3 years.[1] In the biallelic form, there is typically a Leigh syndrome phenotype with symptoms including seizures, white matter lesions, nystagmus, developmental delay, microcephaly, leukodystrophy, hypertonia, multiorgan failure, spasticity, tetraparesis, and more. In the monallelic form, often caused by heterozygous mutations of SDHA, symptoms include exercise intolerance, rhabdomyolosis, muscle pain, dyspnea, hypertension, dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and optic atrophy.[1]",
    "Causes": "CII deficiency is a genetic disorder caused by Nuclear DNA (as opposed to mitochondrial DNA) and has both autosomal recessive and dominant inheritance patterns. Most pathogenic mutations for CII deficiency occur on SDHA or SDHAF1, but other pathogenic mutations for CII are known for SDHB and SDHD. SDHA is the only SDHx gene reported to date in which a dominant pathogenic variant has been identified, although most affected individuals harbour either homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic variants.[1]\nFor unknown reasons, several cases of CII deficiency have been linked to Umeå, Sweden.[5]",
    "Diagnosis": "The most effective way to diagnose CII deficiency is by measuring the activity of complex II in muscle biopsy, however, there is no clear correlation between residual complex II activity and severity or clinical outcome.[4] Other diagnostic tests include brain MRIs, which can detect symptoms characteristic of leigh syndrome, electromyography (EMG), which can detect myopathies, and blood tests for biochemical signals of mitochondrial dysfunction.",
    "Prognosis": "The prognosis can vary wildly for CII deficiency: In those who present earlier, the prognosis is worse, and especially for the biallelic form, few reach the age of 4.[1] Those presenting with Leigh syndrome or greater neurological involvement have worse outcomes. In severe cases where multiple organ systems are affected, death can occur in early life due to multisystem failure.[2]\nThere is no cure for CII deficiency, though some reported patients showed clinical improvement following riboflavin therapy, a vitamin essential for mitochondrial function.[6] Vitamins, such as the other B vitamins and Coenzyme Q-10, have been used with little success, and treatments primarily focus on symptoms, such as sodium bicarbonate for managing acidosis and opthamological procedures for correcting eyesight.[citation needed]",
    "Epidemiology": "CII deficiency is extremely rare, with less than 100 documented cases worldwide.[1][7] Most cases recorded in literature are due to the biallelic form, and these are most common for those whose parents are consanguineous. There are potentially more cases of the monallelic form, but possibly due to their less severe nature or less unique presentation, they may not be reported as frequently. As human mitochondrial diseases and the effects of herbicides and fungicides on the mitochondria are a current area of research, our understanding of CII deficiency may progress significantly.[1]"

    "Disease": "Monilethrix",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Some indicators of monilethrix are small bumps on the skin, mainly on the scalp, neck and arms. In most cases, firm, dark papules, covered with dark scales and crusts appears on the skin, especially the scalp.[6] The affected individual would have beaded hair strands. The possible areas for the hair loss are the eyebrows, eyelashes, limbs, and pubic region. Hair strands are usually dull, dry, and brittle. The strands are prone to mild to severe breakage, causing onset alopecia, especially during pregnancy. Fingernail and toenails tend to appear abnormal.[7] The onset for this disease varies from person to person. The frequency of monilethrix is currently unknown.",
    "Diagnosis": "Monilethrix may be diagnosed with trichoscopy[8][9] and other forms of dermoscopy. Light microscopic examination is diagnostic and reveals elliptical nodes of normal thickness and intermittent constrictions, internodes at which the hair easily breaks. Under examination, the hair is beaded. The beading is the result of a periodic narrowing of the shaft with nodes separated by about 0.7 mm.[10] In general, there is a tendency for spontaneous improvement with time, especially during puberty and pregnancy, but the condition never disappears completely.[11]",
    "Treatment": "No specific treatment exists for monilethrix. Spontaneous resolution following puberty has occurred in some cases. In affected females, the condition improves during pregnancy. Genetic counseling will be of benefit for affected individuals and their families. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive.[6]",
    "Epidemiology": "Currently, the frequency for this disease is unknown and affects both men and women. Signs and symptoms either show up spontaneously at birth or around the age of 2.[6] The symptoms may change or remain the same throughout one's life, but are usually present after the first few months after birth."

    "Disease": "Motor neuron diseases",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Signs and symptoms depend on the specific disease, but motor neuron diseases typically manifest as a group of movement-related symptoms.[6] They come on slowly, and worsen over the course of more than three months. Various patterns of muscle weakness are seen, and muscle cramps and spasms may occur. One can have difficulty breathing with climbing stairs (exertion), difficulty breathing when lying down (orthopnea), or even respiratory failure if breathing muscles become involved. Bulbar symptoms, including difficulty speaking (dysarthria), difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), and excessive saliva production (sialorrhea), can also occur. Sensation, or the ability to feel, is typically not affected. Emotional disturbance (e.g. pseudobulbar affect) and cognitive and behavioural changes (e.g. problems in word fluency, decision-making, and memory) are also seen.[2][6] There can be lower motor neuron findings (e.g. muscle wasting, muscle twitching), upper motor neuron findings (e.g. brisk reflexes, Babinski reflex, Hoffman's reflex, increased muscle tone), or both.[6]\nMotor neuron diseases are seen both in children and adults.[2] Those that affect children tend to be inherited or familial, and their symptoms are either present at birth or appear before learning to walk. Those that affect adults tend to appear after age 40.[2] The clinical course depends on the specific disease, but most progress or worsen over the course of months.[6] Some are fatal (e.g. ALS), while others are not (e.g. PLS).[2]\nVarious patterns of muscle weakness occur in different motor neuron diseases.[6] Weakness can be symmetric or asymmetric, and it can occur in body parts that are distal, proximal, or both. According to Statland et al., there are three main weakness patterns that are seen in motor neuron diseases, which are:[6][9]\nMotor neuron diseases are on a spectrum in terms of upper and lower motor neuron involvement.[6] Some have just lower or upper motor neuron findings, while others have a mix of both. Lower motor neuron (LMN) findings include muscle atrophy and fasciculations, and upper motor neuron (UMN) findings include hyperreflexia, spasticity, muscle spasm, and abnormal reflexes.[2][6]\nPure upper motor neuron diseases, or those with just UMN findings, include PLS.[10]\nPure lower motor neuron diseases, or those with just LMN findings, include PMA.[11]\nMotor neuron diseases with both UMN and LMN findings include both familial and sporadic ALS.[12]",
    "Causes": "Most cases are sporadic and their causes are usually not known.[2] It is thought that environmental, toxic, viral, or genetic factors may be involved.[2]\nTAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), is a critical component of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) enzymatic pathway that repairs DNA double-strand breaks in pluripotent stem cell-derived motor neurons.[13] TDP-43 is rapidly recruited to double-strand breaks where it acts as a scaffold for the recruitment of the XRCC4-DNA ligase protein complex that then acts to repair double-strand breaks. About 95% of ALS patients have abnormalities in the nucleus-cytoplasmic localization in spinal motor neurons of TDP43. In TDP-43 depleted human neural stem cell-derived motor neurons, as well as in sporadic ALS patients' spinal cord specimens there is significant double-strand break accumulation and reduced levels of NHEJ.[13]\nIn adults, men are more commonly affected than women.[2]",
    "Diagnosis": "Differential diagnosis can be challenging due to the number of overlapping symptoms, shared between several motor neuron diseases.[14] Frequently, the diagnosis is based on clinical findings (i.e. LMN vs. UMN signs and symptoms, patterns of weakness), family history of MND, and a variation of tests, many of which are used to rule out disease mimics, which can manifest with identical symptoms.[15]\nMotor neuron disease describes a collection of clinical disorders, characterized by progressive muscle weakness and the degeneration of the motor neuron on electrophysiological testing. The term \"motor neuron disease\" has varying meanings in different countries. Similarly, the literature inconsistently classifies which degenerative motor neuron disorders can be included under the umbrella term \"motor neuron disease\". The four main types of MND are marked (*) in the table below.[16]\nAll types of MND can be differentiated by two defining characteristics:[6]\nSporadic or acquired MNDs occur in patients with no family history of degenerative motor neuron disease. Inherited or genetic MNDs adhere to one of the following inheritance patterns: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked. Some disorders, like ALS, can occur sporadically (85%) or can have a genetic cause (15%) with the same clinical symptoms and progression of disease.[6]\nUMNs are motor neurons that project from the cortex down to the brainstem or spinal cord.[17] LMNs originate in the anterior horns of the spinal cord and synapse on peripheral muscles.[17] Both motor neurons are necessary for the strong contraction of a muscle, but damage to an UMN can be distinguished from damage to a LMN by physical exam.[18]",
    "Treatment": "There are no known curative treatments for the majority of motor neuron disorders. \nPhysiotherapy helps maintain movement and function when someone is affected by\ndisability, injury or illness. This is achieved through movement and exercise, manual\ntherapy, education and advice. Although physiotherapy can't reverse the effects of\nMND, or Kennedy's disease, it can help maintain range of movement and comfort\nfor as long as possible.",

    "Disease": "Mucormycosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of mucormycosis depend on the location of the infection in the body.[6] Infection usually begins in the mouth or nose and enters the central nervous system via the eyes.[5]\nIf the fungal infection begins in the nose or sinus and extends to the brain, symptoms and signs may include one-sided eye pain or headache and may be accompanied by pain in the face, numbness, fever, loss of smell, a blocked nose or runny nose. The person may appear to have sinusitis.[25] The face may look swollen on one side, with rapidly progressing \"black lesions\" across the nose or upper inside of mouth. One eye may look swollen and bulging, and vision may be blurred.[6][25][26]\nFever, cough, chest pain, and difficulty breathing, or coughing up blood, can occur when the lungs are involved.[6] A stomach ache, nausea, vomiting, and bleeding can occur when the gastrointestinal tract is involved.[6][27] Affected skin may appear as a dusky reddish tender patch with a darkening centre due to tissue death.[13] There may be an ulcer, and it can be very painful.[5][7][13]\nInvasion of the blood vessels can result in thrombosis and subsequent death of surrounding tissue due to a loss of blood supply.[7] Widespread (disseminated) mucormycosis typically occurs in people who are already sick from other medical conditions, so it can be difficult to know which symptoms are related to mucormycosis. People with disseminated infection in the brain can develop changes in mental status or lapse into a coma.[28][29]",
    "Causes": "Mucormycosis is a fungal infection caused by fungi in the order Mucorales.[5] In most cases it is due to an invasion of the genera Rhizopus and Mucor, common bread molds.[30] Most fatal infections are caused by Rhizopus oryzae.[18] It is less likely due to Lichtheimia, and rarely due to Apophysomyces.[31] Others include Cunninghamella, Mortierella, and Saksenaea.[5][32]\nThe fungal spores are present in the environment. They can be found on items such as moldy bread and fruit, and are breathed in frequently, but cause disease only in some people.[5] In addition to being breathed in and deposited in the nose, sinuses, and lungs, the spores can also enter the skin via blood or directly through a cut or open wound, and can also grow in the intestine if eaten.[15][32] Once deposited, the fungus grows branch-like filaments which invade blood vessels, causing clots to form and surrounding tissues to die.[5] Other reported causes include contaminated wound dressings.[5] Mucormycosis has been reported following the use of elastoplast and the use of tongue depressors for holding in place intravenous catheters.[5] Outbreaks have also been linked to hospital bed sheets, negative-pressure rooms, water leaks, poor ventilation, contaminated medical equipment, and building works.[33] One hypothesis suggests that the spread of fungal spores in India could be due to fumes generated from the burning of Mucorales-rich biomass, like cow dung and crop stubble.[34]\nPredisposing factors for mucormycosis include immune deficiencies, a low neutrophil count, and metabolic acidosis.[13][9] Risk factors include poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (particularly DKA), organ transplant, iron overload, such cancers as lymphomas, kidney failure, liver disease, severe malnutrition, and long term corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy.[32][10] Other risk factors include tuberculosis (TB),[21] deferoxamine[1] and to a lesser extent HIV/AIDS.[1][7] Cases of mucormycosis in fit and healthy people are less common.[7]\nCorticosteroids are commonly used in the treatment of COVID-19 and reduce damage caused by the body's immune response to the virus. They suppress the immune system and increase blood sugar levels in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients. These effects may increase a person's vulnerability to developing a case of mucormycosis.[35][36][22]",
    "Diagnosis": "No blood test can confirm the diagnosis.[38] Diagnosis requires identifying the mold in the affected tissue by biopsy and confirming it with a fungal culture.[8] Because the causative fungi occur all around and may therefore contaminate cultures underway, a culture alone is not decisive.[5] Tests may also include culture and direct detection of the fungus in lung fluid, blood, serum, plasma, and urine.[21] Blood tests include a complete blood count to look specifically for neutropenia.[38] Other blood tests include iron levels, blood glucose, bicarbonate, and electrolytes.[38] Endoscopic examination of the nasal passages may be needed.[38]\nImaging is often performed, such as CT scan of lungs and sinuses.[39] Signs on chest CT scans, such as nodules, cavities, halo signs, pleural effusion and wedge-shaped shadows, showing invasion of blood vessels, may suggest a fungal infection, but do not confirm mucormycosis.[18] A reverse halo sign in a person with a blood cancer and low neutrophil count is highly suggestive of mucormycosis.[18] CT scan images of mucormycosis can be useful to distinguish mucormycosis of the orbit and cellulitis of the orbit, but images may appear identical to those of aspergillosis.[18] MRI may also be useful.[40] Currently,[when?] MRI with gadolinium contrast is the investigation of choice in rhinoorbito-cerebral mucormycosis.[citation needed]\nTo confirm the diagnosis, biopsy samples can be cultured.[14][38] Culture from biopsy samples does not always give a result as the organism is very fragile.[18] Microscopy can usually determine the genus and sometimes the species but may require an expert mycologist.[18] The appearance of the fungus under the microscope can vary but generally shows wide (10–20 micron), ribbon-like filaments that generally do not have septa and that—unlike in aspergillosis—branch at right angles, resembling antlers of a moose, which may be seen to be invading blood vessels.[13][38]\nMatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization may be used to identify the species.[38] A blood sample from an artery may be useful to assess for metabolic acidosis.[38]\nOther filamentous fungi may however look similar.[33] It may be difficult to differentiate from aspergillosis.[42] Other possible diagnoses include anthrax, cellulitis, bowel obstruction, ecthyma gangrenosum, lung cancer, clot in lungs, sinusitis, tuberculosis and fusariosis.[43]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment involves a combination of antifungal drugs, surgically removing infecting tissue, and correcting underlying medical problems, such as diabetic ketoacidosis.[1]\nOnce mucormycosis is suspected, amphotericin B at an initial dose of 1 mg is initially given slowly over 10–15 minutes into a vein, then given as a once daily dose according to body weight for the next 14 days.[44] It may need to be continued for longer.[42] Isavuconazole and Posaconazole are alternatives.[21][45]\nSurgery can be very drastic, and, in some cases of disease involving the nasal cavity and the brain, removal of infected brain tissue may be required. Removal of the palate, nasal cavity, or eye structures can be very disfiguring.[27] Sometimes more than one operation is required.[32]\nThe disease must be monitored carefully for any signs of re-emergence.[32][46] Treatment also requires correcting sugar levels and improving neutrophil counts.[1][7] Hyperbaric oxygen may be considered as an adjunctive therapy because higher oxygen pressure increases the ability of neutrophils to kill the fungus.[7] The efficacy of this therapy is uncertain.[33]",
    "Prognosis": "It tends to progress rapidly and is fatal in about half of sinus cases, two-thirds of lung cases, and almost all cases of the widespread type.[19] Skin involvement carries the lowest mortality rate of around 15%.[32] Possible complications of mucormycosis include the partial loss of neurological function, blindness, and clotting of blood vessels in the brain or lung.[27]\nAs treatment usually requires extensive and often disfiguring facial surgery, the effect on life after surviving, particularly sinus and brain involvement, is significant.[32]",
    "Epidemiology": "The true incidence and prevalence of mucormycosis may be higher than appears.[37] Mucormycosis is rare, affecting fewer than 1.7 people per million population each year in San Francisco.[8][47] It is around 80 times more prevalent in India, where it is estimated that there are around 0.14 cases per 1000 population,[20] and where its incidence has been rising.[48] Causative fungi are highly dependent on location. Apophysomyces variabilis has its highest prevalence in Asia and Lichtheimia spp. in Europe.[21] It is the third most common serious human fungal infection, after aspergillosis and candidiasis.[49]\nDiabetes is the main underlying disease in low and middle-income countries, whereas blood cancers and organ transplantation are the more common underlying problems in developed countries.[20] As new immunomodulating drugs and diagnostic tests are developed, the statistics for mucormycosis have been changing.[20] In addition, the figures change as new genera and species are identified, and new risk factors are reported, such as tuberculosis and kidney problems.[20]\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic in India, the Indian government reported that more than 11,700 people were receiving care for mucormycosis as of 25 May 2021. Many Indian media outlets called it \"black fungus\" because of the black discoloration of dead and dying tissue the fungus causes. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, rates of mucormycosis in India were estimated to be about 70 times higher than in the rest of the world.[3][50] Due to its rapidly growing number of cases some Indian state governments have declared it an epidemic.[51] One treatment was a daily injection for eight weeks of anti-fungal intravenous injection of amphotericin B which was in short supply. The injection could be standard amphotericin B deoxycholate or the liposomal form. The liposomal form cost more but it was considered \"safer, more effective and [with] lesser side effects\".[52] The major obstacle of using antifungal drugs in black fungus is the lack of clinical trials.[29]\nPre-COVID mucormycosis was a very rare infection, even in India. It is so rare that an ENT (ear, nose, throat) doctor would often not witness a case during their education. So, the documentation available on the treatment of mucormycosis is limited. There used to be a few mucormycosis expert ENT surgeons for millions of people before the pandemic. The sudden rise in mucormycosis cases has left a majority of ENT doctors with no option but to accept mucormycosis cases, as the expert doctors were very much occupied, and the patient would die if left untreated. The majority of the ENT doctors had to manage with minimal or no experience on mucormycosis, which has led to the recurrence of mucormycosis in the patients they treated. When a highly experienced doctor in mucormycosis treats a patient even if he cannot guarantee that the individual is completely cured and will not have a relapse of mucormycosis; an inexperienced ENT surgeon will have a high number of patients with recurrence due to which there were many recurrent cases of mucormycosis although it did not get the limelight of media or the Indian Government.",
    "Society and culture": "To confirm the diagnosis, biopsy samples can be cultured.[14][38] Culture from biopsy samples does not always give a result as the organism is very fragile.[18] Microscopy can usually determine the genus and sometimes the species but may require an expert mycologist.[18] The appearance of the fungus under the microscope can vary but generally shows wide (10–20 micron), ribbon-like filaments that generally do not have septa and that—unlike in aspergillosis—branch at right angles, resembling antlers of a moose, which may be seen to be invading blood vessels.[13][38]"

    "Disease": "Mulibrey nanism",
    "Signs and symptoms": "An individual with Mulibrey nanism has growth retardation, a short broad neck, misshapen sternum, small thorax, square shoulders, enlarged liver, and yellowish dots in the ocular fundi.[1][7][8] Individuals with Mulibrey nanism have also been reported to have intellectual disability, tumors, and infertility.[1]",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of Mulibrey nanism can be done via genetic testing,[3] as well as by the physical characteristics (signs/symptoms) displayed by the individual.[10]",
    "Treatment": "In terms of treatment/management for those with Mulibrey nanism should have routine medical follow-ups, additionally the following can be done:[4]",
    "Epidemiology": "Worldwide, it has been documented in 110 persons, 85 of them Finnish.  It is a recessive genetic disease. Many people with Mulibrey nanism have parents who are closely related, consanguine.  Signs and symptoms are variable: siblings who suffer this disease sometimes do not share the same symptoms.[1]"

    "Disease": "Multiple sulfatase deficiency",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of this disorder commonly appear between one and two years of age. Signs include mildly coarsened facial features, deafness, ichthyosis[7] and an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly).[8]  Abnormalities of the skeleton, such as a curving of the spine and breast bone may occur. Individuals afflicted with this disorder typically have dry skin.[9] Children affected by this disorder develop more slowly than normal and may display delayed speech and walking skills.[9]\nThe disease is fatal, with symptoms that include neurological damage and severe intellectual disability.[10] These sulfatase enzymes are responsible for breaking down and recycling complex sulfate-containing sugars from lipids and mucopolysaccharides within the lysosome. The accumulation of lipids and mucopolysaccharides inside the lysosome results in symptoms associated with this disorder. As of 2018[update], 75–100 cases of MSD had been reported worldwide.[9]",
    "Causes": "Multiple sulfatase deficiency is caused by any mutation of the SUMF1 gene which renders its protein product, the formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE), defective.[11][12] These mutations result in inactive forms of FGE.[13] This enzyme is required for posttranslational modification of a cysteine residue in the sulfatase enzyme active site into formylglycine,[14] which is required for its proper function.[15]",
    "Diagnosis": "MSD may be diagnosed when deficiency of more than one sulfatase enzyme is identified in leukocytes or fibroblasts,[16] or by molecular genetic testing which shows pathogenic variation in both alleles of the SUMF1 gene.[9]",
    "Treatment": "As there is no cure for MSD, treatment is restricted to the management of symptoms.[16]\nThere is much research on MSD that is currently underway. MSD Action Foundation has initiated more than 15 research projects on MSD in the last 6 years. Many of these have a translational focus. It is hoped that clinical trials for MSD will happen in the not-too-distant future- Alan Finglas. [Ref 17. Finglas 2020]"

    "Disease": "Multiple system atrophy",
    "Signs and symptoms": "MSA is characterized by the following: Autonomic and at least one Motor (clinically established MSA criteria 2022)[6][7]\nA variant with combined features of MSA and dementia with Lewy bodies may also exist.[unreliable medical source?][8] There have also been occasional instances of frontotemporal lobar degeneration associated with MSA.[9]\nThe most common first sign of MSA is the appearance of an \"akinetic-rigid syndrome\" (i.e. slowness of initiation of movement resembling Parkinson's disease) found in 62% at first presentation. Other common signs at onset include problems with balance (cerebellar ataxia) found in 22% at first presentation, followed by genito-urinary symptoms (9%): both men and women often experience urgency, frequency, incomplete bladder emptying, or an inability to pass urine (retention). About 1 in 5 MSA patients experience a fall in their first year of disease.[10]\nFor men, the first sign can be erectile dysfunction. Women have also reported reduced genital sensitivity.[11]\nAs the disease progresses, one of three groups of symptoms predominates.\nThese are:[12]",
    "Causes": "The most common causes of death are sudden death and death caused by infections, which include urinary catheterization infections, feeding tube infections, and aspiration pneumonia. Some deaths are caused by cachexia, also known as wasting syndrome.[79]",
    "Diagnosis": "Clinical diagnostic criteria were defined in 1998[40]  and updated in 2007[41] and in 2022.[42] Certain signs and symptoms of MSA also occur with other disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, making the diagnosis more difficult.[43][44][45]\nFeatures characteristic of OPCA include progressive cerebellar ataxia, leading to clumsiness in body movements, veering from midline when walking, wide-based stance, and falls without signs of paralysis or weakness.[46][47] Clinical presentation can vary greatly between patients, but mostly affects speech, balance and walking.[48]  Other possible neurological problems include spasmodic dysphonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, rigidity, dysarthria, dysphagia and neck dystonic posture.[47] Dysarthria is characterized by increased pauses of irregular duration, impaired coordination of vocal pitch, prolonged syllables and an overall irregular speech rhythm.[49] Diagnosis may be based on a thorough medical exam; the presence of signs and symptoms; imaging studies; various laboratory tests; and an evaluation of the family history.[50]\nBoth MRI and CT scanning may show a decrease in the size of the cerebellum and pons in those with cerebellar features (MSA-C). The putamen is hypointense on T2-weighted MRI and may show an increased deposition of iron in the Parkinsonian (MSA-P) form. In MSA-C, a \"hot cross bun\" sign is sometimes found; it reflects atrophy of the pontocerebellar tracts that give T2 hyper intense signal intensity in the atrophic pons.\nMRI changes are not required to diagnose the disease as these features are often absent, especially early in the course of the disease. Additionally, the changes can be quite subtle and  are usually missed by examiners who are not experienced with MSA.[citation needed]\nPathological diagnosis can only be made at autopsy by finding abundant glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) on histological specimens of the central nervous system.[51]\nOlivopontocerebellar atrophy can be used as a pathological term to describe degeneration of neurons in specific areas of the brain – the cerebellum, pons, and inferior olivary nucleus.[52] OPCA is present in several neurodegenerative syndromes, including inherited and non-inherited forms of ataxia (such as the hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia known as Machado–Joseph disease) and MSA, with which it is primarily associated.[52]\nContrary to most other synucleinopathies, which develop α-synuclein inclusions primarily in neuronal cell populations,[53] MSA presents with extensive pathological α-synuclein inclusions in the cytosol of oligodendrocytes (glial cytoplasmic inclusions), with limited pathology in neurons.[54] MSA also differs from other synucleinopathies in its regional pathological presentation, with α-synuclein positive inclusions detected predominantly in the striatum, midbrain, pons, medulla and cerebellum,[55][56] rather than the brainstem, limbic and cortical regions typically effected in Lewy inclusion diseases.[56] However, recent studies using novel, monoclonal antibodies specific for C-terminally truncated α-synuclein (αSynΔC) have now shown that neuronal α-synuclein pathology is more abundant than previously thought.[57][58] One group revealed robust α-synuclein pathology in the pontine nuclei and medullary inferior olivary nucleus upon histological analysis of neurological tissue from MSA patients.[57]\nHistopathological investigation on six cases of pathologically confirmed MSA, using antibodies directed at a variety of α-synuclein epitopes, revealed substantial variation in α-synuclein protein deposition across both cases and brain regions within cases, providing evidence for 'strains' of aggregated conformers that may differentially promote pathological prion-like spread.[59]\nIn 2020, researchers at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston concluded that protein misfolding cyclic amplification could be used to distinguish between two progressive neurodegenerative diseases, Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy, being the first process to give an objective diagnosis of Multiple System Atrophy instead of just a differential diagnosis.[60][61]\nMSA is one of several neurodegenerative diseases known as synucleinopathies: they have in common an abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein protein in various parts of the brain. Other synucleinopathies include Parkinson's disease, the Lewy body dementias, and other more rare conditions.[62]",
    "Treatment": "Ongoing care from a neurologist specializing in movement disorders is recommended,[by whom?] because the complex symptoms of MSA are often not familiar to less-specialized neurologists. Hospice/homecare services can be very useful as disability progresses.[citation needed]\nLevodopa (L-Dopa), a drug used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, improves parkinsonian symptoms in a small percentage of MSA patients. A recent trial reported that only 1.5% of MSA patients experienced any improvement at all when taking levodopa, their improvement was less than 50%, and even that improvement was a transient effect lasting less than one year. Poor response to L-Dopa has been suggested as a possible element in the differential diagnosis of MSA from Parkinson's disease.[73]\nThe drug riluzole is ineffective in treating MSA or PSP.[10]\nManagement by rehabilitation professionals including physiatrists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, and others for difficulties with walking/movement, daily tasks, and speech problems is essential.[citation needed]\nPhysiotherapists can help to maintain the patient's mobility and will help to prevent contractures.[74] Instructing patients in gait training will help to improve their mobility and decrease their risk of falls.[75] A physiotherapist may also prescribe mobility aids such as a cane or a walker to increase the patient's safety.[75]\nSpeech therapists may assist in assessing, treating and supporting speech (dysarthria) and swallowing difficulties (dysphagia).  Speech changes mean that alternative communication may be needed, for example, communication aids or word charts.[citation needed]\nEarly intervention of swallowing difficulties is particularly useful to allow for discussion around tube feeding further in the disease progression.[citation needed]  At some point in the progression of the disease, fluid and food modification may be implemented.[citation needed]\nOne particularly serious problem, the drop in blood pressure upon standing up (with risk of fainting and thus injury from falling), often responds to fludrocortisone, a synthetic mineralocorticoid.[76][77] Another common drug treatment is the alpha-agonist midodrine.[76]\nNon-drug treatments include \"head-up tilt\" (elevating the head of the whole bed by about 10 degrees), salt tablets or increasing salt in the diet, generous intake of fluids, and pressure (elastic) stockings. Avoidance of triggers of low blood pressure, such as hot weather, alcohol, and dehydration, are crucial.[77] The patient can be taught to move and transfer from sitting to standing slowly to decrease risk of falls and limit the effect of postural hypotension.[75] Instruction in ankle pumping helps to return blood in the legs to the systemic circulation.[75] Other preventative measures are raising the head of the bed by 8 in (20.3 cm), and the use of compression stockings and abdominal binders.[6]\nIn addition to orthostatic hypotension, supine hypertension, where the BP is excessively high lying down, is a frequent problem in multiple system atrophy. Treatment of one symptom can easily aggravate the other, and supine hypertension in such patients has been linked to the same cardiovascular complications as essential hypertension.[78]\nSocial workers and occupational therapists can also help with coping with disability through the provision of equipment and home adaptations, services for caregivers and access to healthcare services, both for the person with MSA as well as family caregivers.[citation needed]",
    "Prognosis": "The average lifespan after the onset of symptoms in patients with MSA is 6–10 years.[4] Approximately 60% of patients require a wheelchair within five years of onset of the motor symptoms, and few patients survive beyond 12 years.[4] The disease progresses without remission at a variable rate. Those who present at an older age, those with parkinsonian features, and those with severe autonomic dysfunction have a poorer prognosis.[4] Those with predominantly cerebellar features and those who display autonomic dysfunction later have a better prognosis.[4]\nThe most common causes of death are sudden death and death caused by infections, which include urinary catheterization infections, feeding tube infections, and aspiration pneumonia. Some deaths are caused by cachexia, also known as wasting syndrome.[79]",
    "Epidemiology": "Multiple system atrophy is estimated to affect approximately 5 per 100,000 people. At autopsy, many patients diagnosed during life with Parkinson's disease are found actually to have MSA, suggesting that the actual incidence of MSA is higher than that estimate.[4] While some suggest that MSA affects slightly more men than women (1.3:1), others suggest that the two sexes are equally likely to be affected.[4][6][74] The condition most commonly presents in persons aged 50–60.[4]"

    "Disease": "Myotonia congenita",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The prolonged muscle contractions, which occur most commonly in the leg muscles in recessive mutations, and more commonly in the hands, face, and eyelids in dominant mutations,[2] are often enhanced by inactivity, and in some forms are relieved by repetitive movement known as \"the warm-up effect\". This effect often diminishes quickly with rest. Some individuals with myotonia congenita are prone to falling as a result of hasty movements or an inability to stabilize themselves after a loss of balance. During a fall, a person with myotonia congenita may experience partial or complete rigid paralysis that will quickly resolve once the event is over. However, a fall into cold water may render the person unable to move for the duration of submergence. As with myotonic goats, children are more prone to falling than adults, due to their impulsivity.[citation needed]\nThe two major types of myotonia congenita are distinguished by the severity of their symptoms and their patterns of inheritance. Becker disease usually appears later in childhood than Thomsen disease, and causes more severe myotonia, muscle stiffness and transient weakness.[3] Although myotonia in itself is not normally associated with pain, cramps or myalgia may develop.[3] People with Becker disease often experience temporary attacks of muscle weakness, particularly in the arms and hands, brought on by movement after periods of rest. They may also develop mild, permanent muscle weakness over time.[4] This muscle weakness is not observed in people with Thomsen disease. However, in recent times, as more of the individual mutations that cause myotonia congenita are identified, these limited disease classifications are becoming less widely used.[citation needed]\nEarly symptoms in a child may include:[citation needed]\nPossible complications may include:[citation needed]\nBoth Thomsen and Becker myotonia have high phenotype variability. Severity of symptoms can vary greatly between individuals and throughout the lives of the individuals themselves. This may be partly because there are over 130 currently known different mutations that can cause the disorder, each with their own specifics, and also because myotonia congenita is an ion channel disorder, and ion channels are sensitive to internal and external environmental factors. It has been shown that pregnancy[6] and the use of diuretics[7] aggravate myotonia, and both these conditions are linked to the loss of divalent cations such as magnesium and calcium.[8] It has further been shown that in chemically-induced myotonia in isolated rat muscle, myotonia could be dampened by increasing the magnesium and calcium content of the extracellular medium.[9] This has also been shown for isolated human muscle.[10]\nAdrenaline/epinephrine is well known to make myotonia worse in most individuals with the disorder, and a person with myotonia congenita may experience a sudden increase in difficulty with mobility in a particularly stressful situation during which adrenaline is released.[citation needed]\nDue to the invisible nature of the disorder, the fact that those with myotonia congenita often appear very fit and able bodied, the general lack of knowledge about the disorder by the general and medical community, and often by the individual themselves, and the potential for inconsistency with the symptoms, many people with myotonia congenita have experienced a degree of social persecution at one time or another because of the effects of their disorder.[citation needed]\nThis phenomenon was described along with the disease by Thomsen in 1876 but its etiology remains unclear.[citation needed]\nPatients report that myotonia congenita may present itself in the following ways (this is from first hand experience). If the person is sedentary and then decides to walk up a set of stairs, by the third or fourth step their leg muscles begin to stiffen significantly, requiring them to slow down almost to a complete stop. But as the muscles loosen up, a few steps later, they can once again begin to climb the steps at a normal pace. If this person plays any kind of a sport, a good warm-up is mandatory. Otherwise if they need to quickly and intensively use their muscles, such as in a sprint race or a basketball game, their muscles will freeze up, causing them to slow down or almost come to a complete stop. But once the muscles are warmed up, they can once again function normally. This can happen in various muscles, even in muscles such as the tongue. For example, if a person has not spoken for awhile and then wants to speak, their tongue may be stiff at first causing the words to come out a little garbled, but after a few seconds of trying to speak, the tongue muscle will loosen up and then they can speak normally for the remainder of the time that they are conversing.[citation needed]\nPatients report that repeated contraction of muscle alleviates present myotonia with each contraction, such that myotonia is almost absent after a few contractions of the same muscle. The effect lasts about five minutes.[11] There have been several proposed mechanisms for this phenomenon, but none have been demonstrated conclusively; one hypothesis is that the Na+/K+-ATPase is stimulated during the myotonic activity by increased intracellular Na+ in the cytosol of the muscle cell, increasing the activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase. However, in experiments with patients where the Na+/K+-ATPase had been blocked in the underarm by infusion of the Na+/K+-ATPase-blocker Ouabain, no effect on warm-up was observed.[12] Another hypothesis states that the few remaining functional chloride channels in muscle may become more active with increased muscle activity.[13]\nIt has been proposed that inactivation of sodium channel protein type 4 subunit alpha, residing in skeletal muscle, could play an important role in the warm-up phenomenon. In particular, slow inactivation of the channel is believed to have a spatial and temporal extent that is correlated to warm-up and therefore may provide a plausible cause.[14]",
    "Causes": "The disorder is caused by mutations in part of a gene (CLCN1) encoding the ClC-1 chloride channel, resulting in muscle fiber membranes having an unusually exaggerated response to stimulation (hyperexcitability).[citation needed]\nThree cases have been reported who were diagnosed with Thomsen's myotonia and proved on genetic testing not to have mutations in the chloride gene but rather in the alpha-subunit of the voltage gated sodium channel (SCN4A).[15] Like chloride channel mutations, patients with sodium channel mutations may have a very varied phenotype, making a diagnosis more difficult.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "Two types of myotonia congenita exist, an autosomal dominant form and an autosomal recessive form. Autosomal dominant myotonia congenita (OMIM #160800) is also called Thomsen disease, after Danish/German physician Asmus Julius Thomas Thomsen (1815–1896), who himself had the disease and who wrote the first description of it in the medical literature (in 1876).[18] Autosomal recessive myotonia congenita (OMIM #255700) is also called generalized myotonia, recessive generalized myotonia (RGM), Becker disease, and Becker myotonia, after the German professor Peter Emil Becker, who discovered its recessive nature.[19]\nThe term congenital in its sense of \"clinically apparent from birth\" applies only to Thomsen disease, as the clinical onset of Becker myotonia may be delayed up to the age of 4 to 6 years.[2] But in either form of myotonia congenita, the term's strictest sense reflects that the disease is genetically present from birth, although the clinical onset may be delayed.[citation needed]\nWith the advent of genetic testing, it has recently been found that some typically recessive mutations may occur in a dominant fashion in some individuals. The reason for this is not known.[citation needed]\nBecause several CLCN1 mutations can cause either Becker disease or Thomsen disease, doctors usually rely on characteristic signs and symptoms to distinguish the two forms of myotonia congenita. However, myotonia caused by CLCN1 mutations can occasionally be clinically indistinguishable from myotonia caused by sodium channel mutations (SCN4A mutations) resulting in the similar disease paramyotonia congenita.[citation needed]\nA so-called Finnish heritage disease, congenital myotonia is more common in Finland and among ethnic Finns.  A molecular study of the CLCN1 gene in 24 families in northern Finland, including 46 affected individuals, showed that although the inheritance appeared to be dominant (Thomsen type), in fact it is recessive (Becker type).[20]\nSodium channel myotonias (SCN4A)\nDystrophies\nPotassium channel disorders (KCNJ2)\nOther disorders",
    "Treatment": "Some cases of myotonia congenita do not require treatment, or it is determined that the risks of the medication outweigh the benefits. If necessary, however, symptoms of the disorder may be relieved with quinine, ranolazine, procainamide, flecainide, phenytoin, carbamazepine, mexiletine and other anticonvulsant drugs. Physical therapy and other rehabilitative measures may also be used to help muscle function. Genetic counseling is available.[citation needed]",
    "Epidemiology": "In northern Scandinavia, the prevalence of myotonia congenita has been estimated at 1:10,000.[20]\nMyotonia congenita is estimated to affect 1 in 100,000 people worldwide.[21]"

    "Disease": "Nakajo syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Signs of the disease begin during early childhood with individuals developing red, swollen lumps (nodular erythema) on the skin especially during colder weather, frequent fevers, and elongated fingers and toes with widened and rounded tips (clubbing).[4]\nLater in childhood, individuals with the disease develop join pain, and joint deformities (contractures) that limit movement predominantly in the hands, wrists, and elbows. They additional have weakness and wasting of muscle and fat loss that worsens over time. This leads to an extremely thin (emaciated) appearance in the face, chest, and arms.[4]\nOther symptoms of Nakajo-Nishimura syndrome are enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), shortage of red blood cells (anemia), reduced levels of platelet blood cells (thrombocytopenia), and calcification in the basal ganglia area of the brain. There have been cases of intellectual disability in affected individuals.[4]\nNakajo-Nishimura syndrome has overlapping symptoms with joint contractures, muscular atrophy, microcytic anemia, and panniculitis-induced lipodystrophy (JMP) syndrome and chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperature (CANDLE) syndrome. These conditions are all caused by mutations in PSMB8 and characterized by skin abnormalities and lipodystrophy. Although these conditions are considered different diseases, some researchers believe they represent different forms of a single condition.[4]",
    "Diagnosis": "Typical diagnosis looks for at least five out of eight proposed criteria for Nakajo syndrome: an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, pernio-like purplish lesions (on hands and feet), ''haunting'' nodular erythema, repetitive spiking fever, long clubbed fingers and toes with joint contractures, progressive upper body lipomuscular atrophy/emaciation, hepatosplenomegaly and basal ganglion calcification on computed tomography (CT) scans. These features are not always apparent until childhood. Histopathologic examination shows focal mononuclear cell infiltration with vasculopathy. Laboratory results include continually elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and hyper-gamma-globulinemia. Autoantibody titers rise as the disease progresses in some but remain negative in others. Molecular genetic testing can detect a disease causing mutation, verifying diagnosis.[7]",
    "Treatment": "Currently, there are no treatments for Nakajo syndrome. However, available treatment options may help alleviate some of the symptoms. Existing steroids may help reduce inflammatory responses. Various immunosuppressive and anti-rheumatic have shown to have little or no temporal response in PRAAS patients. Ultimately, the progressive lipodystrophy caused by Nakajo syndrome continues despite treatment.[8]",

  {
    "Disease": "Narcolepsy",
    "Signs and symptoms": "There are two main characteristics of narcolepsy: excessive daytime sleepiness and abnormal REM sleep.[15] Excessive daytime sleepiness occurs even after adequate night time sleep. A person with narcolepsy is likely to become drowsy or fall asleep, often at inappropriate or undesired times and places, or just be very tired throughout the day. Narcoleptics may not be able to experience the amount of restorative deep sleep that healthy people experience due to abnormal REM regulation – they are not \"oversleeping.\" Narcoleptics typically have higher REM sleep density than non-narcoleptics, but also experience more REM sleep without atonia.[16] Many narcoleptics have sufficient REM sleep, but do not feel refreshed or alert throughout the day.[17] This can feel like living their entire lives in a constant state of sleep deprivation.[medical citation needed]\nExcessive sleepiness can vary in severity and appears most commonly during monotonous situations that require little interaction.[17] Daytime naps may occur with little warning and may be physically irresistible. These naps can occur several times a day. They are typically refreshing, but only for a brief period. Vivid dreams may be experienced regularly, even during short naps. Drowsiness may persist for prolonged periods or remain constant. Additionally, nighttime sleep may be fragmented, with frequent awakenings. A second prominent symptom of narcolepsy is abnormal REM sleep. Narcoleptics are unique in that instead of following the typical sleep cycle, they enter into the REM phase of sleep at the beginning of sleep, even when sleeping during the day.[15]\nThe classic symptoms of the disorder, often referred to as the \"tetrad of narcolepsy\", are cataplexy, sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations, and excessive daytime sleepiness.[18] Other symptoms may include automatic behaviors and night-time wakefulness.[15][19][20] These symptoms may not occur in all people with narcolepsy.\nIn most cases, the first symptom of narcolepsy to appear is excessive and overwhelming daytime sleepiness. The other symptoms may begin alone or in combination months or years after the onset of the daytime naps. There are wide variations in the development, severity, and order of appearance of cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations in individuals. Only about 20 to 25 percent of people with narcolepsy experience all four symptoms. The excessive daytime sleepiness generally persists throughout life, but sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations may not.\nMany people with narcolepsy also have insomnia for extended periods. The excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy often become severe enough to cause serious problems in a person's social, personal, and professional life. Normally, when an individual is awake, brain waves show a regular rhythm. When a person first falls asleep, the brain waves become slower and less regular, which is called non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. After about an hour and a half of NREM sleep, the brain waves begin to show a more active pattern again, called REM sleep (rapid eye movement sleep), when most remembered dreaming occurs. Associated with the EEG-observed waves during REM sleep, muscle atonia is present, called REM atonia.[medical citation needed]\nIn narcolepsy, the order and length of NREM and REM sleep periods are disturbed, with REM sleep occurring at sleep onset instead of after a period of NREM sleep. Also, some aspects of REM sleep that normally occur only during sleep, like lack of muscular control, sleep paralysis, and vivid dreams, occur at other times in people with narcolepsy. For example, the lack of muscular control can occur during wakefulness in a cataplexy episode; it is said that there is an intrusion of REM atonia during wakefulness. Sleep paralysis and vivid dreams can occur while falling asleep or waking up. Simply put, the brain does not pass through the normal stages of dozing and deep sleep but goes directly into (and out of) rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.[medical citation needed]\nAs a consequence, nighttime sleep does not include as much deep sleep, so the brain tries to \"catch up\" during the day, hence excessive daytime sleepiness. People with narcolepsy may visibly fall asleep at unpredictable moments (such motions as head bobbing are common). People with narcolepsy fall quickly into what appears to be very deep sleep, and they wake up suddenly and can be disoriented when they do (dizziness is a common occurrence). They have very vivid dreams, which they often remember in great detail. People with narcolepsy may dream even when they only fall asleep for a few seconds. Along with vivid dreaming, people with narcolepsy are known to have audio or visual hallucinations before falling asleep or before waking up.[23]\nNarcoleptics can gain excess weight; children can gain 20 to 40 pounds (9.1 to 18.1 kg) when they first develop narcolepsy; in adults, the body-mass index is about 15% above average.[24][25]",
    "Causes": "The exact cause of narcolepsy is unknown, and it may be caused by several distinct factors.[1][7] The mechanism involves the loss of orexin-releasing neurons within the lateral hypothalamus (about 70,000 neurons[26]).[27][28]\nSome researches indicated that people with type 1 narcolepsy (narcolepsy with cataplexy) have a lower level of orexin (hypocretin), which is a chemical contributing to the regulation of wakefulness and REM sleep.[29] It also acts as a neurotransmitter to enable nerve cells to communicate.[14]\nIn up to 10% of cases, there is a family history of the disorder. Family history is more common in narcolepsy with cataplexy.[1] There is a strong link with certain genetic variants,[27] which may make T-cells susceptible to react to the orexin-releasing neurons (autoimmunity)[30] after being stimulated by infection with H1N1 influenza.[12] In addition to genetic factors, low levels of orexin peptides have been correlated with a history of infection, diet, contact with toxins such as pesticides, and brain injuries due to head trauma, brain tumors or strokes.[15][27]\nThe primary genetic factor that has been strongly implicated in the development of narcolepsy involves an area of chromosome 6 known as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex.[27][31] Specific variations in HLA genes are strongly correlated with the presence of narcolepsy (HLA DQB1*06:02, frequently in combination with HLA DRB1*15:01);[27] however, these variations are not required for the condition to occur and sometimes occur in individuals without narcolepsy.[27][32] These genetic variations in the HLA complex are thought to increase the risk of an auto-immune response to orexin-releasing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus.[27][28][32]\nThe allele HLA-DQB1*06:02 of the human gene HLA-DQB1 was reported in more than 90% of people with narcolepsy, and alleles of other HLA genes, such as HLA-DQA1*01:02, have been linked. A 2009 study found a strong association with polymorphisms in the TRAC gene locus (dbSNP IDs rs1154155, rs12587781, and rs1263646).[26] A 2013 review article reported additional but weaker links to the loci of the genes TNFSF4 (rs7553711), Cathepsin H (rs34593439), and P2RY11-DNMT1 (rs2305795).[33] Another gene locus that has been associated with narcolepsy is EIF3G (rs3826784).[34]\nType 1 narcolepsy is caused by hypocretin/orexin neuronal loss. T-cells have been demonstrated to be cross-reactive to both a particular piece of the hemagglutinin flu protein of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 and the amidated terminal ends of the secreted hypocretin peptides.[12]\nGenes associated with narcolepsy mark the particular HLA heterodimer (DQ0602) involved in presentation of these antigens and modulate expression of the specific T cell receptor segments (TRAJ24 and TRBV4-2) involved in T cell receptor recognition of these antigens, suggesting causality.[12]\nA link between GlaxoSmithKline's H1N1 flu vaccine Pandemrix and narcolepsy has been found in both children and adults.[35] In 2010, Finland's National Institute of Health and Welfare recommended that Pandemrix vaccinations be suspended pending further investigation into narcolepsy.[36][37] In 2018, it was demonstrated that T-cells stimulated by Pandemrix were cross-reactive by molecular mimicry with part of the hypocretin peptide, the loss of which is associated with type I narcolepsy.[12]",
    "Diagnosis": "The third edition of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3) differentiates between narcolepsy with cataplexy (type 1) and narcolepsy without cataplexy (type 2), while the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) uses the diagnosis of narcolepsy to refer to type 1 narcolepsy only. The DSM-5 refers to narcolepsy without cataplexy as hypersomnolence disorder.[42] The most recent edition of the International Classification of Diseases, ICD-11, currently identifies three types of narcolepsy: type 1 narcolepsy, type 2 narcolepsy, and unspecified narcolepsy.[43]\nICSD-3 diagnostic criteria posit that the individual must experience \"daily periods of irrepressible need to sleep or daytime lapses into sleep\" for both subtypes of narcolepsy.[42] This symptom must last for at least three months. For a diagnosis of type 1 narcolepsy, the person must present with either cataplexy, a mean sleep latency of less than 8 minutes, and two or more sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMPs), or they must present with a hypocretin-1 concentration of less than 110 pg/mL.[42] A diagnosis of type 2 narcolepsy requires a mean sleep latency of less than 8 minutes, two or more SOREMPs, and a hypocretin-1 concentration of more than 110 pg/mL. In addition, the hypersomnolence and sleep latency findings cannot be better explained by other causes.[42]\nDSM-5 narcolepsy criteria requires that the person to display recurrent periods of \"an irrepressible need to sleep, lapsing into sleep, or napping\" for at least three times a week over three months.[42] The individual must also display one of the following: cataplexy, hypocretin-1 concentration of less than 110 pg/mL, REM sleep latency of less than 15 minutes, or a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) showing sleep latency of less than 8 minutes and two or more SOREMPs.[42] For a diagnosis of hypersomnolence disorder, the individual must present with excessive sleepiness despite at least 7 hours of sleep as well as either recurrent lapses into daytime sleep, nonrestorative sleep episodes of 9 or more hours, or difficulty staying awake after awakening. In addition, the hypersomnolence must occur at least three times a week for three months, and must be accompanied by significant distress or impairment. It also cannot be explained by another sleep disorder, coexisting mental or medical disorders, or medication.[44]\nDiagnosis is relatively easy when all the symptoms of narcolepsy are present, but if the sleep attacks are isolated and cataplexy is mild or absent, diagnosis is more difficult. Three tests that are commonly used in diagnosing narcolepsy are polysomnography (PSG), the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). These tests are usually performed by a sleep specialist.[45]\nPolysomnography involves the continuous recording of sleep brain waves and a number of nerve and muscle functions during nighttime sleep. When tested, people with narcolepsy fall asleep rapidly, enter REM sleep early, and may often awaken during the night. The polysomnogram also helps to detect other possible sleep disorders that could cause daytime sleepiness.[citation needed]\nThe Epworth Sleepiness Scale is a brief questionnaire that is administered to determine the likelihood of the presence of a sleep disorder, including narcolepsy.[46]\nThe multiple sleep latency test is performed after the person undergoes an overnight sleep study. The person will be asked to sleep once every 2 hours, and the time it takes for them to do so is recorded. Most individuals will fall asleep within 5 to 8 minutes, as well as display REM sleep faster than non-narcoleptic people.[citation needed]\nMeasuring orexin levels in a person's cerebrospinal fluid sampled in a spinal tap may help in diagnosing narcolepsy, with abnormally low levels serving as an indicator of the disorder.[47] This test can be useful when MSLT results are inconclusive or difficult to interpret.[48]",
    "Treatment": "People with narcolepsy can be substantially helped, but not cured, currently. However, the technology exists in early form such as experiments in using the prepro-orexin transgene via gene editing restored normal function in mice models by making other neurons produce orexin after the original set have been destroyed, or replacing the missing orexinergic neurons with hypocretin stem cell transplantation, are both steps in that direction for fixing the biology effectively permanently once applied in humans.[49][50] Additionally effective ideal non-gene editing and chemical-drug methods involve hypocretin treatments methods such as future drugs like hypocretin agonists (such as danavorexton)[51] or hypocretin replacement, in the form of hypocretin 1 given intravenous (injected into the veins), intracisternal (direct injection into the brain), and intranasal (sprayed through the nose), the latter being low in efficacy, at the low amount used in current experiments but may be effective at very high doses in the future.[52][53]\nGeneral strategies like people and family education, sleep hygiene, medication adherence, and discussion of safety issues, for example driving license, can be useful. Potential side effects of medication can also be addressed.[17] Regular follow-up is useful to be able to monitor the response to treatment, to assess the presence of other sleep disorders like obstructive sleep apnea, and to discuss psychosocial issues.[17]\nIn many cases, planned regular short naps can reduce the need for pharmacological treatment of the EDS, but only improve symptoms for a short duration. A 120-minute nap provided benefit for 3 hours in the person's alertness whereas a 15-minute nap provided no benefit.[54] Daytime naps are not a replacement for night time sleep. Ongoing communication between the health care provider, the person, and their family members is important for optimal management of narcolepsy.\nAs described above, medications used to treat narcolepsy primarily target EDS and/or cataplexy. Internationally, there are differences in the availability of medications as well as guidelines for treatment. The alerting agents are medications typically used to improve wakefulness and include modafinil, armodafinil, pitolisant, and solriamfetol. In late 2007, an alert for severe adverse skin reactions to modafinil was issued by the FDA.[55] Solriamfetol is a new molecule indicated for narcolepsy of type 1 and 2.[56] Solriamfetol works by inhibiting the reuptake of the monoamines via the interaction with both the dopamine transporter and the norepinephrine transporter. This mechanism differs from that of the wake-promoting agents modafinil and armodafinil. These are thought to bind primarily at the dopamine transporter to inhibit the reuptake of dopamine. Solriamfetol also differs from amphetamines as it does not promote the release of norepinephrine in the brain.[57] Uniquely, Pitolisant has a novel mechanism of action as an H3 antagonists, which promotes the release of the wakefulness-promoting molecule amine histamine. It was initially available in France, United Kingdom's (NHS as of September 2016[update][58][59][60][61]) after being given marketing authorisation by European Commission on the advice of the European Medicines Agency and then in the United States by the approval of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as of August 2019[update].[62] Pemoline was previously used but was withdrawn due to toxicity.[63]\nTraditional stimulants, such as methylphenidate, amphetamine, and dextroamphetamine can be used, but are commonly considered second- or third-line therapy.\nSodium oxybate,[64] also known as sodium gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), can be used for cataplexy associated with narcolepsy and excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy.[64][65][17][66] There are now three formulations of oxybate medications (twice-nightly sodium oxybate, twice nightly mixed salts oxybate, and once-nightly extended-release sodium oxybate). This class of medication is taken once or twice during the night, as opposed to other medications for EDS and cataplexy that are typically taken during the day.\nOther medications that suppress REM sleep [67] may also be used for the treatment of cataplexy as well as potentially other REM dissociative symptoms. Tricyclic antidepressants (clomipramine, imipramine, or protriptyline), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (Venlafaxine) are used for the treatment of cataplexy.[1] Atomoxetine, a non-stimulant and a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI), which has no addiction liability or recreational effects, has been used with variable benefit.[63] Other NRIs like viloxazine and reboxetine have also been used in the treatment of narcolepsy.[63] Additional related medications include mazindol and selegiline.[63]",
    "Epidemiology": "Estimates of frequency range from 0.2 per 100,000 in Israel to 600 per 100,000 in Japan.[2] These differences may be due to how the studies were conducted or the populations themselves.[2]\nIn the United States, narcolepsy is estimated to affect as many as 200,000 Americans, but fewer than 50,000 are diagnosed. The prevalence of narcolepsy is about 1 per 2,000 persons.[71] Narcolepsy is often mistaken for depression, epilepsy, the side effects of medications, poor sleeping habits or recreational drug use, making misdiagnosis likely.[citation needed] While narcolepsy symptoms are often confused with depression, there is a link between the two disorders. Research studies have mixed results on co-occurrence of depression in people with narcolepsy, as the numbers quoted by different studies are anywhere between 6% and 50%.[72]\nNarcolepsy can occur in both men and women at any age, although typical symptom onset occurs in adolescence and young adulthood. There is about a ten-year delay in diagnosing narcolepsy in adults.[25] Cognitive, educational, occupational, and psychosocial problems associated with the excessive daytime sleepiness of narcolepsy have been documented. For these to occur in the crucial teen years, when education, development of self-image, and development of occupational choice are taking place, is especially devastating. While cognitive impairment does occur, it may only be a reflection of the excessive daytime somnolence.[73]"

    "Disease": "Necrolytic migratory erythema",
    "Signs and symptoms": "NME features a characteristic skin eruption of red patches with irregular borders, intact and ruptured vesicles, and crust formation.[1] It commonly affects the limbs and skin surrounding the lips, although less commonly the abdomen, perineum, thighs, buttocks, and groin may be affected.[1] Frequently these areas may be left dry or fissured as a result.[1] All stages of lesion development may be observed synchronously.[2] The initial eruption may be exacerbated by pressure or trauma to the affected areas.[1]\nWilliam Becker first described an association between NME and glucagonoma in 1942[2][3] and since then, NME has been described in as many as 70% of persons with a glucagonoma.[4] NME is considered part of the glucagonoma syndrome,[5] which is associated with hyperglucagonemia, diabetes mellitus, and hypoaminoacidemia.[2]\nWhen NME is identified in the absence of a glucagonoma, it may be considered \"pseudoglucagonoma syndrome\".[6] Less common than NME with glucagonoma, pseudoglucagonoma syndrome may occur in a number of systemic disorders:[7]",
    "Causes": "The cause of NME is unknown, although various mechanisms have been suggested. These include hyperglucagonemia, zinc deficiency, fatty acid deficiency, hypoaminoacidemia, and liver disease.[2]",
    "Diagnosis": "The histopathologic features of NME are nonspecific[8] and include:[9]\nThe vacuolated, pale, swollen epidermal cells and necrosis of the superficial epidermis are most characteristic.[2] Immunofluorescence is usually negative.[2]",
    "Treatment": "Managing the original condition, glucagonoma, by octreotide or surgery. After resection, the rash typically resolves within days.[10]"

    "Disease": "Necrotizing fasciitis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Symptoms emerge very quickly, often within hours.[7] Manifestations include:\nThe initial skin changes are similar to cellulitis or abscess, so diagnosis in early stages may be difficult. The redness and swelling usually blend into surrounding normal tissues. The overlying skin may appear shiny and tense as well.[8]\nLater signs more suggestive of necrotizing changes (but only present in less than half of cases) are:\nRapid progression to shock despite antibiotic therapy is another indication of necrotizing fasciitis. However, those who are immunocompromised may not show typical symptoms. This includes but is not limited to patients with:\nImmunocompromised persons are twice as likely to die from necrotizing infections compared to the greater population, so higher suspicion should be maintained in this group.[2]",
    "Causes": "Vulnerable populations are typically older with medical comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, and immunodeficiency.[4]  Other documented risk factors include:\nFor reasons that are unclear, it can also infect healthy individuals with no previous medical history or injury.[7][9]\nNSAIDs may increase the rates of necrotizing infections by impairing the body's immune response. NSAIDs inhibit the production of prostaglandins responsible for fever, inflammation, and pain. In theory, it also prevents white blood cells from migrating to infected areas, thus increasing the risk of soft-tissue infections.[2][7]\nSkin infections such as abscesses and ulcers can also complicate NF. A small percentage of people can also get NF when bacteria from streptococcal pharyngitis spreads through the blood.[10] For infection of the perineum and genitals (Fournier gangrene), urinary tract infection, renal stones, and Bartholin gland abscess may also be implicated.[2]\nGood wound care and handwashing reduces the risk of developing necrotizing fasciitis.[3] It is unclear if people with a weakened immune system would benefit from taking antibiotics after being exposed to a necrotizing infection.  Generally, such a regimen entails 250 mg penicillin four times daily for 10 days.[7]\nNecrotizing fasciitis is divided into four classes by the type of bacteria causing the infection. This classification system was first described by Giuliano and his colleagues in 1977.[4][2]\nType I infection: This is the most common type of infection, and accounts for 70 to 80% of cases. It is caused by a mixture of bacterial types, usually in abdominal or groin areas.[4] These bacterial species include:\nIn polymicrobial (mixed) infections, Group A Streptococcus (S. pyogenes) is the most commonly found bacterium, followed by S. aureus.[10] However, when the infection is caused solely by S. pyogenes and/or S. aureus, it is classified as a Type II infection.\nGram-negative bacteria and anaerobes like Clostridia are more often implicated in Fournier gangrene. This is a subtype of Type I infections affecting the groin and perianal areas.[10] Clostridia account for 10% of overall type I infections and typically cause a specific kind of necrotizing fasciitis known as gas gangrene or myonecrosis.\nType II infection: This infection accounts for 20 to 30% of cases, mainly involving the extremities.[4][11] This involves Streptococcus pyogenes, alone or in combination with staphylococcal infections. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is involved in up to a third of Type II infections.[4] Infection by either type of bacteria can progress rapidly and manifest as shock. Type II infection more commonly affects young, healthy adults with a history of injury.[2]\nType III infection: Vibrio vulnificus is a bacterium found in saltwater. It occasionally causes NF after entering the body through a break in the skin.[12] One in three patients with a V. vulnificus infection develop necrotizing fasciitis.[12] Disease progression is similar to type II but sometimes with few visible skin changes.[2]\nType IV infection: This type of NF accounts for less than 1% of cases. It is mostly caused by the Candida albicans fungus. Risk factors include age and immunodeficiency.[4][13]",
    "Diagnosis": "Early diagnosis is difficult, as the disease often first appears like a simple superficial skin infection.[4] While a number of labs and imaging can raise the suspicion for necrotizing fasciitis, none can rule it out.[14] The gold standard for diagnosis is a surgical exploration and subsequent tissue biopsy. When in doubt, a 2-cm incision can be made into the affected tissue under local anesthesia.[2][15]  If a finger easily separates the tissue along the fascia, then the finger test is positive. This confirms the diagnosis, and an extensive debridement should be performed.[2][15]\nNecrotizing fasciitis is ideally a clinical diagnosis based on symptoms. Due to the need for rapid surgical treatment, the time delay in performing imaging is a major concern.[15]  Hence, imaging may not be needed if signs of a necrotizing infection are clear.  However, due to the vague symptoms associated with the earlier stages of this disease, imaging is often useful in clarifying or confirming the diagnosis.[15]\nBoth CT scan and MRI are used to diagnose NF, but neither are sensitive enough to rule out necrotizing changes completely.[2]\nIf available, computed tomography (CT) is the most convenient tool in diagnosing NF due to its speed and resolution (detects about 80% of NF cases).[16] CT scan may show fascial thickening, edema, or abscess formation.[2][15] CT is able to pick up on gas within tissues better than MRI, but it is not unusual for NF to present without gas on imaging.[15] In addition, CT is helpful in evaluating complications due to NF and finding possible sources of infections.[15] Its use may be limited in pregnant patients and patients with kidney issues.[15]\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered superior to computed tomography (CT) in the visualization of soft tissues and is able to detect about 93% of NF cases.[15] It is especially useful in finding fluid in the deep fascia, which can distinguish between NF and cellulitis.[15]  When fluid collects in the deep fascia, or thickening or enhancement with contrast, necrotizing fasciitis should be strongly suspected. However, MRI is much slower than CT and not as widely available.[15]  There may also be limitations on its use in patients with kidney problems.[15]\nPoint-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) may be useful in the diagnosis of NF if MRI and CT are not available.[18] It can also help rule out diagnoses that mimic earlier stages of NF, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), superficial abscesses, and venous stasis.[18] Linear probes are generally preferred for the assessment, especially in the extremities.[18]\nFindings characteristic of NF include abnormal thickening, air, or fluid in the subcutaneous tissue.[18] This can be summarized as the mnemonic \"STAFF\" (Subcutaneous irregularity or Thickening, Air, and Fascial Fluid).[18] The official diagnosis of NF using ultrasound requires \"the presence of BOTH diffuse subcutaneous thickening AND fascial fluid more than 2 mm.\"[18] Gas in the subcutaneous tissue may show \"dirty acoustic shadowing.\"[15] However, similar to other imaging modalities, the absence of subcutaneous free air does not definitively rule out a diagnosis of NF, because this is a finding that often emerges later in the disease process.[18]\nOf note, the quality and accuracy of POCUS is highly user-dependent.  It may also be difficult to visualize NF over larger areas, or if there are many intervening layers of fat or muscle.  It is still unclear whether POCUS improves the speed of diagnosis of NF, or if it reduces the time to surgical intervention as a whole.[18]\nIt is difficult to distinguish NF from cellulitis in earlier stages of the disease using plain radiography.[15] X-rays can detect subcutaneous emphysema (gas in the subcutaneous tissue), which is strongly suggestive of necrotizing changes. However, air is often a late-stage finding, and not all necrotizing skin infections create subcutaneous emphysema. Hence, radiography is not recommended for the initial diagnosis of NF.[15] However, it may be able to identify the source of infection, such as foreign bodies or fractures, and thus aid in subsequent treatment.[15]\nCorrelated with clinical findings, a white blood cell count greater than 15,000 cells/mm3 and serum sodium level less than 135 mmol/L are predictive of necrotizing fasciitis in 90% of cases.[3] If lab values do not meet those values, there is a 99% chance that the patient does not have NF.  There are various scoring systems to determine the likelihood of getting necrotizing fasciitis. The laboratory risk indicator for necrotizing fasciitis (LRINEC) scoring system developed by Wong and their colleagues in 2004 is the most common. It evaluates people with severe cellulitis or abscess to determine the likelihood of necrotizing fasciitis.\nLRINEC uses six laboratory values: C-reactive protein, total white blood cell count, hemoglobin, sodium, creatinine, and blood glucose.[2] A score of 6 or more indicates that there is a 50-75% probability of necrotizing fasciitis. A score of 8 or more represents over 75% likelihood of NF.[15][19][20] Patients with a LRINEC score ≥6 may have a higher rate of both death and amputation as well.[21] The scoring criteria are:[19][22]\nHowever, this scoring system is yet to be validated.[3] A LRINEC score ≥6 is only able to detect 70% of NF cases, and a LRINEC score ≥8 has shown even poorer sensitivity.[20]  Moreover, these lab values may be falsely positive if any other inflammatory conditions are present. Therefore, this scoring system should be interpreted with caution.[2]",
    "Treatment": "Necrotizing fasciitis is treated with surgical debridement (cutting away affected tissue).[3] However, antibiotics should be started as soon as this condition is suspected. Appropriate antibiotic coverage may be changed based on tissue cultures. Additional support should be initiated for those with unstable vital signs and low urine output.[2]\nAggressive wound debridement should be performed as soon as the diagnosis is made. The affected area may need to be debrided several times, usually once every 12–36 hours.[3] Large sections of tissue and muscle may need to be removed to prevent the infection from spreading. Amputation may be needed if the infection is too severe.[3]\nEn bloc debridement (EBd) is most commonly employed in treating NSTIs.[23]  This involves cutting away the skin overlying all diseased areas at the cost of increased scar formation and potential decreased quality of life post-operatively.[23]  More recently, skin-sparing debridement (SSd) has gained traction, as it resects the underlying tissue and sources of infection while preserving skin that is not overtly necrotic.[23]  However, more studies are needed to examine whether SSd actually accelerates the healing process after surgery.[23]\nAfter the wound debridement, adequate dressings should be applied to promote wound healing.[2] Wounds are generally packed with wet-to-dry dressings and left open to heal.[3] In certain cases, vacuum-sealing drainage (VSD) may help the wound heal, especially in Fournier gangrene.\nFor necrotizing infection of the perineal area (Fournier's gangrene), wound debridement and wound care in this area can be difficult because of the excretory products that often render this area dirty and affect the wound-healing process. Therefore, regular dressing changes with a fecal management system can help to keep the wound at the perineal area clean. Sometimes, colostomy may be necessary to divert the excretory products to keep the wound at the perineal area clean.[2]\nEmpiric antibiotics are usually initiated as soon as the diagnosis of NSTI has been made. They are then changed to culture-guided antibiotic therapy. In the case of NSTIs, empiric antibiotics are broad-spectrum, covering gram-positive (including MRSA), gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria.[24] Often, a combination of clindamycin, daptomycin, IV vancomycin, and gentamicin is used.[2] Gram-negative coverage may entail the use of fluoroquinolones, piperacillin/tazobactam, or carbapenems.[3]\nDespite multiple studies, there is no consensus on how long antibiotics should be given.[24] Generally, antibiotics are administered until surgeons decide that no further debridement is needed, and the patient no longer shows any systemic signs of infection from a clinical and laboratory standpoint.[3] Evidence regarding the efficacy of treatment and adverse effects is also unclear.",
    "Epidemiology": "Necrotizing fasciitis occurs in about 4 people per million per year in the U.S., and about 1 per 100,000 in Western Europe.[4]  About 1,000 cases of necrotizing fasciitis occur per year in the United States, but the rates have been increasing. This could be due to increasing awareness of this condition and increased reporting, or increasing antibiotic resistance.[2]  Both sexes are affected equally.[2] It is more common among older people and is rare in children.[4]\nNecrotizing fasciitis can occur at any part of the body, but it is more commonly seen at the extremities, perineum, and genitals. A small fraction of cases arise in the head/neck, chest and abdomen.[2]"

    "Disease": "Nelson%27s syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The common symptoms include:[citation needed]",
    "Causes": "Common causes include bilateral adrenalectomy for the treatment of Cushing's disease and hypopituitarism.[5] The onset of the disease can occur up to 24 years after bilateral adrenalectomy has been performed, with an average of up to 15 years after.[6] A preventative measure that can be utilized is prophylactic radiotherapy when bilateral adrenalectomy is being performed to prevent Nelson's syndrome from manifesting.[7] Screening can also be done with the help of an MRI in order to visualize the pituitary for tumors. If tumors are not present then an MRI should be performed at intervals.[8] Hyper-pigmentation and fasting ACTH levels within plasma above 154 pmol/L are predictive of Nelson's syndrome after an adrenalectomy.[8] Risk factors include being younger in age and pregnancy.[2]",
    "Diagnosis": "Common diagnostic techniques include: [11]\nBlood samples are assessed for the absence or presence of aldosterone and cortisol.[4] Physical examinations are also useful in patients to examine vision, skin pigmentation, how the body replaces steroids, and the cranial nerves.[5] Recent advancements in high-resolution MRIs allow for adenomas to be detected during the early stages of Nelson syndrome.[2] Physical examination including height, weight, vital signs, blood pressure, eye examination, thyroid examination, abdominal examination, neurological examination, skin examination, and pubertal staging needs to be assessed.[5] Through blood pressure and pulse readings can indicate hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency.[5] Hyper-pigmentation, hyporeflexia, and loss of vision can also indicate Nelson's syndrome when assessed together.[5] Specifically for a child who might have Nelson's syndrome, the patient should be questioned about the symptoms of the disease, as well as symptoms of other diseases to narrow down which disease the patient presents with. The patient should be questioned about how often and to what degree headaches, visual disturbances, and symptoms associated with pituitary malfunction occur. Additionally, adrenal steroid replacement should be assessed.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Common treatments for Nelson's syndrome include radiation or surgical procedure. Radiation allows for the limitation of the growth of the pituitary gland and the adenomas. If the adenomas start to affect the surrounding structures of the brain, then a micro-surgical technique can be adapted to remove the adenomas in a transsphenoidal (bone at the base of the skull) process.[4] Death may result in development of a locally aggressive pituitary tumor. However, does not commonly occur with pituitary diseases.[10] In the rare case, ACTH-secreting tumors can become malignant. Morbidity from the disease can occur due to pituitary tissue compression or replacement, and compression of structures that surround the pituitary fossa.[2] The tumor can also compress the optic apparatus, disturb cerebrospinal fluid flow, meningitis, and testicular enlargement in rare cases.[2]"

    "Disease": "Nemaline myopathy",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Signs vary from person to person. Young children and babies lack movement and have a difficult time eating and breathing. For young children not diagnosed immediately at birth, these are usually the first visible symptoms. One sign is a swollen face in disproportional areas. Other examples in newborns include swaying and a difficulty in moving. Other symptoms include feeble muscles in the neck and upper rib cage area. In adults, the most common symptom is respiratory problems.[7] Other symptoms in adults could range from mild to severe speech impediments.  It is common to be diagnosed with scoliosis in relation to nemaline myopathy.[8]\nAs babies that have NM develop and become of age when they should start walking, many take longer than average due to the lack of muscle, or just muscle fatigue.[9]\nSince facial muscles are involved in NM takeover, elongated faces and a lower mandible are often observed in people with NM. People affected by NM usually will begin to feel muscle exhaustion between ages 20–50. NM is usually not progressive. Gastroesophageal reflux, although not common, is associated with NM. Heart abnormalities can occur as a result of NM, but the likelihood of that happening are not high.[7]\nMost children with mild NM eventually walk independently, although often at a later age than their peers.  Some use wheelchairs or other devices, such as walkers or braces, to enhance their mobility.  Individuals with severe NM generally have limited limb movement and use wheelchairs full-time. Due to weakness in the trunk muscles, people with NM are prone to scoliosis, which usually develops in childhood and worsens during puberty.  Many individuals with NM undergo spinal fusion surgery to straighten and stabilize their backs.[citation needed]\nAlthough patients early on often have mobility in their joints that is past the normal range, as they age, joint deformities and scoliosis usually occur.[10] If the person with nemaline myopathy keeps an eye on his or her joints early on, the problems with them can be detected when they begin and their progression can be delayed. Treatment of joint problems ranges from stretching exercises with physical therapy to surgical introduction of braces. The benefits of exercise in people with nemaline myopathy are still being studied, however, researchers have seen improvements in muscle function from low-intensity exercise. Vigorous exercise and the use of heavy weights should be avoided.[citation needed]\nAttention to respiratory issues is critical to the health of many people with NM.  Infants with severe NM frequently experience respiratory distress at or soon after birth, although this is only found in the rarest forms. Though respiratory compromise may not be immediately apparent in people with intermediate or mild NM, it often, but not always, exists to some extent.  As in many neuromuscular disorders, hypoventilation can begin insidiously, and it may cause serious health problems if not remedied by the use of noninvasive mechanical devices to assist breathing, particularly at night.[citation needed]\nBulbar (throat) muscle weakness is a main feature of nemaline myopathy. Individuals with the most severe forms of NM are unable to swallow and receive their nutrition through feeding tubes.  Most people with intermediate and mild NM take some or all of their nutrition orally.  Bulbar muscle impairment may also lead to difficulty with communication.  People with NM often have hypernasal speech as a result of poor closure of the velopharyngeal port (between the soft palate and the back of the throat). This may be able to be surgically corrected. Communicative skills may be enhanced through speech therapy, oral prosthetic devices, surgery, and augmentative communication devices.  NM does not have any impact on cognition or intelligence.[citation needed]\nPhysical expression of nemaline myopathy varies greatly, but weakness is usually concentrated in the proximal muscles, particularly respiratory, bulbar and trunk muscles.[11]  People with severe NM show obvious symptoms at birth, while those with intermediate or mild NM may initially appear unaffected.  Babies with NM are frequently observed to be \"floppy\" and hypotonic.  Children born with NM often gain strength as they grow, though the effect of muscle weakness on body features may become more evident with time.  Adults with NM typically have a very slender physique.[11]",
    "Causes": "Nemaline myopathy is caused by mutations in one of at least 11 different genes.[2][12]  Nemaline myopathy is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder and both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms can occur.  Diagnosis is made based upon clinical signs such as muscle weakness, absent or low deep tendon reflexes (hyporeflexia), and a high-arched palate,  along with electron-dense aggregates, called nemaline rods, being observed at the microscopic level within muscle fibers.  Genetic confirmation through identification of a known genetic mutation in the patient is also an important component of diagnosis.[13][14]\nThe two most common gene mutations causing nemaline myopathy are found on NEB or ACTA1.[15] Mutations of the NEB gene usually result in symptoms present at birth or beginning in early childhood. This mutation results in about 50% of affected nemaline myopathy patients. The most common inheritance pathway for those with mutations in NEB is autosomal recessive in which each parent carries one mutated copy along with one normal functioning copy of the gene, and they pass the mutated copy to their offspring. In some cases, occasionally with ACTA1 mutations, NM can be caused by an inheritance pattern of autosomal dominance.  This mutation results in about 15 to 25 percent of NM cases.[16]  One reason why this is lower is because NM is associated with de novo mutations in ACTA1, occurring spontaneously in the egg or sperm.[9] When the condition is heritable, each pregnancy with the same partners has the same risk of passing the mutated genes to offspring.  New mutations (de novo) can also occur causing NM and de novo mutations have been most often found to occur in the ACTA1 gene.[16]\nMYPN is the last found gene related to NM The risk of all cases of nemaline myopathy is the same in males and females.[9]\nThe physical capabilities of a given person with NM do not correlate well either with genotype or with muscle pathology as observed in the biopsy.[18]",
    "Treatment": "At present, Nemaline myopathy does not have a cure. Nemaline myopathy is a very rare disease that only affects 1 out of 50,000 on average, although recent studies show that this number is even smaller. There are a number of treatments to minimize the symptoms of the disease. The treatments and procedures to help patients with nemaline myopathy vary depending on the severity of the disease. A possible accommodation could be the use of a stabilizer, such as a brace. Other means include moderate stretching and moderate exercise to help target muscles maintain maximum health.[22]\nAs people with NM grow and develop throughout their lives, it is important for them to see a variety of health professionals regularly, including a neurologist, physical therapist, and others, such as speech therapists and psychologists, to help both the patient and family adjust to everyday life.[10]",
    "Prognosis": "Although there is no cure for NM, it is possible, and common for many people live healthy active lives even with moderate to severe cases.[23] Research continues to seek ways to ameliorate debilitating symptoms and lengthen the life-span in quality ways for those affected.  Some people have seen mild improvements in secretion handling, energy level, and physical functioning with supplemental L-tyrosine, an amino acid that is available through health centers.[24]  Some symptoms may worsen as the patient ages.  Muscle loss increases with age naturally, but it is even more significant with nemaline myopathy.[25]",
    "Society and culture": "In 1999, the NM Community[29] and first website (www.nemaline.org[30]) for nemaline myopathy was launched by David McDougall, and in October 2004, the first Nemaline Myopathy Conference was hosted in Toronto, Canada, by Nemaline Myopathy Support Group.  Many more conferences and social events have been held since, and all events organized since 2008 have been co-sponsored by A Foundation Building Strength for Nemaline Myopathy (AFBS),[31] the only foundation focused on supporting treatment development and social events for the NM community.  In March 2006, Niki Shisler released a book, Fragile, in which she recounted her experiences surrounding the birth of twin sons with severe NM. In 2014, a team of experts collaborated with affected individuals and families caring for someone with a congenital myopathy to develop the first guidebook on managing life with a congenital myopathy[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "Neonatal diabetes",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The first sign of neonatal diabetes is often slowed fetal growth, followed by unusually low birthweight.[4] At some point within the first six months of life, infants with neonatal diabetes tend to experience the classic symptoms of type 1 diabetes: thirst, frequent urination, and signs of dehydration.[4] The timing of symptom onset varies with the type of neonatal diabetes. Those with transient neonatal diabetes tend to have symptoms in the first few days or weeks of life, with affected children showing weight loss and signs of dehydration, along with high levels of sugar in the blood and urine. Some children also have high levels of ketones in the blood and urine, or signs of metabolic acidosis.[5] Permanent neonatal diabetes starts slightly later, typicalaly around six weeks of age. Regardless of type, preterm infants tend to experience symptoms earlier, typically around one week of age.[6]\nNeonatal diabetes is classified into three subtypes: permanent, transient, and syndromic; each with distinct genetic causes and symptoms.[5]\nSyndromic neonatal diabetes is the term for diabetes as just one component of any of several complex syndromes that affect neonates, including IPEX syndrome, Wolcott-Rallison syndrome, and Wolfram syndrome. Symptoms vary widely based on the syndrome.[5]\nPeople with KATP channel variations are at increased risk of developing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, sleep disruptions, seizures, and experiencing developmental delay – all due to the presence of KATP channels in the brain.[7] These can range from unnoticeably mild to severe, and can sometimes improve with sulfonylurea treatment.[7]\nThose with 6q24 overexpression tend to have transient diabetes, with hyperglycemia tending to disappear within the first year of life.[7] Despite the return of euglycemia, people with 6q24 overexpression are at high risk of developing diabetes later in life, as teenagers or adults.[7]\nMany of the genetic variations that cause neonatal diabetes are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, i.e. receiving a single copy of the disease-associated variant results in disease. This is the case for the KATP genes KCNJ11 and ABCC8, and paternally inherited 6q24 amplifications, any of which have a 50% chance of being transmitted to each offspring of an affected individual.[7]",
    "Causes": "Neonatal diabetes is a genetic disease, caused by genetic variations that were either spontaneously acquired or inherited from one's parents. At least 30 distinct genetic variants can result in neonatal diabetes.[8] The development and treatment of neonatal diabetes will vary based on the particular genetic cause. Known genetic variants cause neonatal diabetes by five major mechanisms: Preventing the development of the pancreas or β cells, promoting β-cell death by autoimmunity or endoplasmic reticulum stress, preventing β cells from recognizing glucose or secreting insulin, or abnormal expression of the 6q24 region on chromosome 6.[8]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis of neonatal diabetes is complicated by the fact that hyperglycemia is common in neonates – particularly in preterm infants, 25–75% of whom have hyperglycemia.[6] Neonatal hyperglycemia typically begins in the first ten days of life, and lasts just two to three days.[6]\nThe diagnostic evaluations are based upon the following evaluation factors: patients with TNDM are more likely to have intrauterine growth retardation and less likely to develop ketoacidosis than patients with PNDM. TNDM patients are younger at the age of diagnosis of diabetes and have lower insulin requirements, an overlap occurs  between the two groups, therefore TNDM cannot be distinguished from PNDM based clinical feature. An early onset of diabetes mellitus is unrelated to autoimmunity in most cases, relapse of diabetes is common with TNDM, and extensive follow ups are important. In addition, molecular analysis of chromosomes 6  defects,  KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes (encoding Kir6.2 and SUR1) provide a way to identify PNDM in the infant stages. Approximately 50% of PNDM are associated with the potassium channel defects which are essential consequences when changing patients from insulin therapy to sulfonylureas.[citation needed]\nThe uniparental disomy of the chromosome  can be used as diagnostic method provide proof by the analysis of polymorphic markers is present on Chromosome 6. Meiotic segregation of the chromosome can be distinguished by comparing allele profiles of polymorphic makers in the child to the child's parents' genome. Normally, a total uniparental disomy of the chromosome 6 is evidenced, but partial one can be identified. Therefore, genetic markers that are close to the region of interest in chromosome 6q24 can be selected. Chromosome duplication can found by that technique also.[citation needed]\nSamples from fetus or child and both parents are needed for analysis. Chromosome of interest must be specified on request form.  For prenatal samples (only): if the amniotic fluid (non-confluent culture cells) are provided.[14] Amniotic fluid is added and charged separately. Also, if chorionic villus sample is provided, a genetic test will be added and charged separately. Microsatellites markers and polymerase chain reaction are used on the chromosomes of interest to test the DNA of the parent and child to identify the presence of uniparental disomy[14].",
    "Treatment": "Neonates with diabetes are initially treated by intravenous infusion of insulin, with a dose of 0.05 units/kilogram/hour commonly used.[15]\nTreatment options depend on the underlying genetic variations of each person with neonatal diabetes. The most common mutations underlying neonatal diabetes – KCNJ11 and ABCC8 variants – can be treated with sulfonylureas alone, eventually transitioning off of insulin completely.[15]\nIn many cases, neonatal diabetes may be treated with oral sulfonylureas such as glyburide. Physicians may order genetic tests to determine whether or not transitioning from insulin to sulfonylurea drugs is appropriate for a patient.[citation needed]\nPeople whose disease is caused by KATP variants can often be treated with high-dose sulfonylureas, which directly promote the closure of the KATP channel.[7]",
    "Prognosis": "The outcome for infants or adults with NDM have different outcomes among carriers of the disease.  Among affected babies, some have PNDM while others have relapse of their diabetes and other patients may experience permanent remission. Diabetes may reoccur in the patient's childhood or adulthood. It was estimated that neonatal diabetes mellitus will be TNDM  in about 50% are half of the cases.[16]\nDuring the Neonatal stage, the prognosis is determined by the severity of the disease (dehydration and acidosis), also based on how rapidly the disease is diagnosed and treated. Associated abnormalities (e.g. irregular growth in the womb or enlarged tongue) can effect a person's prognosis.[16] The long-term prognosis depends on the person's metabolic control, which effects the presence and complications of diabetes complications.[16] The prognosis can be confirmed with genetic analysis to find the genetic cause of the disease. With proper management, the prognosis for overall health and normal brain development is normally good. It is highly advised people living with NDM seek prognosis from their health care provider.[citation needed]",
    "Epidemiology": "About 1 in 90,000 to 160,000 children born develops neonatal diabetes, with approximately half developing permanent and half transient neonatal diabetes.[17][18]"

    "Disease": "Neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The age of onset is almost always before 3 months of age. Many infants are born preterm (1/3 cases) and dysmature. The babies are frequently small for dates. The placenta may be abnormal with non-specific inflammation on histology. Umbilical cord anomalies have occasionally been reported. In severe cases, signs in the brain may be detected on prenatal ultrasound.\nThe disease manifests in many forms, making the diagnosis difficult, but the most common features of this disease involve the skin, joints, and central nervous system.\nAll have a maculopapular urticarial skin rash that is often present at birth (75% cases). It is probably more correctly described as an urticarial-like rash. The presence of the rash varies with time, and biopsy of these skin lesions shows a perivascular inflammatory infiltrate including granulocytes.\nIn about 35–65% of cases, arthritis occurs. Joint signs are variably expressed and can lead to transient swelling without sequelae between crises, or to unpredictable anomalies of growth cartilage and long bones epiphyses suggestive of a pseudo-tumour. Biopsies reveal hypertrophic cartilage without inflammatory cells. This most commonly affects the large joints (knees, ankles, elbows, and wrists) but may also involve the small joints of the hands and feet. It is usually bilateral and painful. A common and characteristic feature is giant kneecaps. Severe cases may result in contractures (joint deformities).\nMost patients eventually have neurological problems. These manifest themselves in three principal ways: chronic meningitis, involvement of both the optic tract and eye, and sensorineural hearing loss. The chronic meningitis presents with the features of chronically raised intracranial pressure: headaches, vomiting, ventriculomegaly, hydrocephalus, macromegaly, cerebral atrophy, and optic atrophy. Some of these features may be evidenced on prenatal ultrasound. In 50% of cases, intellectual deficit occurs. Seizures occur in 25% of cases, but other manifestations are rare. Histological examination shows infiltration of the meninges with polymorphs.\nOcular manifestations occur in 80% of cases and include uveitis (70%), papillary involvement, conjunctivitis, and optical neuritis. If untreated, these may result in blindness (25%). The sensorineural hearing loss occurs in 75%, and tends to be progressive leading to deafness in 20% of cases.\nAlmost all children are remarkably short and have growth delay. Fever is extremely common but inconstant and is most often mild. Anemia is frequent. Other findings that have been reported include macrocephaly (95%), large fontanelle, prominent forehead, flattening of the nasal bridge (saddleback nose), short and thick extremities, and finger clubbing. The liver and spleen may be enlarged. Lymph node enlargement may also be present.\nLater in life, secondary amyloidosis may occur. Delayed puberty and secondary amenorrhoea are not uncommon. Hoarseness due to inflammation of the laryngeal cartilage has also been reported.",
    "Causes": "The disease is caused in 60% of cases by a mutated gene called CIAS1 that is known to be involved in other syndromes that appear somewhat similar, such as Muckle–Wells syndrome and familial cold urticaria. In many patients, the parents do not have the same mutation, indicating the problem was not inherited, even though it is a genetic disease. CIAS1 is involved in controlling the immune system, which is why the mutation leads to out-of-control inflammation.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is based on observing the patient and finding the constellation of symptoms and signs described above. A few blood tests help, by showing signs of long-standing inflammation. There is no specific test for the disease, though now that the gene that causes the disease is known, that may change.[citation needed]\nRoutine laboratory investigations are non-specific: anaemia, increased numbers of polymorphs, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and elevated concentrations of C-reactive protein are typically all the abnormalities found. Lumbar puncture shows elevated levels of polymorphs (20–70% of cases) and occasionally raised eosinophil counts (0–30% of cases). CSF neopterin may be elevated. The X ray abnormalities are unique and characteristic of this syndrome. These changes include bony overgrowth due to premature ossification of the patella and the long bone epiphyses in very young children and bowing of long bones with widening and shortening periosteal reaction in older ones.[citation needed]\nAudiometry shows a progressive sensineural deafness. Visual examination shows optic atrophy and an increase in the blind spot. CT is usually normal but may show enlargement of the ventricles. MRI with contrast may show enhancement of leptomeninges and cochlea consistent with chronic meningitis. EEG shows a non-specific pattern with slow waves and spike discharges.\nPolymorphs tend to show increased expression of CD10.\nStill's disease does not affect children under 6 months old. Hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome in 50% of cases is associated with mevalonate kinase deficiency which can be measured in the leukocytes.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "There have been attempts to control the inflammation using drugs that work in other conditions where inflammation is a problem. The most successful of these are steroids, but they have side effects when used long term. Other medications, including methotrexate, colchicine and canakinumab, have been tried with some success. Otherwise, the treatment is supportive, or aimed solely at controlling symptoms and maximizing function.[citation needed]",
    "Prognosis": "Overall, the prognosis for patients with NOMID is not good, though many (80%) live into adulthood, and a few appear to do relatively well. They are at risk for leukemia, infections, and some develop deposits of protein aggregated called amyloid, which can lead to kidney failure and other problems. The neurologic problems are most troubling. The finding that other diseases are related and a better understanding of where the disease comes from may lead to more effective treatments.[citation needed]",
    "Epidemiology": "This is a rare condition with an incidence estimated to be less than 1 in a million live births. About 100 cases have been reported worldwide. The bulk of cases are sporadic but familial forms with autosomal dominant transmission have also been described.[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The clinical manifestation is similar to neurogenic diabetes insipidus, presenting with polydipsia (excessive thirst) and polyuria (excretion of a large amount of dilute urine). Dehydration is common, and incontinence can occur secondary to chronic bladder distension.[1] On investigation, there will be an increased plasma osmolarity and decreased urine osmolarity. As pituitary function is normal, antidiuretic hormone levels are likely to be abnormal or raised. Polyuria will continue as long as the patient is able to drink. If the patient is unable to drink and is still unable to concentrate the urine, then hypernatremia will ensue with its neurologic symptoms.",
    "Causes": "Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is most common in its acquired forms, meaning that the defect was not present at birth. These acquired forms have numerous potential causes. The most obvious cause is a kidney or systemic disorder, including amyloidosis,[2] polycystic kidney disease,[3] electrolyte imbalance,[4][5] or some other kidney defect.[2]\nThe major causes of acquired nephrogenic diabetes insipidus that produce clinical symptoms (e.g., polyuria) in the adult are lithium toxicity and high blood calcium. About 80% of lithium ingested appears to affect the proximal tubules by entering the collecting tubule cells through sodium channels, accumulating and interfering with the normal response to antidiuretic hormone in a mechanism that is not yet fully understood.[6] High blood calcium causes natriuresis (increased sodium loss in the urine) and water diuresis, in part by its effect through the calcium-sensing receptor.\nOther causes of acquired nephrogenic diabetes insipidus include hypokalemia (low blood potassium), post-obstructive polyuria, sickle cell disease or trait, amyloidosis, Sjögren syndrome, renal cystic disease, Bartter syndrome, and various medications (amphotericin B, orlistat, ifosfamide, ofloxacin, cidofovir, vaptans).\nIn addition to kidney and systemic disorders, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus can present itself as a side effect of some medications. The most common and well known of these medications is lithium,[7] although there are many other medications that cause this effect with lesser frequency.[2]\nThis form of diabetes insipidus can also be hereditary due to defects in the following genes:",
    "Diagnosis": "Differential diagnosis includes nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, neurogenic/central diabetes insipidus and psychogenic polydipsia. They may be differentiated by using the water deprivation test.\nRecently, lab assays for antidiuretic hormone are available and can aid in diagnosis. If the patient is able to rehydrate properly, sodium concentration should be nearer to the maximum of the normal range. This, however, is not a diagnostic finding, as it depends on patient hydration.[citation needed]\nDesmopressin can also be used; if the patient is able to concentrate urine following administration of desmopressin, then the cause of the diabetes insipidus is neurogenic diabetes insipidus; if no response occurs to desmopressin, then the cause is likely to be nephrogenic.",
    "Treatment": "Persons with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus must consume enough fluids to equal the amount of urine produced.  Any underlying cause such as high blood calcium must be corrected to treat nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. The first line of treatment is hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride.[10] Patients may also consider a low-salt and low-protein diet.\nThiazide diuretics cause a mild decrease in extracellular fluid volume through natriuresis and diuresis which in turn increases the proximal absorption of sodium and water, lowering urine output.[11]\nHigh serum osmolarity stimulates polydipsia in an attempt to dilute the serum back to normal and provide free water for excreting the excess serum solutes. However, since the patient is unable to concentrate urine to excrete the excess solutes, the resulting urine fails to decrease serum osmolarity and the cycle repeats itself, hence polyuria."

    "Disease": "Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Clinical features of NSF develop within days to months and, in some cases, years following exposure to some GBCAs. The main symptoms are the thickening and hardening of the skin associated with brawny hyperpigmentation, typically presenting in a symmetric fashion. The skin gradually becomes fibrotic and adheres to the underlying fascia.[6][7] The symptoms initiate distally in the limbs and progress proximally, sometimes involving the trunk.[6] Joint contractures of the fingers, elbows and knees can develop secondary to skin involvement and can severely impair physical function.[6][8] While skin involvement is on the foreground, the process may involve any organ, e.g., the eye,[8] heart, diaphragm, pleura, pericardium, and kidneys,[6][9] as well as the lungs and liver.[10][11]",
    "Causes": "NSF is an iatrogenic disease caused by exposure to gadolinium-based contrast agents used in magnetic resonance imaging.[12]",
    "Diagnosis": "There is no specific imaging finding for NSF, and the diagnosis is a clinicopathological one, based on presentation and histological findings.[7]\nAt the microscopic level, NSF shows a proliferation of dermal fibroblasts and dendritic cells, thickened collagen bundles, increased elastic fibers, and deposits of mucin.[17] More recent case reports have described the presence of sclerotic bodies (also known as elastocollagenous balls) in skin biopsies from NSF patients. While not universally present, this finding is believed to be unique to patients exposed to gadolinium, although not necessarily limited to areas involved by NSF.[18][19][20]\nThe differential diagnoses for NSF include diffuse cutaneous or limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis, scleromyxedema, lipodermatosclerosis, scleroedema diabeticorum, graft versus host disease, eosinophilic fasciitis; eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome; porphyria cutanea tarda, and other disorders. The nearly universal absence of facial skin involvement in NSF, presence of yellow plaques on the sclera of the eyes, absence of Raynaud's phenomenon, and other differences in presentation can aid the proper diagnosis. History of exposure to GBCAs would favor NSF as the differential diagnosis.[6][8]",
    "Treatment": "Multiple therapies for NSF have been attempted, with variable clinical improvement. None have been as effective as restoration of kidney function. Restoration of kidney function by treating the underlying disease process, recovery from acute kidney injury (AKI), or performing a kidney transplant can slow or hold the progression of NSF. A few cases of curative kidney transplantation have been reported, and it is appropriate to consider transplantation as treatment.[6][7]",
    "Epidemiology": "NSF affects males and females in approximately equal numbers and has been reported in patients of different ethnic and geographic regions. It most often affects middle-aged individuals, but there are reports of cases occurring from childhood to senescence.[6][7]"

  {
    "Disease": "Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The signs and symptoms of NMOSD depend on the neurologic structures the disease affects, and, to some extent, the antibodies involved.\nThe most common initial manifestation of the disease is inflammation of the spinal cord (myelitis).[4] Myelitis causes spinal cord dysfunction, which can result in muscle weakness, paralysis in the limbs, lost or reduced sensation, spasms, loss of bladder and bowel control, or erectile dysfunction.[1][4][2][7][8][9] The myelitis can be transverse, affecting an entire cross-section of the spinal cord, and showing bilateral symptoms.\nThe second most common initial manifestation of the disease is inflammation of the optic nerve and/or optic chiasm (optic neuritis, ON).[4] ON may lead to varying degrees of visual impairment with decreased visual acuity, although visual field defects, or loss of color vision, may occur in isolation or prior to formal loss of visual acuity. Compared to idiopathic ON and ON due to multiple sclerosis (MS), ON due to NMOSD more often results in severe visual loss at onset, with bilateral involvement, and permanent visual deficits.[4]\nLess commonly than the spinal cord and optic nerve, NMOSD can affect the brain stem.[4] Lesions in the brain stem or upper cervical spinal cord can cause respiratory insufficiency. Lesions in the area postrema of the medulla oblongata can cause vomiting or hiccups, as well as pain and tonic spasms.[1][4] Additional brain lesions are common but often asymptomatic (though cognitive deficits, as well as depression, may be underdiagnosed sequalae). Lesions may also affect the diencephalon, mostly in Aquaporin-4–Immunoglobulin-G (AQP4-IgG) NMOSD.[1][4]\nSigns and symptoms usually follow a relapsing and remitting course, but occasionally can be progressive (monophasic). Deficits can be temporary or permanent, the latter especially in the absence of treatment.[citation needed]\nFatigue is a common symptom, with studies showing that as many as 77% of people with NMOSD have fatigue.[10][11] Fatigue has been found to correlate with quality of life in people with NMOSD.[12][13]\nNMO and multiple sclerosis (MS) can be similar in clinical and radiological presentation, and MS may very rarely present with an NMO-like phenotype (e.g. in patients with long-standing MS resulting in confluent spinal cord lesions mimicking the longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions typically seen in NMO). In consequence, NMO was in the past wrongly considered a clinical variant of MS. However, NMO is not related to MS in the vast majority of cases and differs from MS substantially in terms of pathogenesis, clinical presentation, magnetic resonance imaging, cerebrospinal fluid findings, disease course, and prognosis.[1]",
    "Causes": "NMOSD is caused by an autoimmune attack on the nervous system. In more than 80% of cases, IgG autoantibodies against aquaporin-4 (anti-AQP4+) are the cause, and in 10–40% of the remaining cases, IgG antibodies against MOG are the cause.[1] The cause of the remaining cases is still unknown, and it is likely heterogeneous.[14][15]\nWhy autoimmunity develops is largely unknown. Multiple genetic and environmental factors are known to increase the risk of developing NMOSD. The strongest risk factor is being female, especially in AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD.[1] Multiple human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles are associated with NMOSD.[1]\nNMO was associated in the past with many systemic diseases. Some researchers have pointed out that some other cases could be paraneoplastic.[16] It appears that lupus can produce NMO-IgG autoantibodies, leading to cases of lupus-derived NMO.[17]\nThe discovery of NMO-IgG (anti-AQP4) has opened a new avenue of research into the causes.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "NMOSD is diagnosed using consensus clinical criteria, which have undergone multiple revisions, most recently in 2015.[32][33]\nDiagnostic criteria are more relaxed for seropositive AQP4–IgG cases than they are for seronegative AQP4-IgG ones. If AQP4-IgG is detected, then one core clinical criterion, along with the ruling out of alternative diagnoses, is sufficient for NMOSD diagnosis.[34]\nIf AQP4-IgG is undetected, or its status is unknown, two core clinical criteria, each with supportive MRI findings, along with the ruling out of alternative diagnoses, are needed for an NMOSD diagnosis.[35]\nRarely, it has been reported that some courses of anti-NMDAR are consistent with NMO.[36] Preliminary reports suggest that other autoantibodies may play a role in rare cases of NMO.[37][38]\nNMOSD with MOG-IgG is considered a manifestation of anti-MOG associated encephalomyelitis.[39]\nAfter the development of the NMO-IgG test, the spectrum of disorders comprising NMO was expanded. The spectrum is now believed to consist of:\nAQP4-Ab-negative NMO presents problems for differential diagnosis. The behavior of the oligoclonal bands can help to establish a more accurate diagnosis. Oligoclonal bands in NMO are rare and they tend to disappear after attacks, while in MS they are nearly always present and persistent.[44] It is important to notice for differential diagnosis that, though uncommon, it is possible to have longitudinal lesions in MS.[45]\nAnother problem for diagnosis is that AQP4-ab in MOG-ab levels can be too low to be detected. Some additional biomarkers have been proposed.[46][47]\nNMO differs from MS in that it usually has more severe sequelae after an acute episode than standard MS, which infrequently presents as transverse myelitis. In addition oligoclonal bands in the CSF as well as white matter lesions on brain MRIs are uncommon in NMO, but occur in over 90% of MS patients.[48]\nRecently, the presence of AQP4 has been found to distinguish standard MS from NMO; but as MS is a heterogeneous condition,[49] and some MS cases are reported to be Kir4.1 channelopathies[50] (autoimmunity against the potassium channels), it is still possible to consider NMO as part of the MS spectrum. Besides, some NMO-AQP4(−) variants are not astrocytopathic, but demyelinating.[51]\nTumefactive demyelinating lesions in NMO are not usual, but they have been reported to appear in several cases mistakenly treated with interferon beta.[52]\nAlso, an overlap with Sjögren syndrome has been reported.[53]\nSince the discovery of the AQP4 autoantibody, it has been found that it appears also in patients with NMO-like symptoms that do not fulfill the clinical requirements to be diagnosed with NMO (recurrent and simultaneous optic nerve and spinal cord inflammation).[54]\nThe term neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) has been designed to allow incorporation of cases associated with non-AQP4 biomarkers.[33] Therefore, it includes all the clinical variants due to anti-AQP4, plus other non-related but clinically similar syndromes such as anti-MOG associated encephalomyelitis. Some cases with MOG+ and AQP4+ antibodies have been found.[33]\nThese variants are expected to respond to the same treatments as standard NMO.[55] Some authors propose to use the name \"autoimmune aquaporin-4 channelopathy\" for these diseases,[15] while others prefer a more generic term \"AQP4-astrocytopathy\", which also includes deficiencies of AQP4 with a non-autoimmune origin.[56]",
    "Treatment": "There is no cure for NMO, but it is treatable. Some patients recover, but many are left with impairment of vision and limbs, which can be severe in some cases.[57]\nLong term neurologic deficits are the cumulative effects of acute attacks, emphasizing the importance of acute treatment.[1] Traditionally, attacks have been treated with short courses (3–5 days) of high dosage intravenous corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone IV (Solu-Medrol).[58] Early initiation of treatment with steroids has been shown to improve vision-related outcomes after acute attacks.[1][59] However, there is no high-level evidence for steroids affecting long-term outcomes; this treatment strategy was borrowed from that for similar diseases (idiopathic optic neuritis and multiple sclerosis).[59][58]\nPlasmapheresis can be an effective treatment when attacks progress after the administration of corticosteroids.[41] This treatment involves the patient's own blood being pumped out, blood cells being removed from the plasma and mixed with a solution, then the new blood mixture being pumped back in.[57]\nProphylactic treatment, to prevent relapses of NMO, is generally employed; but the exact duration of such treatment is debatable.[60]\nFDA-approved pharmaceuticals against AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD, shown to be effective in phase III clinical trials, first became available in 2019.[1] As of 2020, they are among the most expensive drugs worldwide.[1] They are not available in pill form, which, along with their high price, limits their accessibility.[1] These new drugs' effectiveness against AQP4-IgG-negative NMOSD is unknown.[1]\nMany treatments are used despite the lack of phase III clinical trials testing their efficacy.[1] Neither inferiority nor superiority to the newer, FDA approved drugs has been clearly demonstrated; and, considering their being relatively inexpensive and being availability in pill format, these drugs are the current standard treatment.[1] Most of these medications affect the immune system in various ways.[58][41][65]\nIt is important to note that certain immunosuppressants used to treat MS—such as interferon-β, fingolimod, natalizumab, and alemtuzumab—worsen NMO disease progression and should not be used to treat NMO.[70]",
    "Prognosis": "Normally, some improvement appears in a few weeks, but severe residual symptoms and even disability may persist.[citation needed]\nThe disease can be monophasic, i.e. a single episode with permanent remission afterwards. However, at least 85% of patients have a relapsing form of the disease with repeated attacks of transverse myelitis and/or optic neuritis. In patients with the monophasic form, the transverse myelitis and optic neuritis occur simultaneously or within days of each other. On the other hand, patients with the relapsing form are more likely to have weeks or months between the initial attacks, and to have better motor recovery after the initial transverse myelitis event. Relapses usually occur early, with about 55% of patients having a relapse in the first year and 90% in the first five years.[18]\nIt is possible that the relapsing form is related to the anti-AQP4+ seropositive status and the monophasic form related to its absence.[71] Unlike MS, NMO rarely has a secondary progressive phase in which patients have increasing neurologic decline between attacks without remission. Instead, disabilities arise from the acute attacks.[18]\nApproximately 20% of patients with monophasic NMO have permanent visual loss, and 30% have permanent paralysis in one or both legs. Among patients with relapsing NMO, 50% have blindness or paralysis within five years. In some patients (33% in one study), transverse myelitis in the cervical spinal cord resulted in respiratory failure and subsequent death. However, the spectrum of NMO has widened, due to improved diagnostic criteria; and the options for treatment have improved. As a result, researchers believe these estimates will be lowered.[18]",
    "Epidemiology": "Prevalence varies by region, ranging from 0.5 to 10 cases per 100,000 people.[1] Unlike MS, prevalence has not been found to be related to latitude.[1] NMO is more common in women than men, with women comprising over two-thirds of patients and more than 80% of those with the relapsing form of the disease.[18]\nA retrospective study found that prevalence of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders was 1.5% among a random sample of neurological patients, with a MS:NMOSD ratio of 42:7. Among 13 NMOSD patients, 77% had long spinal cord lesions, 38% had severe optic neuritis, and 23% had brain or brainstem lesions. Only 56% had clinically definite NMO at follow-up.[72]\nNMO is more common in Asians than Caucasians. In fact, Asian optic-spinal multiple sclerosis (OSMS) (which constitutes 30% of the cases of MS in Japan) has been suggested to be identical to NMO (differences between OSMS and classic MS in Japanese patients). In the indigenous populations of tropical and subtropical regions, MS is rare; but when it appears, it often takes the form of OSMS.[73]\nThe majority of NMO patients have no affected relatives, and it is generally regarded as a nonfamilial condition.[18]\nRarely, NMO may occur in the context of other autoimmune diseases (e.g. connective tissue disorders, paraneoplastic syndromes) or infectious diseases. In some cases, the etiology remains unknown (idiopathic NMO).[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "Neuromyotonia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "NMT is a diverse disorder. As a result of muscular hyperactivity, patients may present with muscle cramps, stiffness, myotonia-like symptoms (slow relaxation), associated walking difficulties, hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), myokymia (quivering of a muscle), fasciculations (muscle twitching), fatigue, exercise intolerance, myoclonic jerks and other related symptoms. These neuromyotonic discharges can cause bursts of spontaneous motor activity that present either continuously or in recurring, decrementing clusters. They can start and stop abruptly, typically waning in strength and are unaffected by voluntary activity.[3]\nThe symptoms (especially the stiffness and fasciculations) are most prominent in the calves, legs, trunk, and sometimes the face and neck, but can also affect other body parts. NMT symptoms may fluctuate in severity and frequency. Symptoms range from mere inconvenience to debilitating. At least a third of people also experience sensory symptoms.",
    "Causes": "The three causes of NMT are:[citation needed]\nThe acquired form is the most common, accounting for up to 80 percent of all cases and is suspected to be autoimmune-mediated, which is usually caused by antibodies against the neuromuscular junction.\nThe exact cause is unknown. However, autoreactive antibodies can be detected in a variety of peripheral (e.g. myasthenia gravis, Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome) and central nervous system (e.g. paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis) disorders. Their causative role has been established in some of these diseases but not all. Neuromyotonia is considered to be one of these with accumulating evidence for autoimmune origin over the last few years.[4] Autoimmune neuromyotonia is typically caused by antibodies that bind to potassium channels on the motor nerve resulting in continuous/hyper-excitability.  Onset is typically seen between the ages of 15–60, with most experiencing symptoms before the age of 40.[5] Some neuromyotonia cases do not only improve after plasma exchange but they may also have antibodies in their serum samples against voltage-gated potassium channels.[6] Moreover, these antibodies have been demonstrated to reduce potassium channel function in neuronal cell lines.\nIt is suspected that the peripheral nerve hyperexcitability associated with Isaacs' and Morvan's syndromes is a result of a potassium channel defect in the motor nerve membrane.[3]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is clinical and initially consists of ruling out more common conditions, disorders, and diseases, and usually begins at the general practitioner level. A doctor may conduct a basic neurological exam, including coordination, strength, reflexes, sensation, etc. A doctor may also run a series of tests that include blood work and MRIs.\nFrom there, a patient is likely to be referred to a neurologist or a neuromuscular specialist. The neurologist or specialist may run a series of more specialized tests, including needle electromyography EMG/ and nerve conduction studies (NCS) (these are the most important tests), chest CT (to rule out paraneoplastic) and specific blood work looking for voltage-gated potassium channel antibodies, acetylcholine receptor antibody, and serum immunofixation, TSH, ANA ESR, EEG etc. Neuromyotonia is characterized electromyographically by doublet, triplet or multiplet single unit discharges that have a high, irregular intraburst frequency.  Fibrillation potentials and fasciculations are often also present with electromyography.[7]\nBecause the condition is so rare, it can often be years before a correct diagnosis is made.\nNMT is not fatal and many of the symptoms can be controlled. However, because NMT mimics some symptoms of motor neuron disease (ALS) and other more severe diseases, which may be fatal, there can often be significant anxiety until a diagnosis is made. In some rare cases, acquired neuromyotonia has been misdiagnosed as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)[8] particularly if fasciculations may be evident in the absence of other clinical features of ALS. However, fasciculations are rarely the first sign of ALS as the hallmark sign is weakness.[9] Similarly, multiple sclerosis has been the initial misdiagnosis in some NMT patients. In order to get an accurate diagnosis see a trained neuromuscular specialist.\nPeople diagnosed with benign fasciculation syndrome or enhanced physiological tremor may experience similar symptoms as NMT, although it is unclear today whether BFS or EPT are weak forms of NMT.\nThere are three main types of NMT:[citation needed]\nNeuromyotonia is a type of peripheral nerve hyperexcitability. Peripheral nerve hyperexcitability is an umbrella diagnosis that includes (in order of severity of symptoms from least severe to most severe) benign fasciculation syndrome, cramp fasciculation syndrome, neuromyotonia and morvan's syndrome. Some doctors will only give the diagnosis of peripheral nerve hyperexcitability as the differences between the three are largely a matter of the severity of the symptoms and can be subjective. However, some objective EMG criteria have been established to help distinguish between the three.\nMoreover, the generic use of the term peripheral nerve hyperexcitability syndromes to describe the aforementioned conditions is recommended and endorsed by several prominent researchers and practitioners in the field.[10]",
    "Treatment": "There is no known cure for neuromyotonia, but the condition is treatable. Anticonvulsants, including phenytoin and carbamazepine, usually provide significant relief from the stiffness, muscle spasms, and pain associated with neuromyotonia. Plasma exchange and IVIg treatment may provide short-term relief for patients with some forms of the acquired disorder.[5] It is speculated that the plasma exchange causes an interference with the function of the voltage-dependent potassium channels, one of the underlying issues of hyper-excitability in autoimmune neuromyotonia.[11] Botox injections also provide short-term relief. Immunosuppressants such as Prednisone may provide long term relief for patients with some forms of the acquired disorder.",
    "Prognosis": "The long-term prognosis is uncertain, and has mostly to do with the underlying cause; i.e. autoimmune, paraneoplastic, etc. However, in recent years increased understanding of the basic mechanisms of NMT and autoimmunity has led to the development of novel treatment strategies. NMT disorders are now amenable to treatment and their prognoses are good. Many patients respond well to treatment, which usually provide significant relief of symptoms. Some cases of spontaneous remission have been noted, including Isaac's original two patients when followed up 14 years later.\nWhile NMT symptoms may fluctuate, they generally don't deteriorate into anything more serious, and with the correct treatment the symptoms are manageable.\nA very small proportion of cases with NMT may develop central nervous system findings in their clinical course, causing a disorder called Morvan's syndrome, and they may also have antibodies against potassium channels in their serum samples. Sleep disorder is only one of a variety of clinical conditions observed in Morvan's syndrome cases ranging from confusion and memory loss to hallucinations and delusions. However, this is a separate disorder.\nSome studies have linked NMT with certain types of cancers, mostly lung and thymus, suggesting that NMT may be paraneoplastic in some cases. In these cases, the underlying cancer will determine prognosis. However, most examples of NMT are autoimmune and not associated with cancer."

    "Disease": "Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The classic characterization of the group of neurodegenerative, lysosomal storage disorders called the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) is through the progressive, permanent loss of motor and psychological ability with a severe intracellular accumulation of lipofuscins,[2][3] with the United States and Northern European populations having slightly higher frequency with an occurrence of one in 10,000.[4] Four classic diagnoses have received the most attention from researchers and the medical field, differentiated from one another by age of symptomatic onset, duration, early-onset manifestations such as blindness or seizures, and the forms which lipofuscin accumulation takes.[2]\nIn the early infantile variant of NCL (also called INCL or Santavuori-Haltia), probands appear normal at birth, but early visual loss leading to complete retinal blindness by the age of 2 years is the first indicator of the disease; by 3 years of age, a vegetative state is reached, and by 4 years, isoelectric encephalograms confirm brain death. Late infantile variant usually manifests between 2 and 4 years of age with seizures and deterioration of vision. The maximum age before death for late infantile variant is 10–12 years.[5][6][7][8] Juvenile NCL (JNCL, Batten disease, or Spielmeyer-Vogt), with a prevalence of one in 100,000, usually arises between 4 and 10 years of age; the first symptoms include considerable vision loss due to retinal dystrophy, with seizures, psychological degeneration, and eventual death in the mid- to late 20s or 30s ensuing.[9] Adult variant NCL (ANCL or Kuf's disease) is less understood and generally manifests milder symptoms; however, while symptoms typically appear around 30 years of age, death usually occurs 10 years later.[1]\nAll the mutations that have been associated with this disease have been linked to genes involved with the neural synapses metabolism – most commonly with the reuse of vesicle proteins.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "Because vision loss is often an early sign, NCL may be first suspected during an eye exam. An eye doctor can detect a loss of cells within the eye that occurs in the three childhood forms of NCL. However, because such cell loss occurs in other eye diseases, the disorder cannot be diagnosed by this sign alone. Often, an eye specialist or other physician who suspects NCL may refer the child to a neurologist, a doctor who specializes in disease of the brain and nervous system. To diagnose NCL, the neurologist needs the patient's medical history and information from various laboratory tests.[citation needed]\nDiagnostic tests used for NCLs include:\nThe older classification of NCL divided the condition into four types (CLN1, CLN2, CLN3, and CLN4) based upon age of onset, while newer classifications divide it by the associated gene.[11][12]\nCLN4 (unlike CLN1, CLN2, and CLN3) has not been mapped to a specific gene.\nNonsense and frameshift mutations in the CLN1 gene (located at\n1p32[15][16][17]) always induce classical INCL, while some missense mutations have been associated with ANCL in addition to the infantile and juvenile forms. The mutation typically results in a deficient form of a lysosomal enzyme called palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1).[18]\nThe wild-type PPT1 is a 306-amino acid polypeptide that is typically targeted for transport into lysosomes by the mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) receptor-mediated pathway.[5][18] Here, the protein appears to function in removing palmitate residues by cleaving thioester linkages in s-acylated (or palmitoylated) proteins, encouraging their breakdown.[5][6] Defective polypeptides, however, are unable to exit the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), most likely due to misfolding; further analyses of this pathway could serve to categorize INCL among lysosomal enzyme deficiencies. The human PPT gene shows 91% similarity to bovine PPT and 85% similarity to rat PPT; these data indicate that the PPT gene is highly conserved and likely plays a vital role in cell metabolism.[5] In addition, buildup of defective PPT1 in the ER has been shown to cause the increased release of Ca2+. This homeostasis-altering event leads to increased mitochondrial membrane permeability and subsequent activation of caspase-9, eventually leading to an accumulation of cleft and uncleft poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase  and eventual apoptosis.[6]\nThe CLN2 gene encodes a 46kDa protein called lysosomal tripeptidyl peptidase I (TPP1), which cleaves tripeptides from terminal amine groups of partially unfolded proteins.[7][19] Mutations of this gene typically result in a LINCL phenotype.[20]\nOn April 27, 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved cerliponase alfa (Brineura) as the first specific treatment for NCL. It is enzyme replacement therapy manufactured through recombinant DNA technology. The active ingredient in Brineura, cerliponase alfa, is intended to slow loss of walking ability in symptomatic pediatric patients 3 years of age and older with late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2), also known as TPP1 deficiency. Brineura is administered into the cerebrospinal fluid by infusion via a surgically implanted reservoir and catheter in the head (intraventricular access device).[21]\nAll mutations resulting in the juvenile variant of NCL have been shown to occur at the CLN3 gene on 16p12;[16] of the mutations known to cause JNCL, 85% result from a 1.02-kb deletion, with a loss of amino acids 154–438, while the remaining 15% appear to result from either point or frameshift mutations.[9] The wild-type CLN3 gene codes for a protein with no known function,[3] but studies of the yeast CLN3 ortholog, the product of which is called battenin (after its apparent connections to Batten's disease, or JNCL), have suggested that the protein may play a role in lysosomal pH homeostasis. Furthermore, recent studies have also implied the protein's role in cathepsin D deficiency; the overexpression of the defective protein appears to have significant effects on cathepsin D processing, with implications suggesting that accumulation of ATP synthase subunit C would result.[22] Only recently have studies of human patients shown deficiency of lysosomal aspartyl proteinase cathepsin D.[citation needed]\nBetween 1.3 and 10% of cases are of the adult form. The age at onset is variable (6–62 yr). Two main clinical subtypes have been described: progressive myoclonus epilepsy (type A) and dementia with motor disturbances, such as cerebellar, extrapyramidal signs and dyskinesia (type B). Unlike the other NCLs, retinal degeneration is absent. Pathologically, the ceroid-lipofuscin accumulates mainly in neurons and contains subunit C of the mitochondrial ATP synthase.[citation needed]\nTwo independent families have been shown to have mutations in the DNAJC5 gene – one with a transversion and the other with a deletion mutation.[23] The mutations occur in a cysteine-string domain, which is required for membrane targeting/binding, palmitoylation, and oligomerization of the encoded protein cysteine-string protein alpha (CSPα). The mutations dramatically decrease the affinity of CSPα for the membrane. A second report has also located this disease to this gene.[24]",
    "Treatment": "Currently, no widely accepted treatment can cure, slow down, or halt the symptoms in the great majority of patients with NCL, but seizures may be controlled or reduced with use of antiepileptic drugs. Additionally, physical, speech, and occupational therapies may help affected patients retain functioning for as long as possible.[citation needed] Several experimental treatments are under investigation.[citation needed]\nIn 2001, a drug used to treat cystinosis, a rare genetic disease that can cause kidney failure if not treated, was reported to be  useful in treating the infantile form of NCL. Preliminary results report the drug has completely cleared away storage material from the white blood cells of the first six patients, as well as slowing down the rapid neurodegeneration of infantile NCL. Currently, two drug trials are underway for infantile NCL, both using Cystagon.[citation needed]\nA gene therapy trial using an adenoassociated virus vector called AAV2CUhCLN2 began in June 2004 in an attempt to treat the manifestations of late infantile NCL.[25] The trial was conducted by Weill Medical College of Cornell University[25] and sponsored by the Nathan's Battle Foundation.[26] In May 2008,  the gene therapy given to the recipients reportedly was \"safe, and that, on average, it significantly slowed the disease's progression during the 18-month follow-up period\"[27] and \"suggested that higher doses and a better delivery system may provide greater benefit\".[28]\nA second gene therapy trial for late infantile NCL using an adenoassociated virus derived from the rhesus macaque (a species of Old World monkey) called AAVrh.10 began in August 2010, and is once again being conducted by Weill Medical College of Cornell University.[28] Animal models of late infantile NCL showed that the AAVrh.10 delivery system \"was much more effective, giving better spread of the gene product and improving survival greatly\".[28]\nA third gene therapy trial, using the same AAVrh.10 delivery system, began in 2011 and has been expanded to include late infantile NCL patients with moderate to severe impairment or uncommon genotypes, and uses a novel administration method that reduces general anesthesia time by 50% to minimize potential adverse side effects.[29]\nA painkiller available in several European countries, flupirtine, has been suggested to possibly slow down the progress of NCL,[30] particularly in the juvenile and late infantile forms. No trial has been officially supported in this venue, however. Currently, the drug is available to NCL families either from Germany, Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, or the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.[citation needed]\nOn October 20, 2005, the Food and Drug Administration approved a phase-I clinical trial of neural stem cells to treat infantile and late infantile Batten disease. Subsequent approval from an independent review board also approved the stem cell therapy in early March 2006. This treatment will be the first transplant of fetal stem cells performed on humans. The therapy is being developed by Stem Cells Inc and is estimated to have six patients. The treatment was to be carried out in Oregon.[31]\nJuvenile NCL has recently been listed on the Federal Clinical Trials website to test the effectiveness of bone-marrow or stem-cell transplants for this condition. A bone-marrow transplant has been attempted in the late infantile form of NCL with disappointing results; while the transplant may have slowed the onset of the disease, the child eventually developed the disease and died in 1998.[citation needed]\nTrials testing the effectiveness of bone-marrow transplants for infantile NCL in Finland have also been disappointing, with only a slight slowing of disease reported.[32]\nIn late 2007,  Dr. David Pearce et al. reported that Cellcept, an immunosuppressant medication commonly used in bone-marrow transplants, may be useful in slowing down the progress of juvenile NCL.[33]\nOn April 27, 2017, the U.S. FDA approved cerliponase alfa as the first specific treatment for NCL.[21]",
    "Epidemiology": "Incidence can vary greatly from type-to-type, and from country-to-country.[34]\nIn Germany, one study reported an incidence of 1.28 per 100,000.[35]\nA study in Italy reported an incidence of 0.56 per 100,000.[36]\nA study in Norway reported an incidence of 3.9 per 100,000 using the years from 1978 to 1999, with a lower rate in earlier decades.[37]"

    "Disease": "Neutral lipid storage disease",
    "Causes": "Neutral lipid storage disease is caused by the abnormal and excessive accumulation of lipids in certain bodily tissues, including the liver, the heart, and muscle.[4] Normally, these lipids are stored as lipid droplets and are normally used for metabolism, cell signaling and trafficking of vesicles.[2] Neutral lipid storage disease is a disease that is diagnosed with the simultaneous occurrence of myopathy and/or  ichthyosis. Myopathy is defined as a disease of the muscle tissue. Ichthyosis is a skin related disease in which the skin becomes very scaly, thick, and dry.[citation needed]\nNeutral lipid storage disease (NLSD) occurs in one of two genetic and clinical subtypes. Both subtypes are autosomal recessive disorders, meaning that a mutant allele must be inherited from both parents in order to cause disease.[citation needed]\nSubtype I: Neutral Lipid Storage Disease with Myopathy (NLSD-M), is caused by a mutation in the PNPLA2 gene, which reduces the normal expression or function of the ATGL protein. PNPLA2 is located on chromosome 11.[5] ATGL is an enzyme involved in catabolism of triglycerides (long-term fat storage) into fatty acids (short-term fat storage) within the body In the absence of fully functional ATGL, triglycerides accumulate in the bloodstream and bodily tissues. Interestingly, individuals with NLSD are not typically obese. It has been proposed that the assimilation, rather than degradation of triglycerides is the main factor in fat accumulation in adipose cells.[6] In the absence of functional ATGL, triglycerides accumulate in the bloodstream and bodily tissues.[2]  Patients with NLSD-M display progressive skeletal myopathy and severe cardiomyopathy in ~40% of cases.[7]  The pathophysiology and mechanistic basis of myopathy arising from deficits in lipid metabolism is not yet known.[citation needed]\nSubtype II:  Neutral Lipid Storage Disease with Ichthyosis (NLSD-I), or Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome, is caused by a mutation in the CGI-58 protein. CGI-58 is a coactivator of ATGL, and together these proteins sustain blood lipid levels between meals.[2][8]  Disruption of CGI-58 gives rise to the symptoms of ichthyosis, a dermatological condition in which skin becomes very scaly, thick and dry.[citation needed]\nIchthyosis is an inherited disorder, like NLSD, and has been found to be genetically linked in some situations with the PNPLA2 gene. Therefore, sometimes when there is a mutation in the PNPLA2 gene, the linked allele of CG-58 is mutated as well.[citation needed] This specific gene, however, does not produce ichthyosis on its own. Ichthyosis can be diagnosed individually in a patient and the genetic cause for unlinked ichthyosis is different from the gene linked with PNPLA2. Keep in mind these disorders may occur individually within a patient as well.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "Main physical signs include a fatty liver, a weakened and enlarged heart (cardiomyopathy), inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), reduced thyroid activity (hypothyroidism), type 2 diabetes, abnormal levels of creatine kinase in blood, and increased weakness of proximal muscles due to fatty replacement of skeletal muscle fibers. Accurate diagnosis is complicated by symptomatic overlap with other disorders. One of the earliest symptoms to manifest clinically is peripheral limb weakness, which becomes progressively more severe over time.[9] Specifically, asymmetric right shoulder weakness is an idiosyncratic hallmark of NLSD enabling it to be distinguished from myopathies arising from alternative muscular disorders.[9]\nNLSD is often diagnosed by the presence of lipid inclusions within leukocytes (Jordans' anomaly),[9] which can be detected using histology and electron microscopy.[2]\nClassically, NLSD is associated with myopathy and can, in some cases, be linked with ichthyosis. Therefore, with these symptoms or diagnosis, it is likely that the patient could and would be diagnosed with NLSD.[10]\nAlthough lipid accumulation is most prominent in myocytes, hepatocytes, and granulocytes, other tissues displayed elevated deposits as well. For the purpose of diagnosis, MRIs have been used to identify large fat deposits within muscle tissue.[9]\nPeople can live with NLSD, but there can be complications due to the effects this disease has on other major parts of the body like the liver, the heart, and skeletal muscle, although myopathy won't necessarily show up until a patient is in the third decade of their life,[11] a child born with ichthyosis, is immediately evaluated for NLSD, in which it is detected very early on. Also, the earlier that NLSD can be detected and symptoms treated, the better quality of life the patient can have.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Although there is no current treatment to correct the abnormal metabolic processes underlying this disease, there are approaches to ameliorate symptoms and decrease the effects of this disease. Because there is an increase of fat storage and a decrease in fat catabolism, low fat diets are recommended for slowing the progression of the disease, including the onset of type 2 diabetes and hypothyroidism. In addition, diets containing triglycerides composed of short chain fatty acids are more beneficial than TGAs containing long chain fatty acids. Ketone bodies can be rapidly transported, catabolized, and used by many tissues including the brain. Medium-chain fatty acids in an individual's diet are rapidly used by the body, limiting storage and therefore alleviating lipid droplet accumulation. Foods with medium-chain fatty acids include dairy, fat and coconut oil. Supplements can also be taken to increase uptake of these fatty acids. Triaheptanoin, a triglyceride containing three seven-carbon chain fatty acids, has also been proposed as a possible dietary supplement.[12] Treatment for the ichthyosis is limited; moisturizers are commonly used to help manage dry, flaky, itchy skin.[citation needed]",
    "Epidemiology": "The rarity and likely under-diagnosis of neutral lipid storage disease prevents an accurate epidemiological estimate of its frequency in human populations. Fewer than 100 cases of NLSD have been reported  since the first case of two women with nonbullous ichthyosiform erythroderma was reported in 1974 by Maurice Dorfman.[2] Many (but not all) of the cases reported since 1974 were in individuals of Middle Eastern descent.  A possible reason for the elevated rates of occurrence may be the higher frequency of consanguineous marriages in these populations, as opposed to an elevated frequency of carriers.[13] Males and females are equally likely to be diagnosed with the disease. Genetic testing in families with a history of this disorder may be recommended.[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "NGLY1 deficiency",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Four common findings have been identified in a majority of patients: developmental delay or intellectual disability of varying degrees, lack of or greatly reduced tears, elevated liver transaminases, and a complex movement disorder. The elevated liver enzymes often resolve in childhood. In addition, approximately 50% of patients described with NGLY1 deficiency have seizures, which can vary in their difficulty to control. Other symptoms that have been reported in affected individuals include sleep apnea, constipation, scoliosis, oral motor defects, auditory neuropathy and peripheral neuropathy.[2]",
    "Diagnosis": "NGLY1 deficiency can be suspected based on clinical findings, however confirmation of the diagnosis requires the identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in NGLY1 through genetic testing.  Traditional screening tests utilized for congenital disorders of glycosylation, including carbohydrate deficient transferrin are not diagnostic in NGLY1 deficiency.  To date all variants identified as being causative of NGLY1 deficiency have been sequence variants, rather than copy number variants.  This spectrum may change as additional cases are identified.[2]  A common nonsense variant (c.1201A>T (p.Arg401Ter)) accounts for approximately a third of pathogenic variants identified, and is associated with a more severe clinical course.[2]\nThere is also a biomarker for NGLY1 deficiency.[5][6] When the NGLY1 protein is missing or not functioning correctly, a specific molecule called GlcNAc-Asn (GNA) accumulates. GNA is elevated in individuals with NGLY1 deficiency compared to individuals without the disease.[6][5] Elevated GNA alone is not enough to confirm an NGLY1 deficiency diagnosis, but in combination with molecular genetic testing and clinical findings, it can provides additional support for NGLY1 deficiency.",
    "Treatment": "There is no cure for NGLY1 deficiency.[7]  Supportive care is indicated for each patient based on their specific symptoms, and can include eye drops to manage the alacrima, pharmaceutical management of seizures, feeding therapy and physical therapy.[2]  Most potential treatment options for NGLY1 deficiency are in the pre-clinical stages. These include enzyme replacement therapy, as well as ENGase inhibitors.[2]",
    "Epidemiology": "Forty-seven patients with confirmed NGLY1 deficiency have been reported in the medical literature.[8]  The Grace Science Foundation, a patient advocacy group, has identified approximately 150 world-wide. Currently, the majority of individuals reported with NGLY1 deficiency are of northern European descent, however this likely reflects an ascertainment bias in these early stages of the disorder.  Affected individuals with African and Hispanic backgrounds have been identified.[2]"

    "Disease": "Niemann%E2%80%93Pick disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Symptoms are related to the organs in which sphingomyelin accumulates. Enlargement of the liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly) may cause reduced appetite, abdominal distension, and pain. Enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) may also cause low levels of platelets in the blood (thrombocytopenia).[citation needed]\nAccumulation of sphingomyelin in the central nervous system (including the cerebellum) results in unsteady gait (ataxia), slurring of speech (dysarthria), and difficulty swallowing (dysphagia). Basal ganglia dysfunction causes abnormal posturing of the limbs, trunk, and face (dystonia). Upper brainstem disease results in impaired voluntary rapid eye movements (supranuclear gaze palsy). More widespread disease involving the cerebral cortex and subcortical structures causes gradual loss of intellectual abilities, causing dementia and seizures.[citation needed]\nBones also may be affected, with the disease-causing enlarged bone marrow cavities, thinned cortical bone, or a distortion of the hip bone called coxa vara. Sleep-related disorders also occur with the condition, such as sleep inversion, sleepiness during the day and wakefulness at night. Gelastic cataplexy, the sudden loss of muscle tone when the affected patient laughs, is also seen.[citation needed]",
    "Causes": "Mutations in the SMPD1 gene cause Niemann–Pick disease types A and B. They produce a deficiency in the activity of the lysosomal enzyme acid sphingomyelinase, that breaks down the lipid sphingomyelin.[3]\nMutations in NPC1 or NPC2 cause Niemann–Pick disease, type C (NPC), which affects a protein used to transport lipids.[3]\nType D originally was separated from type C to delineate a group of patients with otherwise identical disorders who shared a common Nova Scotian ancestry. Patients in this group are known to share a specific mutation in the NPC1 gene, so NPC is used for both groups. Before the molecular defects were described, the terms \"Niemann–Pick type I\" and \"Niemann–Pick type II\" were proposed to separate the high- and low-sphingomyelin forms of the disease in the early 1980s.[citation needed]\nNiemann–Pick disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern,[4][5] which means both copies or both alleles of the gene, must be defective to cause the disease. \"Defective\" means they are altered in a way that impairs their function. Most often, the parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are carriers: they have one copy of the altered gene but are not affected because the other copy produces the enzyme. If both parents are carriers, each pregnancy has a 25% chance of producing an affected child. Genetic counseling and genetic testing are recommended for families who may be carriers of the disease.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "For types A and B, levels of sphingomyelinase can be measured from a blood sample. To diagnose type C, a skin sample can help determine whether the transporter is affected via the Filipin test which detects build-up of unesterified cholesterol via fluorescent staining.[6][7]\nThe four types of Niemann–Pick disease are divided into categories. People with ASM deficiency are classified into types A and B. Type A patients exhibit hepatosplenomegaly in infancy and profound central nervous system involvement and are unable to survive beyond two years of age. Type B patients also show hepatosplenomegaly and pathologic alterations of their lungs, but usually without the involvement of their central nervous system. Some can develop significant life-threatening complications, including liver failure, hemorrhage, oxygen dependency, pulmonary infections, and splenic rupture. Some develop coronary arterial or valvular heart disease. In a longitudinal natural history study, nearly 20% of the patients died. For those classified into type C, they may have mild hepatosplenomegaly, but their central nervous system is profoundly affected.[8]\nNiemann–Pick disease type D (or Nova Scotia form) is now believed to be the same condition as Niemann–Pick disease type C.[10] Two poorly characterized forms of Niemann–Pick disease have also been described as types E and F.[11]",
    "Treatment": "In adults with type B, physicians try to keep cholesterol levels down to normal levels. If the spleen is enlarged and platelet levels low, acute episodes of bleeding may require transfusions of blood products. If they have symptoms of interstitial lung disease, they may need oxygen.[12]\nPossible treatments include enzyme replacement therapy and gene therapy. Bone marrow transplant has been tried for type B.[8]\nIn January 2009, miglustat (Zavesca) was authorized in the European Union for the treatment of progressive neurological manifestations in people with Niemann-Pick type C disease.[13][14] The medication is available to people in the United States on an experimental basis. In March 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requested additional pre-clinical and clinical information regarding miglustat from Actelion before making a final decision on approving it in the United States for Niemann-Pick type C disease.[15]\nOlipudase alfa (Xenpozyme) was approved for medical use in Japan in March 2022.[16]\nArimoclomol (Miplyffa) was approved for medical use in the United States in September 2024.[17] It is the first medication approved by the FDA to treat Niemann-Pick Disease, Type C.[17]\nLevacetylleucine (Aqneursa) was approved for medical use in the United States in September 2024.[18] Levacetylleucine is the second medication approved by the FDA for the treatment of Niemann-Pick disease type C.[18]",
    "Prognosis": "Highly variable, infantile neurovisceral Niemann–Pick disease (type A ASMD) is usually fatal before 3 years of age. In Type B, severity is highly variable, and many patients live well into adulthood and may reach a normal lifespan. Diagnoses have been made in the 7th decade of life.[19][20][21]\nType C is an entirely different disorder, which also has a highly variable prognosis.[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "Niemann%E2%80%93Pick disease type C",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Niemann–Pick type C disease has a wide clinical spectrum. Affected individuals may have enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) and liver (hepatomegaly), or enlarged spleen or liver combined (hepatosplenomegaly), but this finding may be absent in later onset cases. Prolonged jaundice or elevated bilirubin can present at birth. In some cases, however, enlargement of the spleen or liver does not occur for months or years – or not at all. Enlargement of the spleen or liver frequently becomes less apparent with time, in contrast to the progression of other lysosomal storage diseases such as Niemann–Pick disease, Types A and B or Gaucher disease. Organ enlargement does not usually cause major complications.[citation needed]\nProgressive neurological disease is the hallmark of Niemann–Pick type C disease, and is responsible for disability and premature death in all cases beyond early childhood.[5] Classically, children with NPC may initially present with delays in reaching normal developmental milestones skills before manifesting cognitive decline (dementia).[citation needed]\nNeurological signs and symptoms include cerebellar ataxia (unsteady walking with uncoordinated limb movements), dysarthria (slurred speech), dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing), tremor, epilepsy (both partial and generalized), vertical supranuclear palsy (upgaze palsy, downgaze palsy, saccadic palsy or paralysis), sleep inversion, gelastic cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone or drop attacks), dystonia (abnormal movements or postures caused by contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles across joints), most commonly begins with inturning of one foot when walking (action dystonia) and may spread to become generalized, spasticity (velocity dependent increase in muscle tone), hypotonia, ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid), microcephaly (abnormally small head), psychosis, progressive dementia, progressive hearing loss, bipolar disorder, major and psychotic depression that can include hallucinations, delusions, mutism, or stupor.[citation needed]\nIn the terminal stages of Niemann–Pick type C disease, the patient is bedridden, with complete ophthalmoplegia, loss of volitional movement and severe dementia.",
    "Diagnosis": "Niemann–Pick type C is diagnosed by assaying cultured fibroblasts for cholesterol esterification and staining for unesterified cholesterol with filipin. The fibroblasts are grown from a small skin biopsy taken from a patient with suspected NPC. The diagnosis can be confirmed by identifying mutations in the NPC1 or NPC2 genes in 80–90% of cases. This specialized testing is available at Thomas Jefferson University Lysosomal Disease Testing Lab[18] and the Mayo Clinic.[19]",
    "Treatment": "In April 2009, hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPbCD) was approved under compassionate use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat Addison and Cassidy Hempel,[27] identical twin girls who had Niemann–Pick type C disease. Medi-ports, similar to ports used to administer chemotherapy drugs, were surgically placed into the twins' chest walls and allow doctors to directly infuse HPbCD into their bloodstreams. Treatment with cyclodextrin has been shown to delay clinical disease onset, reduced intraneuronal storage and secondary markers of neurodegeneration, and significantly increased lifespan in both the Niemann–Pick type C mice[28] and feline[29] models. This is the second time in the United States that cyclodextrin alone has been administered in an attempt to treat a fatal pediatric disease. In 1987, HPbCD was used in a medical case involving a boy with severe hypervitaminosis A.[30]\nIn May 2010, the FDA granted hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin orphan drug status and designated HPbCD cyclodextrin as a potential treatment for Niemann–Pick type C disease. In July 2010, Dr. Caroline Hastings of UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland filed additional applications with the FDA requesting approval to deliver HPbCD directly into the central nervous systems of the twins in an attempt to help HPbCD cross the blood–brain barrier. The request was approved by the FDA in September 2010, and bi-monthly intrathecal injections of HPbCD into the spine were administered starting in October 2010.[citation needed]\nIn December 2010, the FDA granted approval for HPbCD to be delivered via IV to an additional patient, Peyton Hadley, aged 13, under an IND with Dr. Diane Williams, through Asante Rogue Regional Medical Center in Medford, Oregon. Soon after in March 2011, approval was sought for similar treatment of his sibling, Kayla, age 11, and infusions of HPbCD began shortly after. Both began intrathecal treatments beginning January 2012.  In 2014 Peyton had an intrathecal smart port placed by OHSU's neurosurgeon Dr. Lissa Baird, to alleviate sedation during the intrathecal procedures.  It was successful and continues to be used for treatment (currently 2023). They continue in 2023 to receive both IV and IT treatments; 8 hour IV from home twice monthly, and IT twice monthly at Asante Rogue Regional Medical Center, rotating with IV and IT every week.  These patients have proven safety and benefit shown by NIH Severity Scale Assessments, one slightly less impacted than projected and the other with a profound impact and benefit than projected.[31]\nIn April 2011, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), in collaboration with the Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases Program (TRND), announced they were developing a clinical trial utilizing cyclodextrin for Niemann–Pick type C patients.[citation needed]\nIn September 2011, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted HPbCD orphan drug status and designated the compound as a potential treatment for Niemann–Pick type C disease.[citation needed]\nIn December 2011, the FDA granted approval for IV HPbCD infusions for a fifth child in the United States, Chase DiGiovanni, under a compassionate use protocol. The child was 29 months old at the time of his first intravenous infusion, which was started in January 2012.[32]\nDue to unprecedented collaboration between individual physicians and parents of children affected by NPC, approximately 15 patients worldwide have received HPbCD cyclodextrin therapy under compassionate use treatment protocols. Treatment involves a combination of intravenous therapy (IV), intrathecal therapy (IT) and intracerebroventricular (ICV) cyclodextrin therapy.[citation needed]\nIn January 2013, a formal clinical trial to evaluate HPβCD cyclodextrin therapy as a treatment for Niemann–Pick disease, type C was announced by scientists from the NIH's National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD).[citation needed]\nIn January 2021, Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals concluded that the benefit / risk balance for HPβCD cyclodextrin (adrabetadex) for the treatment of neurologic symptoms of NPC was negative, and that the risks associated with the treatment outweigh the potential benefit. Effective immediately, Mallinckrodt recommended that treatment with adrabetadex be discontinued as soon as possible, with the appropriate physician oversight.[33]\nOne drug that has been tried is Miglustat.[34][35] Miglustat is a glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor, which inhibits the synthesis of glycosphingolipids in cells. It has been shown to delay the onset of disease in the NPC mouse, and published data from a multi-center clinical trial of Miglustat in the United States and England and from case reports suggests that it may ameliorate the course of human NPC.[citation needed]\nSeveral other treatment strategies are under investigation in cell culture and animal models of NPC. These include, cholesterol mobilization, neurosteroid (a special type of hormone that affects brain and other nerve cells) replacement using allopregnanolone,[6][36] rab overexpression to bypass the trafficking block (Pagano lab) and Curcumin as an anti-inflammatory and calcium modulatory agent.[17] The pregnane X receptor has been identified as a potential target.[37]\nNeural stem cells have also been investigated in an animal model, and clear evidence of life extension in the mouse model has been shown.[38]\nLow cholesterol diets are often used,[39] but there is no evidence of efficacy.[40]\nGene therapy is being used clinically to treat genetic diseases including haemophilia[41] and spinal muscular atrophy.[42] It has been used preclinically, in a mouse model of Niemann-Pick type C, using an adeno-associated virus derived viral vector has been shown to extend lifespan following injection into the lateral ventricles of the neonatal brain.[43] In a separate proof-of-concept study a similar vector, but with a modified capsid capable of delivering genes to the central nervous system following intravenous injection, was given to Niemann-Pick type C mice at around four weeks of age; this resulted in extended lifespan and improved weight gain.[44]",
    "Prognosis": "The lifespan of patients with NPC is usually related to the age of onset. Children with antenatal or infantile onset usually succumb in the first few months or years of life, whereas adolescent and adult onset forms of Niemann–Pick type C have a more insidious onset and slower progression, and affected individuals may survive to the seventh decade. Adult cases of NPC are being recognized with increasing frequency. It is suspected that many patients affected by NPC are undiagnosed, owing to lack of awareness of the disease and the absence of readily available screening or diagnostic tests. For the same reasons the diagnosis is often delayed by many years.[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "Nodding disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Children affected by nodding disease experience a complete and permanent stunting of growth. The growth of the brain is also stunted, leading to intellectual disability. The disease is named for the characteristic, pathological nodding seizure, which often begins with the sight of food or dropping temperatures.[2][6] These seizures are brief and halt after the children stop eating or when they feel warm again. Seizures in nodding disease span a wide range of severity. Neurotoxicologist Peter Spencer, who has investigated the disease, has stated that upon presentation with food, \"one or two [children] will start nodding very rapidly in a continuous, pendulous nod. A nearby child may suddenly go into a tonic–clonic seizure, while others will freeze.\"[7] Severe seizures can cause the child to collapse, causing injury.[8] Sub-clinical seizures have been identified in electroencephalograms, and MRI scans have shown brain atrophy and damage to the hippocampus and glia cells.[4]\nIt has been found that no seizures occur when affected individuals are given an unfamiliar or non-traditional food, such as chocolate.[6][8][9]",
    "Causes": "As of 2024[update] the cause of the disease was not known,[2] but a link has been found between nodding syndrome, infestation by the parasitic worm Onchocerca volvulus prevalent in all outbreak areas, and exposure to black-fly bites which transmit it.[10][2] A possible explanation involves the formation of antibodies against parasite antigen that are cross-reactive to leiomodin-1 in the central nervous system.[11] O. volvulus, a nematode, is carried by the black fly and causes river blindness. In 2004, most children with nodding disease lived close to the Yei River, a hotbed for river blindness, and 93.7% of those with nodding disease were found to harbour the parasite — a far higher percentage than in children without the disease.[12] A link between river blindness and normal cases of epilepsy,[13] as well as retarded growth,[14] had been proposed previously, although the evidence for this link is inconclusive.[15] Of the connection between the worm and the disease, Scott Dowell, the lead investigator into the syndrome for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), stated: \"We know that [Onchocerca volvulus] is involved in some way, but it is a little puzzling because [the worm] is fairly common in areas that do not have nodding disease\".[10] Andrea Winkler, the first author of a 2008 Tanzanian study, has said of the connection: \"We could not establish any hint that Onchocerca volvulus is actually going into the brain, but what we cannot exclude is that there is an autoimmune mechanism going on.\"[4] In the most severely affected region of Uganda, infection with microfilariae in epileptic or nodding children ranged from 70% to 100%.[16]\nIn 2011 the CDC was investigating a possible connection with wartime chemical exposure, and whether a deficiency in vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) could be a cause, noting the seizures of pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy and this common deficiency in those with the disease.[4] Older theories include a 2002 toxicology report that postulated a connection with tainted monkey meat, as well as the eating of agricultural seeds provided by relief agencies that were covered in toxic chemicals.[6]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is not very advanced and is based on the telltale nodding seizures of the patients. When stunted growth and mental disability are also present, probability of nodding syndrome is high. In the future, neurological scans may also be used in diagnosis.[17]",
    "Treatment": "As of 2024[update] no cure was known for the disease,[2] so treatment has been directed at symptoms, and has included the use of anticonvulsants used to treat epilepsy such as sodium valproate[10] and phenobarbitol. Anti-malaria drugs have also been administered, to unknown effect.[7] Nutritional deficiencies may also be present.",
    "Prognosis": "Nodding syndrome is debilitating both physically and mentally. In 2004, Peter Spencer stated: \"It is, by all reports, a progressive disorder and a fatal disorder, perhaps with a duration of about three years or more.\"[7] Without epilepsy drugs, the condition worsens; seizures can cause accidents[9] and even death. Long-term effects include brain damage, stunted growth and mental impairment.[2] A few children are said to have recovered from the disease, but many have died.[6]",
    "Epidemiology": "While the majority of occurrences of the disease known as \"nodding syndrome\" have been relatively recent, it appears that the condition was first documented in 1962 in southern Tanzania.[4] More recently, nodding syndrome had become most prevalent in South Sudan, where in 2003 approximately 300 cases were found in Mundri alone. By 2009, it had spread across the border to Uganda's Kitgum district,[3] and the Ugandan ministry of health declared that more than 2000 children had the disease.[4] As of the end of 2011, outbreaks were concentrated in Kitgum, Pader and Gulu. More than 1000 cases were diagnosed in the last half of that year.[10]\nThere were further outbreaks in early 2012, in South Sudan, Uganda, and Tanzania.[18] In the five years to 2024 cases have been identified in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic and Cameroon.[2]\nThe spread and manifestation of outbreaks may further be exacerbated due to the poor availability of health care in the region.[7]"

    "Disease": "Non-24-hour sleep%E2%80%93wake disorder",
    "Causes": "The possible causes of non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder are 2-fold: (1), extrinsic: isolation from daily light cycles (such as working in an environment completely devoid of natural lighting);[citation needed] and (2), intrinsic: where some condition, such as blindness or malfunctioning biochemical response to light in the subject, prevent normal levels of light-activated melatonin release.[citation needed] Melatonin is responsible for sleep regulation, and its release is controlled by the amount of light entering the eyes.[16]\nSighted people with non-24 appear to be more rare than blind people with the disorder, and the etiology of their circadian disorder is less well understood.[17] At least one case of a sighted person developing non-24 was preceded by head injury;[18] another patient diagnosed with the disorder was later found to have a \"large pituitary adenoma that involved the optic chiasma\".[3] Thus the problem appears to be neurological. Specifically, it is thought to involve abnormal functioning of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus.[19] Several other cases have been preceded by chronotherapy, a prescribed treatment for delayed sleep phase disorder.[17] \"Studies in animals suggest that a hypernyctohemeral syndrome could occur as a physiologic aftereffect of lengthening the sleep–wake cycle with chronotherapy\".[7] According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), \"patients with free-running (FRD) rhythms are thought to reflect a failure of entrainment\".[20]\nThere have been several experimental studies of sighted people with the disorder. McArthur et al. reported treating a sighted patient who \"appeared to be subsensitive to bright light\".[21] In other words, the brain (or the retina) does not react normally to light (people with the disorder may or may not, however, be unusually subjectively sensitive to light; one study found that they were more sensitive than the control group[6]). In 2002 Uchiyama et al. examined five sighted non-24 patients who showed, during the study, a sleep–wake cycle averaging 25.12 hours.[22] That is appreciably longer than the 24.02-hour average shown by the control subjects in that study, which was near the average innate cycle for healthy adults of all ages: the 24.18 hours found by Charles Czeisler.[23] The literature usually refers to a \"one- to two-hour\" delay per 24-hour day (i.e. a 25- to 26-hour cycle).[citation needed]\nUchiyama et al. had earlier determined that sighted non-24 patients' minimum core body temperature occurs much earlier in the sleep episode than the normal two hours before awakening. They suggest that the long interval between the temperature trough and awakening makes illumination upon awakening virtually ineffective,[24] as per the phase response curve (PRC) for light.\nIn their clinical review in 2007, Okawa and Uchiyama reported that people with non-24 have a mean habitual sleep duration of nine to ten hours and that their circadian periods average 24.8 hours.[6]\nAs stated above, the majority of patients with non-24 are totally blind. The failure of entrainment is explained by the loss of photic input to the circadian clock. Non-24 is rare among visually impaired patients who retain at least some light perception; even minimal light exposure can synchronize the body clock.[11] A few cases have been described in which patients are subjectively blind, but are normally entrained and have an intact response to the suppressing effects of light on melatonin secretion, indicating preserved neural pathways between the retina and hypothalamus.[25][26]",
    "Diagnosis": "This disorder can have symptomatic periods, where \"the time of high sleep propensity gradually shifts, such that patients experience daytime hypersomnolence and nighttime insomnia\".[2]\nIn sighted people, the diagnosis is typically made based on a history of persistently delayed sleep onset that follows a non-24-hour pattern. Hayakawa et al. (2005) reported on the basis of 57 cases of sighted patients that the average day length was 24.9 ± 0.4 hours (with the range of 24.4–26.5).[33][34]",
    "Treatment": "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved in January 2014 the melatonin agonist tasimelteon for the treatment of non-24 for blind people. This is the first FDA-approved drug for any circadian rhythm sleep disorder, since melatonin is unregulated. In the largest treatment study with non-24 patients, it was demonstrated that tasimelteon safely and effectively treated totally blind patients: entrainment occurred in 20% (8 of 40) of patients receiving the drug compared with 3% (1 of 38) receiving placebo. In a separate meta-analysis, melatonin supplementation achieved a 67% (12 of 18) entrainment rate. Studies directly comparing tasimelteon and melatonin have yet to be performed. Study authors noted that the lower rates of entrainment with tasimelteon may have been due to short duration of treatment.[2]",
    "Epidemiology": "There are an estimated 140,000 people with non-24—both sighted and blind—in the European Union, a total prevalence of approximately 3 per 10,000, or 0.03%.[44] It is unknown how many individuals with this disorder do not seek medical attention, so incidence may be higher. The European portal for rare diseases, Orphanet, lists non-24 as a rare disease by their definition: fewer than 1 affected person for every 2000 population.[31]  The US National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) lists non-24 as a rare disease by its definition.[45]\nWhile both sighted and blind people are diagnosed with non-24, the disorder is believed to affect up to 70% of totally blind individuals.[2] It is estimated by researchers that of the 1.3 million blind people in the U.S.,[46] 10% have no light perception at all.[25] Of that group, it is estimated that approximately half to three-quarters, or 65,000 to 95,000 Americans, have non-24.[9]",
    "Society and culture": "NASA explored the potential impact on circadian rhythm and possible development of a sleep–wake disorder by human astronauts who would go on a mission to Mars, by assessing mission personnel who worked remotely on the Phoenix Mars Lander project and were asked to follow a Mars day of 24.65 hours for 78 days.[28][29]"

    "Disease": "Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy",
    "Signs and symptoms": "In terms of the signs (and symptoms) of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy would be consistent with the following:[2][6]\nThough the aforementioned signs/symptoms are the most common, there have been cases though rare, where the peripheral nervous system has had involvement with significant reduction of myelinated fibers [2]\nIn homozygous cases, this muscular dystrophy is severe and starts earlier in the affected individual's life.[6]",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy can be done via two methods, a muscle biopsy or a blood draw with genetic testing for GCG trinucleotide expansions in the PABPN1 gene. Genetic blood testing is more common. Additionally, a distinction between OPMD and myasthenia gravis or mitochondrial myopathy must be made, in regards to the differential diagnosis of this condition.[2]",
    "Treatment": "Currently, no cure or specific treatment exists to eliminate the symptoms or stop the disease progression. A consistent diet planned with the help of a dietitian along with exercises taught by a speech therapist can assist with mild symptoms of dysphagia. Surgical intervention can also help temporarily manage symptoms related to ptosis and dysphagia. Cutting one of the throat muscles internally, an operation called cricopharyngeal myotomy, can be one way to ease symptoms in more severe cases. However, for most people, the benefits from such treatments are only temporary. There is currently no treatment available to address the proximal limb weakness. Many of those affected with proximal limb weakness will eventually require assistive devices such as canes, braces, or a wheelchair. As with all surgical procedures, they come with many risk factors.[9][10] As the dysphagia becomes more severe, patients become malnourished, lose significant weight, become dehydrated and suffer from repeated incidents of aspiration pneumonia. These last two are often the cause of death.[11]",
    "Epidemiology": "The disease is found across 5 continents (30 countries) and is frequently seen in French Canadians, with a prevalence 1:1000. OPMD affects males and females equally, and affected individuals have been found in Europe (France), Jewish Bukharan, and Spanish Americans.[12]"

  {
    "Disease": "Ollier disease",
    "Causes": "For many years, most research has been inconclusive regarding the cause of the disease.[1][17]\nRecent studies have shown that most cases of Ollier disease are believed to have been caused by isocitrate dehydrogenases IDH1 and IDH2 mutations.[18] In one study, 35 of 43 (81%) patients with Ollier disease had either a IDH1 or IDH2 mutation.[19] Another study suggests that R132C IDH1 mutations which are particularly dominant at exon 4 of IDH genes are linked to the growth of vascular lesions.[15] Isocitrate deyhydrogenases IDH1 and IDH2 are catalysts responsible for the conversion of isocitrate to 2-oxoglutarate. The isocitrate deyhydrogenases IDH1 and IDH2 mutations disrupt this process resulting in unregulated production of α-ketoglutarate and a reduction in chondrocyte proliferation. In many cases of cartilaginous tumors, IDH1 and IDH2 point mutations were found thus explaining why Ollier disease is associated with many different associated conditions. Based on these case studies, most evidence suggests that the abnormal lining of lesions found in Ollier disease would suggest that the condition is caused by a post-zygotic somatic mutation thus resulting in a mosaic genetic disorder.[20]\nApproximately 8–10% of cases of patients with Ollier disease have been linked to PTH1R mutations.[17][19] A particular case study the mutant heterozygous PTHR1 (R150C) receptor was observed in two unrelated patients with Ollier disease.[21][22] This PTHR1 (R150C) mutant causes a reduction in chondrocyte differentiation by triggering the PTHrP-dependent pathway and decreasing PTHLH receptor function by approximately 30% creating enchondromas. One of these patients with the PTHR1 (R150C) mutant was found to have inherited the mutation from his father. This provides credence to the theory that multiple genetic mutations are needed to occur in order for Ollier disease to manifest.\nAn alternative theory suggests that since there have been cases of multiple family members with enchondromatosis, the disorder may be passed on through autosomal dominant inheritance.[1]",
    "Diagnosis": "Clinical and radiological evaluations are conducted in order to detect the presence of bone neoplasms or lesions typically found in Ollier disease. Histological evaluations are mainly used to examine or detect malignancies.\nAbnormal bone growth such as shortening or thickening and deformity may be observed in patients of Ollier disease. These bone lesions are visible at birth using radiography but are usually not screened or examined for until clinical manifestations present during early childhood.  However, some patients may exhibit no signs of any symptoms.[1] One study found thirteen to be the mean age of diagnosis in patients with Ollier disease. In an X-ray, there would normally be the presence of several homogeneous lesions of an oval or elongated shape with bone edges that are slightly thickened.[3] With age, these lesions may calcify and appear as diffusely minute spots or stippled. Fan-like septations or streaks would be indicative of the presence of several enchondromas. Early detection and consistent and repeated monitoring is important in order to prevent and treat any potential bone neoplasms.[citation needed]\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, and scintigraphy are generally not practical for diagnostic purposes. X-rays are not as effective in the monitoring or evaluation of enchondromas due to frequent localized changes also sometimes due to the large number of enchondromas. MRI can sometimes however be used to monitor and evaluate symptomatic lesions in the case of potential malignant transformations.\nSimilar disorders such as Maffucci syndrome and hereditary multiple exostoses (HME) require differentiation during diagnosis. Maffucci syndrome can be distinguished clinically by the presence of hemangiomas and lymphangiomas and genetically through R132C IDH1 hotspot mutations.[15] HME features osteochondromas which are near the surface the bone whereas enchondromas featured in Ollier disease and Maffucci are more towards the center of the bone.[3] Also, neural compressions are more commonly found in HME than in Ollier disease.",
    "Treatment": "The condition of Ollier disease cannot be treated for but the complications that arise such as fractures, growth defects, and tumors can be surgically treated. These are typically done to treat and remove any extraneous bone tissue while preserving the function of limb if possible.[11]\nFractures have been treated using a variety of methods such as bone grafting, internal fixation, corticoplasty, Ilizarov technique, elastic stable intramedullary nailing system (ESIN), and flexible intramedullary nailing (FIN).\nCorticoplasty has been shown to have success in treating hand lesions and deformities while retaining normal function.[23][24] The surgery utilizes the removal of tissue (curettage) and bone reconstruction in order to remove enchondromas and improve cosmetic appearance. Many cases of corticoplasty have been shown improvement in appearances while maintaining function. Recurrence of enchondromas was observed in some cases. In cases of Ollier disease, early surgical treatment of enchondromas in the hand is recommended.\nThe Ilizarov technique is a form of noninvasive treatment that can sometimes be used to reshape and correct deformities and misaligned limb bones.[25][26] It uses the process of external fixation through the scaffolding of pins or wires into the bone in an attempt to transform enchondromata into normal bone tissue. This method of treatment is very safe but is also very strenuous as it a long-term procedure. The ring fixators used in the Ilizarov technique have been shown to be very versatile for realigning and lengthening limb bones while also managing soft tissue tension.[27] Complications from this procedure may include a recurrence in limb lengthening complications such as premature healing requiring osteoclasis and a return of angular deformities. Reduced latency periods followed by faster distraction times are encouraged in order to prevent premature healing. The Ilizarov technique has shown to have positive outcomes for many cases of Ollier disease with some patients even experiencing full correction of deformity and length in best cases scenarios.\nElastic stable intramedullary nailing system (ESIN) and flexible intramedullary nailing (FIN) are more recent surgical procedures that utilize internal fixation that has been shown to reduce the Healing Index and minimize complications.[28][29] Similarly to the Ilizarov technique, the procedure is intended to correct deformities and elongate limb bones. This form of treatment is not suitable for the elongation of bones with a small shaft diameter or sections containing open growth zones. Patients with severe forms of Ollier disease also are not suited for surgery because of an increased risk of complications due to bone frame instability. Both the elastic stable intramedullary nailing system (ESIN) and flexible intramedullary nailing (FIN) use two bent elastic nails in order to allow for greater realignment and stability. This technique used in conjunction with a circular external fixator has been shown to significantly reduce Healing Index values in both monosegmental and polysegmental lengthening. Another advantage is that no fractures or deformities were found in later follow ups of 2 to 5 years.\nElastic stable intramedullary nailing system (ESIN) requires a longer duration of external fixation for most procedures compared to flexible intramedullary nailing (FIN).[citation needed]\nMalignant transformations of any or multiple enchondromas are common in patients with Ollier disease and typically emerge in young adults often requiring surgery. The average age of patients of Ollier disease for their first surgery to treat their chondrosarcoma is thirty-three. Some examples of surgical procedures performed to treat secondary malignant bone neoplasms from Ollier disease include amputation, wide-local excisions, hemipelvectomy, and arthroplasty.[30] Cobalt and chemotherapy are typically not primary methods of surgery as chondrosarcomas generally do not have enough blood supply to make it an effective form of treatment.[31] These are done to treat and remove any extraneous bone tissue while preserving the function of limb if possible.[11]",
    "Epidemiology": "One out of every 100,000 people is estimated to have Ollier disease. However, this estimate may be low due to under reporting of cases from asymptomatic or mild conditions.[17] There are many contradicting studies that report different prevalence rates between genders as one study indicates that it affects both sexes equally while other studies purporting that it affects men or women more frequently.[17][8][20] The average age of diagnosis is 13 years. Ollier disease is not normally diagnosed until early childhood due to lack of visible symptoms present at birth despite lesions being present using radiography. Although most research suggests that Ollier disease is spontaneous and nonhereditary, there are some cases where it appears among family members."

    "Disease": "Opitz G/BBB syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The three most common symptoms of Opitz G/BBB syndrome (both type I & II) are hypertelorism (exceptionally wide-spaced eyes), laryngo-tracheo-esophalgeal defects (including clefts and holes in the palate, larynx, trachea and esophagus) and hypospadias (urinary openings in males not at the tip of the penis) (Meroni, Opitz G/BBB syndrome, 2012). Abnormalities in the larynx, trachea and esophagus can cause significant difficulty breathing and/or swallowing and can result in reoccurring pneumonia and life-threatening situations. Commonly, there may be a gap between the trachea and esophagus, referred to as a laryngeal cleft; which can allow food or fluid to enter the airway and make breathing and eating a difficult task.[5]\nGenital abnormalities like a urinary opening under the penis (hypospadias), undescended testes (cryptorchidism), underdeveloped scrotum and a scrotum divided into two lobes (bifid scrotum) can all be commonplace for males with the disease.[6]\nDevelopmental delays of the brain and nervous system are also common in both types I and II of the disease.[7] 50% of people with Opitz G/BBB Syndrome will experience developmental delay and mild intellectual disability. This can impact motor skills, speech and learning capabilities. Some of these instances are likened to autistic spectrum disorders. Close to half of the people with Opitz G/BBB Syndrome also have a cleft lip (hole in the lip opening) and possibly a cleft palate (hole in the roof of the mouth), as well. Less than half of the people diagnosed have heart defects, imperforate anus (obstructed anal opening), and brain defects.[8] Of all the impairments, female carriers of X-linked Type I Opitz G/BBB Syndrome usually only have ocular hypertelorism.[9]",
    "Causes": "Opitz G/BBB Syndrome is a rare genetic condition caused by one of two major types of mutations: MID1 mutation on the short (p) arm of the X chromosome or a mutation of the 22q11.2 gene on the 22nd chromosome.[10]",
    "Diagnosis": "X-linked type I Opitz G/BBB Syndrome is diagnosed on clinical findings, but those findings can vary greatly: even within the same family. Manifestations of X-linked type I are classified in the frequent/major findings and minor findings that are found in less than 50% of individuals.[14]\nThe three major findings that suggest a person has X-linked Type I Opitz G/BBB Syndrome:\nMinor findings found in less than 50% of individuals:\n[15]\nIn 1989, Hogdall used ultrasonographs to diagnose X-linked Type I Opitz G/BBB Syndrome after 19 weeks of pregnancy, by identifying hypertelorism (widely-spaced eyes) and hypospadias (irregular urinary tract openings in the penis).[16]\nThere is also molecular genetic testing available to identify mutations leading to Opitz G/BBB Syndrome. X-linked Type I testing must be done on MID1, since this is the only gene that is known to cause Type I Opitz G/BBB Syndrome. Two different tests can be performed: sequence analysis and deletion/duplication analysis Archived 2020-10-30 at the Wayback Machine. In the sequence analysis a positive result would detect 15-50% of the DNA sequence mutated, while a deletion/duplication positive result would find deletion or duplication of one or more exons of the entire MID1 gene.[17]",
    "Treatment": "Because the variability of this disease is so great and the way that it reveals itself could be multi-faceted; once diagnosed, a multidisciplinary team is recommended to treat the disease and should include a craniofacial surgeon, ophthalmologist, pediatrician, pediatric urologist, cardiologist, pulmonologist, speech pathologist, and a medical geneticist. Several important steps must be followed, as well.[citation needed]\nMany surgical repairs may be needed, as assessed by professionals. Furthermore, special education therapies and psychoemotional therapies may be required, as well. In some cases, antireflux drugs can be prescribed until risk of breathing and swallowing disorders are removed. Genetic counseling is highly advised to help explain who else in the family may be at risk for the disease and to help guide family planning decisions in the future.[19]\nBecause of its wide variability in which defects will occur, there is no known mortality rate specifically for the disease. However, the leading cause of death for people with Opitz G/BBB syndrome is due to infant death caused by aspiration due to esophageal, pharyngeal or laryngeal defects.[20]\nFortunately, to date there are no factors that can increase the expression of symptoms of this disease. All abnormalities and symptoms are present at birth.[21]\nSince the symptoms caused by this disease are present at birth, there is no “cure.” The best cure that scientists are researching is awareness and genetic testing to determine risk factors and increase knowledgeable family planning. Prevention is the only option at this point in time for a cure."

    "Disease": "Osteochondritis dissecans",
    "Signs and symptoms": "In osteochondritis dissecans, fragments of cartilage or bone become loose within a joint, leading to pain and inflammation. These fragments are sometimes referred to as joint mice.[7] OCD is a type of osteochondrosis in which a lesion has formed within the cartilage layer itself, giving rise to secondary inflammation. OCD most commonly affects the knee, although it can affect other joints such as the ankle or the elbow.[8]\nPeople with OCD report activity-related pain that develops gradually. Individual complaints usually consist of mechanical symptoms including pain, swelling, catching, locking, popping noises, and buckling / giving way; the primary presenting symptom may be a restriction in the range of movement.[9] Symptoms typically present within the initial weeks of stage I. The onset of stage II occurs within months and offers little time for diagnosis. The disease progresses rapidly beyond stage II, as OCD lesions quickly move from stable cysts or fissures to unstable fragments. Non-specific symptoms, caused by similar injuries such as sprains and strains, can delay a definitive diagnosis.[10]\nPhysical examination typically reveals fluid in the joint, tenderness, and crepitus. The tenderness may initially spread, but often reverts to a well-defined focal point as the lesion progresses. Just as OCD shares symptoms with common maladies, acute osteochondral fracture has a similar presentation with tenderness in the affected joint, but is usually associated with a fatty hemarthrosis. Although there is no significant pathologic gait or characteristic alignment abnormality associated with OCD, the patient may walk with the involved leg externally rotated in an attempt to avoid tibial spine impingement on the lateral aspect of the medial condyle of the femur.[11]",
    "Diagnosis": "To diagnose osteochondritis dissecans, an X-ray, CT scan or MRI scan can be performed to show necrosis of subchondral bone, formation of loose fragments, or both.[30] Occasionally a nuclear medicine bone scan is used to assess the degree of loosening within the joint.[31]\nPhysical examination often begins with examination of the patient's gait. In OCD of the knee, people may walk with the involved leg externally rotated in an attempt to avoid tibial spine impingement on the lateral aspect of the medial condyle of the femur.[11]\nNext, the examining physician may check for weakness of the quadriceps. This examination may reveal fluid in the joint, tenderness, and crepitus. The Wilson test is also useful in locating OCD lesions of the femoral condyle.[32] The test is performed by slowly extending the knee from 90 degrees, maintaining internal rotation. Pain at 30 degrees of flexion and relief with tibial external rotation is indicative of OCD.[33]\nPhysical examination of a patient with ankle OCD often returns symptoms of joint effusion, crepitus, and diffuse or localized tenderness. Examination often reveals symptoms of generalized joint pain, swelling, and times with limited range of motion. Some with loose body lesions may report catching, locking, or both.[34] The possibility of microtrauma emphasizes a need for evaluation of biomechanical forces at the knee in a physical examination. As a result, the alignment and rotation of all major joints in the affected extremity is common, as are extrinsic and intrinsic abnormalities concerning the affected joint, including laxity.[35]\nX-rays show lucency of the ossification on the anterior aspect of the knee in juvenile patients. In older people, the lesion typically appears as an area of osteosclerotic bone with a radiolucent line between the osteochondral defect and the epiphysis. The visibility of the lesion depends on its location and on the amount of knee flexion used. Harding described the lateral X-ray as a method to identify the site of an OCD lesion.[36]\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful for staging OCD lesions, evaluating the integrity of the joint surface, and distinguishing normal variants of bone formation from OCD by showing bone and cartilage edema in the area of the irregularity. MRI provides information regarding features of the articular cartilage and bone under the cartilage, including edema, fractures, fluid interfaces, articular surface integrity, and fragment displacement.[37][38] A low T1 and high T2 signal at the fragment interface is seen in active lesions. This indicates an unstable lesion or recent microfractures.[30] While MRI and arthroscopy have a close correlation, X-ray films tend to be less inductive of similar MRI results.[38]\nComputed tomography (CT) scans and Technetium-99m bone scans are also sometimes used to monitor the progress of treatment. Unlike plain radiographs (X-rays), CT scans and MRI scans can show the exact location and extent of the lesion.[39] Technetium bone scans can detect regional blood flow and the amount of osseous uptake. Both of these seem to be closely correlated to the potential for healing in the fragment.[40][41]\nOCD is classified by the progression of the disease in stages.\nThere are two main staging classifications used; one is determined by MRI diagnostic imaging while the other is determined arthroscopically. Both stagings represent the pathological conditions associated with OCD's natural progression.[9]\nWhile the arthroscopic classification of bone and cartilage lesions is considered standard, the Anderson MRI staging is the main form of staging used in this article.[42] Stages I and II are stable lesions. Stages III and IV describe unstable lesions in which a lesion of the cartilage has allowed synovial fluid between the fragment and bone.",
    "Prognosis": "The prognosis after different treatments varies and is based on several factors that include the age of the patient, the affected joint, the stage of the lesion and, most importantly, the state of the growth plate.[34] It follows that the two main forms of osteochondritis dissecans are defined by skeletal maturity. The juvenile form of the disease occurs in open growth plates, usually affecting children between the ages of 5 and 15 years.[66] The adult form commonly occurs between ages 16 to 50, although it is unclear whether these adults developed the disease after skeletal maturity or were undiagnosed as children.[67]\nThe prognosis is good for stable lesions (stage I and II) in juveniles with open growth plates; treated conservatively—typically without surgery—50% of cases will heal.[68] Recovery in juveniles can be attributed to the bone's ability to repair damaged or dead bone tissue and cartilage in a process called bone remodeling. Open growth plates are characterized by increased numbers of undifferentiated chondrocytes (stem cells), which are precursors to both bone and cartilaginous tissue. As a result, open growth plates allow for more of the stem cells necessary for repair in the affected joint.[69] Unstable, large, full-thickness lesions (stage III and IV) or lesions of any stage found in the skeletally mature are more likely to fail non-operative treatment. These lesions offer a worse prognosis and surgery is required in most cases.[70][71]",
    "Epidemiology": "OCD is a relatively rare disorder, with an estimated incidence of 15 to 30 cases per 100,000 persons per year.[5] Widuchowski W et al. found OCD to be the cause of articular cartilage defects in 2% of cases in a study of 25,124 knee arthroscopies.[72] Although rare, OCD is noted as an important cause of joint pain in active adolescents. The juvenile form of the disease occurs in children with open growth plates, usually between the ages 5 and 15 years and occurs more commonly in males than females, with a ratio between 2:1 and 3:1.[8][73] OCD has become more common among adolescent females as they become more active in sports.[74] The adult form, which occurs in those who have reached skeletal maturity, is most commonly found in people 16 to 50 years old.[70]\nWhile OCD may affect any joint, the knee—specifically the medial femoral condyle in 75–85% of knee cases—tends to be the most commonly affected, and constitutes 75% of all cases.[8][75][76][77] The elbow (specifically the capitulum of the humerus) is the second most affected joint with 6% of cases; the talar dome of the ankle represents 4% of cases.[78] Less frequent locations include the patella, vertebrae, the femoral head, and the glenoid of the scapula.[79]\nThe oldest case of OCD was identified on the temporo-mandibular joint of the Qafzeh 9 fossil.[80]"

    "Disease": "Osteogenesis imperfecta",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The main symptom of osteogenesis imperfecta is fragile, low mineral density bones; all types of OI have some bone involvement.[5] In moderate and especially severe OI, the long bones may be bowed, sometimes extremely so.[28] The weakness of the bones causes them to fracture easily—a study at the Endocrine Unit at the National Institute of Child Health in Karachi, Pakistan found an average of 5.8 fractures per year in untreated children.[29] Fractures typically occur much less after puberty, but begin to increase again in women after menopause and in men between the ages of 60 and 80.[1]: 486\nJoint hypermobility is also a common sign of OI, thought to be because the affected genes are the same as those that cause some types of Ehlers–Danlos syndrome.[5]: 1513  [note 1][30][31]\nBy the age of 50, about 50% of adults with OI experience significant hearing loss, much earlier as compared to the general population.[32] Hearing loss in OI may or may not be associated with visible deformities of the ossicles and inner ear.[33] Hearing loss frequently begins during the second, third, and fourth decades of life, and may be conductive, sensorineural, or a combination of both (\"mixed\").[34] If hearing loss does not occur by age 50, it is significantly less likely to occur in the years afterwards.[32] Mixed hearing loss is most common among those with OI of all age groups, while conductive hearing loss is most likely to affect older people, with sensorineural hearing loss most likely to affect children.[35]\nAlthough relatively rare, OI-related hearing loss can also begin in childhood; in a study of forty-five children aged four to sixteen, two were found to be affected, aged 11 and 15.[36] In a different 2008 study, the hearing of 41 people with OI was checked. The results showed that 88% of those over 20 years of age had some form of hearing loss, while only 38% of those under 20 did.[37]\nHearing loss is most common in type I OI; it is less common in types III and IV.[1]: 294–296  Other parts of the inner ear may also be affected by OI. causing balance issues; however, only small studies have found links between vertigo and OI.[1]: 308  OI may worsen the outcome of medical treatments which correct hearing loss.[35]\nBesides OI's association with sensorineural hearing loss, OI is associated with several neurological abnormalities, usually involving the central nervous system, due to deformities in the skeletal structures surrounding it. Neurological complications, especially basilar invagination, may adversely affect life expectancy. In OI, this is most often due to upwards migration of the dens,[38][13]: 106–107  a feature of the C2 vertebra. Neurosurgery may be needed to correct severe abnormalities when they risk the patient's life or cause either great suffering or intolerable neurological deficits.[38][13]: 106–107\nAs its biological causes have been more precisely determined, it has become more widely recognized that while the primary disease process of OI happens in the bones, the most common types of OI—those caused by type I collagen gene mutations—affect virtually all of the human body's organs in some way.[15]\nType I collagen is present throughout the circulatory and respiratory systems: from the ventricles of the heart itself, to the heart valves, to the vasculature,[1]: 329  it is an integral part of the connective tissue of the lungs.[1]: 336  As such, cardiovascular complications, among them aortic insufficiency, aortic aneurysm, and arterial dissections, are sometimes comorbid with OI,[1]: 333  but not as frequently as they are comorbid with Marfan syndrome.[1]: 332\nRespiratory illnesses are a major cause of death in OI.[12][1]: 335  The most obvious source of respiratory problems in OI is pulmonary insufficiency caused by problems in the architecture of the thoracic wall.[1]: 341  However, respiratory tract infections, such as pneumonia, are also more fatal among those with OI than the general population.[12][39] Those with more severe ribcage deformities were found to have worse lung restriction in a small-scale 2012 study involving 22 Italian patients with OI types III and IV, plus 26 non-affected controls.[12]\nOI—especially its severe form, type III—also has effects on the gastrointestinal system. It was found to be associated with recurrent abdominal pain and chronic constipation in two studies on patients affected by OI.[40][41] Chronic constipation is especially common,[1]: 377  and is thought to be aggravated by an asymmetric pelvis (acetabular protrusion).[1]: 377 [41] Especially in childhood, OI-associated constipation may cause a feeling of fullness and associated food refusal, leading to malnutrition.[1]: 377",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is typically based on medical imaging, including plain X-rays, and symptoms. In severe OI, signs on medical imaging include abnormalities in all extremities and the spine.[97] As X-rays are often insensitive to the comparatively smaller bone density loss associated with type I OI, DEXA scans may be needed.[5]: 1514\nAn OI diagnosis can be confirmed through DNA or collagen protein analysis, but in many cases, the occurrence of bone fractures with little trauma and the presence of other clinical features such as blue sclerae are sufficient for a diagnosis. A skin biopsy can be performed to determine the structure and quantity of type I collagen. While DNA testing can confirm the diagnosis, it cannot absolutely exclude it because not all mutations causing OI are yet known and/or tested for.[83]: 491–492  OI type II is often diagnosed by ultrasound during pregnancy, where already multiple fractures and other characteristic features may be visible. Relative to control, OI cortical bone shows increased porosity, canal diameter, and connectivity in micro-computed tomography.[98] OI can also be detected before birth by using an in vitro genetic testing technique such as amniocentesis.[99]\nTo determine whether osteogenesis imperfecta is present, genetic sequencing of the most common problematic genes, COL1A1, COL1A2, and IFITM5, may be done;[100] if no mutation is found yet OI is still suspected, the other 10+ genes known to cause OI may be tested.[16] Duplication and deletion testing is also suggested to parents who suspect their child has OI.[100] The presence of frameshift mutations caused by duplications and deletions is generally the cause of increased severity of disease.[100]\nAn important differential diagnosis of OI is child abuse, as both may present to a clinician with multiple fractures in various stages of healing.[5]: 1514  Differentiating them can be difficult, especially when no other characteristic features of OI are present.[1]: 391  This can become an issue in court; in the United States, several child abuse cases were resolved with a finding that osteogenesis imperfecta was the true cause of a child's fractures, leading to lawsuits seeking redress such as Alice Velasquez, et al. v. United States.[1]: 391 [101]\nOther differential diagnoses include rickets and osteomalacia, both caused by malnutrition, as well as rare skeletal syndromes such as Bruck syndrome, hypophosphatasia, geroderma osteodysplasticum, and Ehlers–Danlos syndrome.[5]: 1513 [1]: 253–256  Various forms of osteoporosis, such as iatrogenic osteoporosis, idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis, disuse osteoporosis and exercise-related osteoporosis should also be considered as explanations when OI is suspected.[1]: 255–256",
    "Treatment": "There is no cure for osteogenesis imperfecta.[10] Maintaining a healthy lifestyle by exercising and avoiding smoking can help prevent fractures.[102] Treatment may include care of broken bones, pain medication, physical therapy, mobility aids such as braces or wheelchairs, and surgery.[102]\nJudging the success or failure of treatment can be difficult in OI patients, as decreased bone fracture rates may just be coincidental. While these rates are often used in medical studies to judge treatment efficacy, a Norwegian study of fifteen people with OI emphasized that they feel doctors should consider the whole patient and not just fracture rates.[103]\nBone fractures are treated in individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta in much the same way as they are treated in the general population; OI bone heals at the same rate as non-OI bone.[1]: 431  A greater emphasis is placed on using lightweight materials to immobilize the fracture, as in moderate or severe types of OI, using heavy casts, such as hip spica casts, can cause fractures at the bones at the boundaries of the cast, as well as generalized osteopenia.[1]: 431  The lightweight cast or splint is then replaced with a removable orthosis after a few weeks and once evidence of union is seen on X-ray.[1]: 431  To prevent a nonunion or malunion, all fractures should be immobilized, even if the fracture seems trivial (microfracture),[1]: 439  as people with OI are at greater risk of nonunion.[1]: 438\nBone infections secondary to fractures are treated as and when they occur with the appropriate antibiotics and antiseptics, as in the general population.[1]: 424\nIn 1998, an initial observational trial demonstrated the effectiveness of intravenous pamidronate, a bisphosphonate which had previously been used in adults to treat osteoporosis. In severe OI, this trial showed that pamidronate reduced bone pain, prevented new vertebral fractures, reshaped previously fractured vertebral bodies, and reduced the number of long-bone fractures.[104]\nAlthough oral bisphosphonates are more convenient and cheaper, they are not absorbed as well, and intravenous bisphosphonates are generally more effective, although this is under study. Some studies have found oral and intravenous bisphosphonates, such as oral alendronate and intravenous pamidronate, equivalent.[105] In a 2013 double-blind trial of children with mild OI, oral risedronate increased bone mineral densities, and reduced nonvertebral fractures. However, it did not decrease new vertebral fractures.[106][107] A Cochrane review in 2016 concluded that though bisphosphonates seem to improve bone mineral density, it is uncertain whether this leads either to a reduction in bone fractures or improvement in the quality of life of individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta.[7] Even in trials with as many as 125 children, no causal link has been found between bisphosphonates and decreased fracture rates; placebo controlled trials were also unable to prove that they brought about increased strength, motor control or lower pain levels.[87]\nBisphosphonates are not as effective at increasing the bone mineral density of adults.[22]\nOI is a genetic disorder and is not caused by insufficient intake of any vitamin or mineral; supplementation cannot cure OI. Nevertheless, people with OI tend to be severely deficient in vitamin D at much higher rates than the general population, and the cause of this is not well understood.[108][109][110] The severity of the deficiency and the likelihood of its occurrence is thought to be related to severity of OI.[109] Vitamin D supplementation may be recommended, at least until levels of 25(OH)D3 in a patient's blood return to normal.[108] Vitamin D deficiency is also a concern as it may decrease the benefit of bisphosphanates.[108]\nA surgery of any type inherently carries more risks when done on a patient who has (especially moderate to severe) OI. Skeletal deformities and dentinogenesis imperfecta may hinder access to the airway.[1]: 333  Use of, and weaning off of, mechanical ventilation is also more challenging to carry out on patients with OI.[1]: 333  During the procedure itself or the healing process, defective OI collagen may lead to bleeding diatheses.[1]: 333\nThe safety of anesthesia is also of more concern among patients with OI,[1]: 333  with anesthetic complications 5.6x more likely to occur when the patient has OI type III.[111] A unique concern of anesthesia in OI is perioperative fracture—fractures sustained due to patient transfer and airway access techniques that, while routine when a patient's bones are strong, may cause injury with brittle OI bones.[112] As an example, due to a 1972 report of a humerus fracture from a sphygmomanometer cuff sustained in an OI patient during surgery, blood pressure monitoring protocols are often modified for patients with OI, with neonatal size cuffs and machine settings being used even in adults;[113]: ¶11.72  further, the least deformed of the patient's limbs is preferred to receive the cuff.[20]: ¶14.23",
    "Prognosis": "The prognosis of osteogenesis imperfecta depends entirely on its type (see § Classification).\nIn the mild form of the disorder, type I, the life expectancy of patients is near that of the general population.[1]: 461  In type II, however, patients only very rarely live past the age of two, and typically die in their first weeks of life.[5]: 1511  Assessment of the life expectancy of patients with types III and IV is more complicated, as lifestyle choices can cause fatally traumatic injuries that would not have otherwise occurred, or not been fatal in the general population. Life expectancy in type IV OI is thought to be close to normal, but in type III it is lower than in the general population.[48]\nA 2016 study of data in Denmark's National Patient Register [da] found that across all types of OI, all-cause mortality was three times higher, leading to a loss of around seven years in females and nine years in males.[15] A 1996 study published in the British Medical Journal found that mortality in type III OI is significantly higher, with many patients dying in their 20's, 30's, and 40's; patients who survive to the age of 10 were further found to have longer life expectancy than newborns.[137]\nPeople with mild (type I) OI as adults need few pieces of adaptive equipment, although in infancy they reach motor milestones at a significant delay compared to the general population.[1]: 477\nWith adaptive equipment such as crutches, motorized wheelchairs, splints, reach extenders, and/or modifications to the home, many individuals with moderate to severe OI can achieve or maintain a significant degree of independence.[18][1]: 488  With treatment and physical therapy, the maximum levels of mobility are expected to be unassisted community walking for type I, household or exercise walking for type III, and household or community walking for type IV; due to the variability of OI between individuals, mobility achieved varies and may be below this expected maximum.[1]: 476",
    "Epidemiology": "In the United States, the incidence of osteogenesis imperfecta is estimated to be one per 20,000 live births.[138] An estimated 20,000 to 50,000 people are affected by OI in the United States.[139]\nThe most common types are I, II, III, and IV, while the rest are very rare.[140] Type I is the most common and has been reported to be around three times more common than type II. The prevalence of types III and IV is less certain.[23] In a 1989 study in Denmark, type I was found to comprise 71% of cases and type II 12% of cases, with other types comprising the other 17%.[15] In a 2015 study in Sweden, type I was nearly six times more common than type III and nearly four times more common than type IV.[24]\nMost people with OI receive it from a parent, but in many cases, it is a brand new (de novo or \"sporadic\") mutation in a family. Among a study of patients with survivable types of OI, OI type III is most often de novo (85%), followed by type IV (50%) and type I (34%).[6]: Table 1\nSome populations can have a higher incidence of OI than would be otherwise expected if they have a larger-than-average number of carriers of the recessive forms of the disease.[1]: 20–21 [141]"

    "Disease": "Osteopetrosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Despite this excess bone formation, people with osteopetrosis tend to have bones that are more brittle than normal. Mild osteopetrosis may cause no symptoms, and present no problems.[5]\nHowever, serious forms can result in the following:[5]\nAutosomal recessive osteopetrosis (ARO), also known as malignant infantile osteopetrosis or infantile malignant osteopetrosis (IMO), is a rare type of skeletal dysplasia characterized by a distinct radiographic pattern of overall increased density of the bones with fundamental involvement of the medullary portion. Infantile osteopetrosis typically manifests in infancy. Diagnosis is principally based on clinical and radiographic evaluation, confirmed by gene analysis where applicable.[7] As a result of medullary canal obliteration and bony expansion, grave pancytopenia, cranial nerve compression, and pathologic fractures may ensue. The prognosis is poor if untreated. The classic radiographic features include endobone or \"bone-within-bone\" appearance in the spine, pelvis and proximal femora, upper limbs, and short tubular bones of the hand. Additionally, there is the Erlenmeyer flask deformity type 2 which is characterized by the absence of normal diaphyseal metaphysical modeling of the distal femora with abnormal radiographic appearance of trabecular bone and alternating radiolucent metaphyseal bands.[7]\nThe precise and early diagnosis of infantile osteopetrosis is important for management of complications, genetic counselling, and timely institution of appropriate treatment, namely hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), which offers a satisfactory treatment modality for a considerable percentage of infantile osteopetrosis.[8] Amelioration of radiographic bone lesions after HSCT in infantile osteopetrosis has been proposed as an important indicator of success of the therapy. A few publications with limited study participants have demonstrated the resolution of skeletal radiographic pathology following HSCT.[9][10]\nAutosomal dominant osteopetrosis (ADO) is also known as Albers-Schönberg disease. Most do not know they have this disorder because most individuals do not show any symptoms. However, those who do show symptoms will typically have a curvature of the spine (scoliosis) and multiple bone fractures. There are two types of adult osteopetrosis based on the basis of radiographic, biochemical, and clinical features.[11]\nMany patients will have bone pains. The defects are very common and include neuropathies due to cranial nerve entrapment, osteoarthritis, and carpal tunnel syndrome. About 40% of patients will experience recurrent fractures of their bones. 10% of patients will have osteomyelitis of the mandible.[11]",
    "Causes": "The various types of osteopetrosis are caused by genetic changes (mutations) in one of at least ten genes. There is nothing a parent can do before, during or after a pregnancy to cause osteopetrosis in a child.[5]\nNormally, bone growth is a balance between osteoblasts (cells that create bone tissue) and osteoclasts (cells that destroy bone tissue). This process is necessary to keep bones strong and healthy. Those with osteopetrosis have a deficiency of osteoclasts, meaning too little bone is being resorbed, resulting in too much bone being created. The genes associated with osteopetrosis are involved in the development and/or function of osteoclasts, cells that break down bone tissue when old bone is being replaced by new bone (bone remodeling). Mutations in these genes can lead to abnormal osteoclasts(termed osteoclast-rich osteopetrosis), or having too few osteoclasts(osteoclast-poor osteopetrosis).[13] If this happens, old bone cannot be broken down as new bone is formed, so bones become too dense and prone to breaking.[5]\nThree different types of inheritance-autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive and X-linked recessive have been observed.[11]",
    "Diagnosis": "The differential diagnosis of osteopetrosis includes other disorders that produce osteosclerosis. They constitute a wide array of disorders with clinically and radiologically diverse manifestations. Among the differential diagnosis are hereditary ostoesclerosing dysplasias such as; neuropathic infantile osteopetrosis, infantile osteopetrosis with renal tubular acidosis, infantile osteopetrosis with immunodeficiency, infantile osteopetrosis with leukocyte adhesion deficiency syndrome (LAD-III), pyknodysostosis (osteopetrosis acro-osteolytica), osteopoikilosis (Buschke–Ollendorff syndrome), osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis, mixed sclerosing skeletal dysplasias, progressive diaphyseal dysplasia (Camurati–Engelmann disease), SOST-related sclerosing skeletal dysplasias.[7] Besides, the differential diagnosis includes acquired conditions that induce osteosclerosis such as osteosclerotic metastasis notably carcinomas of the prostate gland and breast, Paget's disease of bone, myelofibrosis (primary disorder or secondary to intoxication or malignancy), Erdheim–Chester disease, osteosclerosing types of osteomyelitis, sickle cell disease, hypervitaminosis D, and hypoparathyroidism.[20]",
    "Treatment": "It was the first genetic disease treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (osteoclasts are derived from hematopoietic precursors).[21][22] There is no cure, although curative therapy with bone marrow transplantation is being investigated in clinical trials. It is believed the healthy marrow will provide cells from which osteoclasts will develop.[5] If complications occur in children, patients can be treated with vitamin D. Gamma interferon has also been shown to be effective, and it can be associated to vitamin D. Erythropoetin has been used to treat any associated anemia. Corticosteroids may alleviate both the anemia and stimulate bone resorption. Fractures and osteomyelitis can be treated as usual.[5] Treatment for osteopetrosis depends on the specific symptoms present and the severity in each person. Therefore, treatment options must be evaluated on an individual basis. Nutritional support is important to improve growth and it also enhances responsiveness to other treatment options. A calcium-deficient diet has been beneficial for some affected people.[5]\nTreatment is necessary for the infantile form:[5]\nBone marrow transplantation (BMT) improves some cases of severe, infantile osteopetrosis associated with bone marrow failure, and offers the best chance of longer-term survival for individuals with this type.[5]\nIn pediatric (childhood) osteopetrosis, surgery is sometimes needed because of fractures. Adult osteopetrosis typically does not require treatment, but complications of the condition may require intervention. Surgery may be needed for aesthetic or functional reasons (such as multiple fractures, deformity, and loss of function), or for severe degenerative joint disease.[5]",
    "Prognosis": "The long-term outlook for people with osteopetrosis depends on the subtype and the severity of the condition in each person. The severe infantile forms of osteopetrosis are associated with shortened life expectancy, with most untreated children not surviving past their first decade. Bone marrow transplantation seems to have cured some infants with early-onset disease. However, the long-term prognosis after transplantation is unknown. For those with onset in childhood or adolescence, the effect of the condition depends on the specific symptoms (including how fragile the bones are and how much pain is present). Life expectancy in the adult-onset forms is normal.[23]",
    "Epidemiology": "Approximately eight to 40 children are born in the United States each year with the malignant infantile type of osteopetrosis. One in every 100,000 to 500,000 individuals is born with this form of osteopetrosis. Higher rates have been found in Denmark and Costa Rica. Males and females are affected in equal numbers.[24]\nThe adult type of osteopetrosis affects about 1,250 individuals in the United States. One in every 200,000 individuals is affected by the adult type of osteopetrosis. Higher rates have been found in Brazil. Males and females are affected in equal numbers.[24]\nOsteopetrosis affects one newborn out of every 20,000 to 250,000[25] worldwide, but the odds are much higher in the Russian region of Chuvashia (1 of every 3,500–4,000 newborns) due to genetic traits of the Chuvash people.[26][27]"

Due to the genetic makeup of an SRY gene, it implies that ovotesticular syndrome is more of a heterogeneous condition.[17]",
    "Epidemiology": "Ovotesticular syndrome represents 5% of all sex disorder differentiations.[21]\nThe exact number of confirmed cases is uncertain, but by 1991 approximately 500 cases had been confirmed.[3]\nIt has also been estimated that more than 525 have been documented.[22] While it can appear anywhere in the world, and be reported or unreported, the greatest amounts reported of ovotesticular syndrome is from Africa and Europe.[23]",

    "Disease": "Paramyotonia congenita",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Patients typically complain of muscle stiffness that can continue to focal weakness. This muscle stiffness cannot be walked off, in contrast to myotonia congenita. These symptoms are increased (and sometimes induced) in cold environments. For example, some patients have reported that eating ice cream leads to a stiffening of the throat. For other patients, exercise consistently induces symptoms of myotonia or weakness. Typical presentations of this are during squatting or repetitive fist clenching. Some patients also indicate that specific foods are able to induce symptoms of paramyotonia congenita. Isolated cases have reported that carrots and watermelon are able to induce these symptoms. The canonical definition of this disorder precludes permanent weakness in the definition of this disorder. In practice, however, this has not been strictly adhered to in the literature.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis of paramyotonia congenita is made upon evaluation of patient symptoms and case history. Myotonia must increase with exercise or movement and usually must worsen in cold temperatures. Patients that present with permanent weakness are normally not characterized as having PC. Electromyography may be used to distinguish between paramyotonia congenita and myotonia congenita.[32],[33] Clinicians may also attempt to provoke episodes or myotonia and weakness/paralysis in patients in order to determine whether the patient has PC, hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, or one of the potassium-aggravated myotonias. Genomic sequencing of the SCN4A gene is the definitive diagnostic determinant.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Some patients do not require treatment to manage the symptoms of paramyotonia congenita. Others require treatment for their muscle stiffness and often find mexiletine to be helpful. Others have found acetazolamide to be helpful as well.[34] Avoidance of myotonia triggering events is also an effective method of myotonia prevention.[citation needed]",
    "Epidemiology": "Paramyotonia congenita is considered an extremely rare disorder, though little epidemiological work has been done. Prevalence is generally higher in European-derived populations and lower among Asians. Epidemiological estimates have been provided for the German population. There, it was estimated that the prevalence of PC is between 1:350,000 (0.00028%) and 1:180,000 (0.00056%).[20] However, the German population of patients with PC is not uniformly distributed across the country. Many individuals with PC herald from the Ravensberg area in North-West Germany, where a founder effect seems to be responsible for most cases.[20][35] The prevalence here is estimated at 1:6000 or 0.017%.[citation needed]"

  {
    "Disease": "Paroxysmal exercise-induced dystonia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Episodes are relatively short-lived, lasting anywhere from 5–30 minutes, and in most cases disappear completely after cessation of the physical exercise.  Most patients will experience 1 to 5 episodes per month, but some can have attacks daily.[2] The muscles most often affected are usually in the legs and feet (75% of reported cases), but the upper body muscles such as the arms, face, neck, and trunk have also been observed to be affected during the episodes of dystonia.[3] Age of onset is usually sometime in childhood, but can range from 1–30 years old.[4] In one study it was found that the mean age of onset was around 8 years. Similarly in the study, the legs were the most common affected part of the body and the attacks were reported as stiffening and cramps by those affected. During an episode of PED patients find walking nearly impossible.[5] Cerebral spinal fluid analysis showed a two-fold increase of homovanillic acid and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid immediately following exercise compared to normal levels.  This indicated that increased dopaminergic transmission could contribute to PED and other paroxysmal dyskinesias.[6] Neurological examinations, EEG, and brain imaging are all normal in PED patients.[7]",
    "Causes": "In most cases, PED is familial, but can also be sporadic.   In familial cases, pedigrees examined have shown PED to be an autosomal-dominant inheritance trait.[2] PED also has been associated with Parkinson's disease, epilepsy and migraines, although the exact relationship between these is unknown.[8]\nA suspected contributor to familial PED is a mutation in the GLUT1 gene, SLC2A1, which codes for the transporter GLUT1, a protein responsible for glucose entry across the blood–brain barrier.[5]  It is not thought that the mutation causes a complete loss of function of the protein but rather only slightly reduces the transporter's activity.[8]  In a study of PED patients, a median cerebrospinal fluid/blood glucose ratio of .52 compared to a normal .60 was found.  In addition, reduced glucose uptake by mutated transporters compared with wild-type in Xenopus oocytes confirmed a pathogenic role of these mutations.[5]\nAnother recent study was performed to continue to look at the possible connection between PED and mutations on the SLC2A1 gene which codes for the GLUT1 transporter. While PED can occur in isolation it was also noted that it occurs in association with epilepsy as well. In this study the genetics of a five-generation family with history of PED and epilepsy were evaluated. From the results it was noted that most of the mutations were due to frameshift and missense mutations. When looking at homologous GLUT1 transporters in other species it was noted that serine (position 95), valine (position 140), and asparagine (position 317) were highly conserved and therefore mutations in these residues would most likely be pathogenic. Therefore, these are areas of interest when looking at what could lead to PED. All mutations that were observed appeared to only affect the ability of GLUT1 to transport glucose and not the ability for it to be inserted in the membrane. The observed maximum transport velocity of glucose was reduced anywhere from 3 to 10 fold.[5]\nA study was performed to determine if the mutation known for the PNKD locus on chromosome 2q33-35 was the cause of PED.  In addition, other loci were observed such as the familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) locus on chromosome 19p, or the familial infantile convulsions and paroxysmal choreoathetosis (ICCA).  All three of these suspected regions were found to not contain any mutations, and were therefore ruled out as possible candidates for a cause of PED.[4]\nSporadic cases may be brought on by minor head injuries and concussions.  This was observed in one patient who started experiencing painless dystonia after mild exercise following a concussion.[3]  More research still needs to be done to determine how injuries can induce PED, as little is known in this area.  Two cases of PED have been associated with insulinomas, after removal of which the symptoms of PED were resolved.[3]",
    "Diagnosis": "Since the age of onset is relatively young of PED it is important to correctly diagnose this disease. The limited cases and limited knowledge of the disease makes this difficult but a few characteristics seem to be consistent. It appears that patients with PED would have normal neurological examinations and MRI but the noticeable characteristic would be in low levels of glucose in the cerebral spinal fluid due to the GLUT1 mutations.[5]\nPED differs from two closely related disorders, for example paroxysmal kinesogenic dyskinesia (PKD) and paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD), based on what brings on the symptoms, namely prolonged exercise, such as brisk walking or running for at least 10 minutes.  This is in contrast to PKD where the symptoms are brought about by sudden movements, and PNKD where the symptoms are spontaneous in nature and prolonged.  PED is usually affects muscles on both sides of the body (bilateral), it has also been observed to have unilateral effects.[citation needed]\nPED has also been shown to be a precursor to Parkinson's disease.  In two observed cases, PED preceded any symptoms of Parkinson's Disease by 1.5 and 5 years.  Although a rare indicator, PED can be an early sign of the disorder, suggesting they are related.[9]  In one case a patient with PED showed evidence of dopamine depletion revealed by a dopamine transporter SPECT scan.  This is typical of Parkinson's disease, further showing the linkage between the diseases.[10]\nA correlation between epilepsy and PED has been observed in several families across multiple generations, demonstrating an autosomal dominant heritability of symptoms. The occurrence of coexistent seizures and PED symptoms are observed mainly during infancy and childhood, with symptoms of PED continuing throughout a lifetime.[11] Epileptic seizures vary in type and have been observed as absence and generalized seizures. Simultaneous seizure and PED attacks are often premeditated by bouts of dizziness. Attacks have been shown to be reduced or prevented with food ingestion, although the reasons for this are unclear. Various evidence shows that the disorders are likely caused by dysfunction in voltage-gated ion channels, which may lead to abnormal excitability in different brain regions, specifically the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia.[12]",
    "Treatment": "As there appeared to be a connection with PED and mutated GLUT1 transporters a possible treatment was looking at changing patients diets. A common treatment for another disorder (GLUT1 Deficiency Syndrome) with a mutated GLUT1 transporter is the ketogenic diet. The diet is a strict 3:1 ratio of fat (3) to protein and carbohydrates (1). This diet is thought to help restore the unbalance created by the decreased amount of glucose in the brain caused by the faulty GLUT1 transporter. This diet was administered to three patients who had been screened and found to have mutation in their SLC2A genes coding for GLUT1 and were experiencing PED symptoms. All three showed benefit from this treatment and a reduction in their PED episodes. They were able to exercise and run long distances for the first time in their lives. No other studies have been performed using this diet as many patients feel the advantages of the diet do not outweigh its disadvantages.[5]\nAs some cases have noted that patients were able to alleviate or lessen their PED attacks with a sugary snack, another diet that was tried on patients was one rich in carbohydrates with additional frequent carbohydrate-containing snacks. Four patients with reported PED symptoms were put on this diet but no observable improvements were noted and in fact one patient even complained of worsening symptoms.[5]\nAdditionally it has been observed that levodopa may reduce some symptoms associated with PED.  This may demonstrate that PED is a precursor to Parkinson's disease.  Acetazolamide was beneficial to some patients, but also worsened symptoms in others.  Additionally, a modified version of the Atkin's diet helped to regulate glucose levels in the cerebrospinal fluid.[8]  Patients with PED associated with insulinomas appeared to have symptoms resolved after consuming sugary drinks.[3] Currently, there are no drugs that are particularly useful in completely curing all symptoms.[citation needed]",
    "Epidemiology": "There are very few reported cases of PED, there are approximately 20 reported sporadic cases of PED and 9 PED families but there is some dispute on the exact number of cases.[5] In addition it appears that PED becomes less severe with aging. Prior to onset of a PED episode some patients reported onset of symptoms including sweating, pallor, and hyperventilation. In brain scans it was observed that patients suffering form frequent PEDs there was increased metabolism in the putamen of the brain and decreased metabolism in the frontal lobe.[5] Another study using subtraction single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) imaging technique which was coregistered with an MRI on a patient presented with PED symptoms showed increased cerebral perfusion in the primary somatosensory cortex area, and a mild increase in the region of the primary motor cortex and cerebellum.[13] While all these correlations are not fully understand as to what exactly is happening in the brain it provides areas of interest to study further to hopefully understand PED more fully.[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "Paroxysmal extreme pain disorder",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The most distinctive feature of PEPD is episodic burning pain of the rectum, ocular, and mandibular regions. It should be stressed that while pain often originates or is centered in these areas, it can also spread or be diffuse in nature. Pain experienced by patients with this disorder should not be underestimated, as women with the disorder who have also given birth describe PEPD pain as worse than labor pain. Concomitant with this pain is typically flushing, often in an area associated with the pain.[1]\nDuring attacks in infants, the child often looks startled or terrified and can scream inconsolably. These attacks can be precipitated by injections, defecation, wiping of the perineum, eating, or the consumption of oral medication. When attacks occur due to such precipitation, pain and flushing are often present in the area of attack precipitation, though symptoms may also be diffuse in nature.[1]\nOther symptoms may include hypersalivation when attacks are localized in the mandibular region or leg weakness after foot trauma. A prominent non-physical symptom is tonic non-epileptic seizures. Such seizures are more common in infancy and childhood than during adulthood. In older children, inconsolable screaming usually precedes such an attack, followed by apnea, paleness, and stiffness. Such stiffness can last from seconds to a few minutes.[1]\nAttack precipitants are usually physical in nature, such as defecation, eating, or taking medicine. Some less common precipitants are micturition, coitus, and painful stimuli. There are also non-physical precipitants, such as the thought or sight of food. In general, attacks tend to occur in the precipitated area, though this is not always the case. While some individuals have described a build-up to attacks, they generally tend to be abrupt. The duration of these attacks can be from a few seconds to two hours.[1]\nPatients are largely normal between attacks. The only notable problem is constipation, likely due to apprehension of precipitating an attack. This symptom often decreases with age, likely due to coping mechanisms such as the use of stool softeners.[1]",
    "Causes": "The voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.7 is expressed in nociceptive and sympathetic neurons, where it aids in action potential creation and regulation. The mutations in this gene that have been study all alter the channel's ability to inactivate. Sodium channel inactivation is vital for the proper cessation of action potentials. The decrease in inactivation caused by these mutations, then, is expected to cause prolonged action potentials and repetitive firing. Such altered firing will cause increased pain sensation and increased sympathetic nervous system activity, producing the phenotype observed in patients with PEPD.[2]",
    "Diagnosis": "Hematological, biochemical, and metabolic investigations on blood and urine between attacks are normal, as are karyotyping and EKG recordings. EKG recordings during attacks show sinus tachycardia. CT, MRI, EMG, and nerve conduction studies produce normal results. EEG recordings are normal between attacks but show early-onset tachycardia during attacks. On the Neuropathic Pain Questionnaire, patients indicated that pain during attacks is extremely unpleasant and typically felt deep, though also superficial on occasion. Aside from presentation of typical symptoms, mutation of the gene SCN9A aids in appropriate diagnosis, as this gene is mutated in 8 of 14 studied families.[1]",
    "Treatment": "Carbamazepine is at least partly effective at reducing the number or severity of attacks in most PEPD patients. High doses of this drug may be required, perhaps explaining the lack of effect in some individuals. While other epilepsy drugs like gabapentin and topiramate have limited effect in some patients, they have not been shown to be generally effective. Opiate-derived analgesics are also largely ineffective, with only sporadic cases of beneficial effect.[1]",
    "Epidemiology": "PEPD is an extremely rare disorder with only 15 known affected families.[2] There are some cases, however, of individuals originally diagnosed with epilepsy who are later determined to have PEPD. This suggests that rates of PEPD may be higher than currently believed.[3]"

    "Disease": "Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The classic sign of PNH is red discoloration of the urine due to the presence of hemoglobin  and hemosiderin from the breakdown of red blood cells.[8] As the urine is more concentrated in the morning, this is when the color is most pronounced. This phenomenon mainly occurs in those who have the primary form of PNH, who will notice this at some point in their disease course. The remainder mainly experience the symptoms of anemia, such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and palpitations.[5]\nA small proportion of patients report attacks of abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing and pain during swallowing, as well as erectile dysfunction in men; this occurs mainly when the breakdown of red blood cells is rapid, and is attributable to spasm of smooth muscle due to depletion of nitric oxide by red cell breakdown products.[9]\nForty percent of people with PNH develop thrombosis at some point in their illness. This is the main cause of severe complications and death in PNH. These may develop in common sites (deep vein thrombosis of the leg and resultant pulmonary embolism when these clots break off and enter the lungs), but in PNH blood clots may also form in more unusual sites: the hepatic vein (causing Budd–Chiari syndrome), the portal vein of the liver (causing portal vein thrombosis), the superior or inferior mesenteric vein (causing mesenteric ischemia) and veins of the skin. Cerebral venous thrombosis, an uncommon form of stroke, is more common in those with PNH.[5]",
    "Diagnosis": "Blood tests in PNH show changes consistent with intravascular hemolytic anemia: low hemoglobin, raised lactate dehydrogenase, raised bilirubin (a breakdown product of hemoglobin), and decreased levels of haptoglobin; there can be raised reticulocytes (immature red cells released by the bone marrow to replace the destroyed cells) if there is no concurrent problem with production of red cells (such as iron deficiency). The direct antiglobulin test (DAT, or direct Coombs' test) is negative, as the hemolysis of PNH is not caused by antibodies.[5] If the PNH occurs in the setting of known (or suspected) aplastic anemia, abnormal white blood cell counts and decreased platelet counts may be seen at this. In this case, anemia may be caused by insufficient red blood cell production in addition to the hemolysis.[5]\nHistorically, the sucrose lysis test, in which a patient's red blood cells are placed in low-ionic-strength solution and observed for hemolysis, was used for screening.  If this was positive, the Ham's acid hemolysis test (after Dr Thomas Ham, who described the test in 1937) was performed for confirmation.[6][12] The Ham test involves placing red blood cells in mild acid; a positive result (increased RBC fragility) indicates PNH or Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia. This is now an obsolete test for diagnosing PNH due to its low sensitivity and specificity.[citation needed]\nToday, the gold standard is flow cytometry for CD55 and CD59 on white and red blood cells.  Based on the levels of these cell proteins, erythrocytes may be classified as type I, II, or III PNH cells. Type I cells have normal levels of CD55 and CD59; type II have reduced levels; and type III have absent levels.[5] The fluorescein-labeled proaerolysin (FLAER) test is being used more frequently to diagnose PNH.  FLAER binds selectively to the glycophosphatidylinositol anchor and is more accurate in demonstrating a deficit than simply for CD59 or CD55.[6]\nPNH is classified by the context under which it is diagnosed:[5]",
    "Treatment": "There is disagreement as to whether steroids (such as prednisolone) can decrease the severity of hemolytic crises. Transfusion therapy may be needed; in addition to correcting significant anemia, this suppresses the production of PNH cells by the bone marrow, and indirectly the severity of the hemolysis. Iron deficiency develops with time, due to losses in urine, and may have to be treated if present. Iron therapy can result in more hemolysis as more PNH cells are produced.[5]\nPNH is a chronic condition. In patients with only a small clone and few problems, monitoring of the flow cytometry every six months gives information on the severity and risk of potential complications. Given the high risk of thrombosis in PNH, preventive treatment with warfarin decreases the risk of thrombosis in those with a large clone (50% of white blood cells type III).[5][14]\nEpisodes of thrombosis are treated as they would in other patients, but, given that PNH is a persisting underlying cause, it is likely that treatment with warfarin or similar drugs needs to be continued long-term after an episode of thrombosis.[5]",
    "Epidemiology": "PNH is rare, with an annual rate of 1–2 cases per million.[5] The prognosis without disease-modifying treatment is 10–20 years.[53]  Many cases develop in people who have previously been diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The fact that PNH develops in MDS also explains why there appears to be a higher rate of leukemia in PNH, as MDS can sometimes transform into leukemia or aplastic anemia.[5]\n25% of female cases of PNH are discovered during pregnancy. This group has a high rate of thrombosis, and the risk of death of both mother and child are significantly increased (20% and 8% respectively).[5]",

    "Disease": "Parry%E2%80%93Romberg syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Initial facial changes usually involve the area of the face covered by the temporal or buccinator muscles. The disease progressively spreads from the initial location, resulting in atrophy of the skin and its adnexa, as well as underlying subcutaneous structures such as connective tissue, (fat, fascia, cartilage, bones) and/or muscles of one side of the face.[4] The mouth and nose are typically deviated towards the affected side of the face.[5]\nThe process may eventually extend to involve tissues between the nose and the upper corner of the lip, the upper jaw, the angle of the mouth, the area around the eye and brow, the ear, and/or the neck.[4][5] The syndrome often begins with a circumscribed patch of scleroderma in the frontal region of the scalp which is associated with a loss of hair and the appearance of a depressed linear scar extending down through the midface on the affected side. This scar is referred to as a \"coup de sabre\" lesion because it resembles the scar of a wound made by a sabre, and is indistinguishable from the scar observed in frontal linear scleroderma.[6][7]\nIn 20% of cases, the hair and skin overlying affected areas may become hyperpigmented or hypopigmented with patches of unpigmented skin. In up to 20% of cases the disease may involve the ipsilateral (on the same side) or contralateral (on the opposite side) neck, trunk, arm, or leg.[8] The cartilage of the nose, ear and larynx can be involved. The disease has been reported to affect both sides of the face in 5 to 10% of cases.[6]\nSymptoms and physical findings usually become apparent during the first or early during the second decade of life. The average age of onset is nine years of age,[4] and the majority of individuals experience symptoms before 20 years of age. The disease may progress for several years before eventually going into remission (abruptly ceasing).[4]\nNeurological abnormalities are common. Roughly 45% of people with Parry–Romberg syndrome also have trigeminal neuralgia (severe pain in the tissues supplied by the ipsilateral trigeminal nerve, including the forehead, eye, cheek, nose, mouth and jaw) and/or migraine (severe headaches that may be accompanied by visual abnormalities, nausea and vomiting).[8][9]\n10% of affected individuals develop a seizure disorder as part of the disease.[8] The seizures are typically Jacksonian in nature (characterized by rapid spasms of a muscle group that subsequently spread to adjacent muscles) and occur on the side contralateral to the affected side of the face.[4] Half of these cases are associated with abnormalities in both the gray and white matter of the brain—usually ipsilateral but sometimes contralateral—that are detectable on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.[8][10]\nRecession of the eyeball within the orbit is the most common eye abnormality observed in Parry–Romberg syndrome. It is caused by a loss of subcutaneous tissue around the orbit. Other common findings include drooping of the eyelid, constriction of the pupil, redness of the conjunctiva, and decreased sweating of the affected side of the face. Collectively, these signs are referred to as Horner's syndrome. Other ocular abnormalities include ophthalmoplegia (paralysis of one or more of the extraocular muscles) and other types of strabismus, uveitis, and heterochromia of the iris.[11][12]\nThe tissues of the mouth, including the tongue, gingiva, teeth and soft palate are commonly involved in Parry–Romberg syndrome.[5] 50% of affected individuals develop dental abnormalities such as delayed eruption, dental root exposure, or resorption of the dental roots on the affected side. 35% have difficulty or inability to normally open the mouth or other jaw symptoms, including temporomandibular joint dysfunction and spasm of the muscles of mastication on the affected side. 25% experience atrophy of one side of the upper lip and tongue.[8]",
    "Causes": "The fact that some people affected with this disease have circulating antinuclear antibodies in their serum supports the theory that Parry–Romberg syndrome may be an autoimmune disease, specifically a variant of localized scleroderma.[13] Several instances have been reported where more than one member of a family has been affected, prompting speculation of an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. However, there has also been at least one report of monozygotic twins in which only one of the twins was affected, casting doubt on this theory. Further, the National Organization for Rare Disorders has stated there is currently no evidence that Parry–Romberg syndrome is genetic or that it can be passed on to children.[14] Various other theories about the cause and pathogenesis have been suggested, including alterations in the peripheral sympathetic nervous system (perhaps as a result of trauma or infection involving the cervical plexus or the sympathetic trunk), as the literature reported it following sympathectomy, disorders in migration of cranial neural crest cells, or chronic cell-mediated inflammatory process of the blood vessels. It is likely that the disease results from different mechanisms in different people, with all of these factors potentially being involved.[4]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis can be made solely on the basis of history and physical examination in people who present with only facial asymmetry. For those who report neurological symptoms such as migraine or seizures, MRI scan of the brain is the imaging modality of choice. A diagnostic lumbar puncture and serum test for autoantibodies may also be indicated in people who present with a seizure disorder of recent onset.[8] Oligoclonal bands and an elevated IgG index may be found in 50% of the patients.[15]",
    "Treatment": "Medical management may involve immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate, corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, and azathioprine. No randomized controlled trials have yet been conducted to evaluate such treatments, so the benefits have not been clearly established.[8]\nAffected individuals may benefit from autologous fat transfer or fat grafts to restore a more normal contour to the face. However, greater volume defects may require microsurgical reconstructive surgery which may involve the transfer of an island parascapular fasciocutaneous flap or a free flap from the groin, rectus abdominis muscle (Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous or \"TRAM\" flap) or latissimus dorsi muscle to the face. Severe deformities may require additional procedures, such as pedicled temporal fascia flaps, cartilage grafts, bone grafts, orthognathic surgery, and bone distraction.[16] The timing of surgical intervention is controversial; some surgeons prefer to wait until the disease has run its course[5] while others recommend early intervention.[17]",
    "Epidemiology": "Parry–Romberg syndrome appears to occur randomly and for unknown reasons. Prevalence is higher in females than males, with a ratio of roughly 3:2. The condition is observed on the left side of the face about as often as on the right side.[18]"

    "Disease": "Pelizaeus%E2%80%93Merzbacher disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The hallmark signs and symptoms of Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease include little or no movement in the arms or legs, respiratory difficulties, and characteristic horizontal movements of the eyes left to right.[citation needed]\nThe onset of Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease is usually in early infancy. The most characteristic early signs are nystagmus (rapid, involuntary, rhythmic motion of the eyes) and low muscle tone.  Motor abilities are delayed or never acquired, mostly depending upon the severity of the mutation. Most children with Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease learn to understand language, and usually have some speech. Other signs may include tremor, lack of coordination,  involuntary movements, weakness, unsteady gait, and over time, spasticity in legs and arms.  Muscle contractures often occur over time. Mental functions may deteriorate. Some patients may have convulsions and skeletal deformation, such as scoliosis, resulting from abnormal muscular stress on bones.[3]",
    "Causes": "Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease is caused by X-linked recessive mutations in the major myelin protein proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1). This causes hypomyelination in the central nervous system and severe neurological disease. The majority of mutations result in duplications of the entire PLP1 gene. Deletions of PLP1 locus (which are rare) cause a milder form of Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease than is observed with the typical duplication mutations, which demonstrates the critical importance of gene dosage at this locus for normal CNS function.[4]",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease is often first suggested after identification by magnetic resonance imaging of abnormal white matter (high T2 signal intensity, i.e. T2 lengthening) throughout the brain, which is typically evident by about 1 year of age, but more subtle abnormalities should be evident during infancy. Unless a family history consistent with sex-linked inheritance exists, the condition is often misdiagnosed as cerebral palsy. Once a PLP1 mutation is identified, prenatal diagnosis or preimplantation genetic diagnostic testing is possible.[citation needed]\nThe disease is one in a group of genetic disorders collectively known as leukodystrophies that affect the growth of the myelin sheath, the fatty covering—which acts as an insulator—on nerve fibers in the central nervous system. The several forms of Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease include classic, congenital, transitional, and adult variants.[5] Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease is the common name for hypomyelinating leukodystrophies (HLD).[6] There are at least 26 HLD variants cataloged by the National Institutes of Health National Library of Medicine[7] and the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) compendium of human genes and genetic phenotypes.[8]\nMilder mutations of the PLP1 gene that mainly cause leg weakness and spasticity, with little or no cerebral involvement, are classified as spastic paraplegia 2 (SPG2).[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "No cure for Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease has been developed.[9] Outcomes are variable: people with the most severe form of the disease do not usually survive to adolescence, although with milder forms, survival into adulthood is possible.[9]\nIonis Pharmaceuticals is currently testing ION356, an antisense oligonucleotide targeted against PLP1, in a Phase 1b trial in PMD patients.[10]"

    "Disease": "Pemphigus foliaceus",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The characteristic lesions are crusted, scaly erosions on an erythematous base. In more localized and early disease, lesions are well demarcated and have seborrheic distribution (face, upper trunk, scalp). Small flaccid vesicles, unlike pemphigus vulgaris, are not found. The disease may develop slowly or may rapidly progress, resulting in an exfoliative erythroderma. UV radiation exacerbates pemphigus foliaceus. Patients experience burning and pain. The colloquial term for Brazilian endemic pemphigus, fogo selvagem (Portuguese for “wild fire”) and for the rare Hungarian variant, Csíp mint az erős Pista (Hungarian for \"strong burning by Pista\"), takes into account many of the clinical aspects of this disease: the burning feeling of the skin, the exacerbation of disease by the sun, and the crusted lesions that make the patients appear as if they had been burned.[5][6]",
    "Causes": "The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases describes the disease thus:",
    "Diagnosis": "Pemphigus foliaceus is diagnosed base on history, biopsy of the affected skin, and testing either a blood sample or a skin sample for the antibodies that cause pemphigus.[citation needed]\nThe differential diagnosis includes other forms of pemphigus, bullous impetigo, subcorneal pustular dermatosis, subacute cutaneous LE, and seborrheic dermatitis. As discussed earlier, the demonstration of IgG autoantibodies against epidermal cell surfaces is essential for separating these disorders from the pemphigus family. A complete review of medications should be done to exclude the possibility of drug-induced pemphigus foliaceus. Because the lesions of pemphigus foliaceus may become secondarily infected, the finding of bacteria does not confirm a diagnosis of bullous impetigo. Likewise, a clinical flare or recalcitrant disease may represent a superimposed disorder, e.g. tinea corporis, especially in patients on systemic corticosteroids.[6]",
    "Treatment": "Patients with this type of pemphigus do not necessarily require treatment with systemic therapy; the use of topical corticosteroids may suffice.[5] When the disease is active and widespread, however, the therapy for pemphigus foliaceus is, in general, similar to that for pemphigus vulgaris. In general, immunosuppressive agents, such as azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil and cyclophosphamide, when combined with corticosteroids, may result in gaining early control of the disease and an increased percentage of clinical remissions.[6]",
    "Epidemiology": "The prevalence of pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus in men and women is approximately equal. The mean age of onset of disease is 50 to 60 years, although the range is broad and disease arising in the elderly and in children has been described. In most countries, pemphigus vulgaris is more common than pemphigus foliaceus; exceptions include Finland, Tunisia and Brazil. Patients with fogo selvagem (Brazilian endemic pemphigus) are clinically, histologically and immuno-pathologically similar to patients with sporadic pemphigus foliaceus. However, fogo selvagem occurs in an endemic fashion in certain regions of Brazil (especially along inland riverbeds)[2] and is thought to be caused by an environmental factor(s).[6]"

    "Disease": "Pemphigus vulgaris",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Pemphigus vulgaris most commonly presents with oral blisters (buccal and palatine mucosa, especially), but also includes cutaneous blisters. Other mucosal surfaces, the conjunctiva, nose, esophagus, penis, vulva, vagina, cervix, and anus, may also be affected. Flaccid blisters over the skin are frequently seen with sparing of the skin covering the palms and soles.[5]\nBlisters commonly erode and leave ulcerated lesions and erosions. A positive Nikolsky sign (induction of blistering in normal skin or at the edge of a blister) is indicative of the disease.[5]\nSevere pain with chewing can lead to weight loss and malnutrition.[5]",
    "Diagnosis": "Because it is a rare disease, diagnosis is often complicated and takes a long time.  Early in the disease patients may have erosions in the mouth or blisters on the skin.  These blisters can be itchy or painful.  Theoretically, the blisters should demonstrate a positive Nikolsky's sign, in which the skin sloughs off from slight rubbing, but this is not always reliable. The gold standard for diagnosis is a punch biopsy from the area around the lesion that is examined by direct immunofluorescent staining, in which cells are acantholytic, that is, lacking the normal intercellular connections that hold them together. These can also be seen on a Tzanck smear. These cells are basically rounded, nucleated keratinocytes formed due to antibody-mediated damage to cell adhesion protein desmoglein.\nPemphigus vulgaris is easily confused with impetigo and candidiasis.  IgG4 is considered pathogenic.  The diagnosis can be confirmed by testing for the infections that cause these other conditions, and by a lack of response to antibiotic treatment.[7]",
    "Treatment": "Corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive medications have historically been employed to reduce pemphigus symptoms, yet steroids are associated with serious and long-lasting side effects and their use should be limited as much as possible. Intravenous immunoglobulin, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, azathioprine, and cyclophosphamide have also been used with varying degrees of success.\nAn established alternative to steroids is monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab, which are increasingly being used as first-line treatment.  In the summer of 2018, the FDA granted full approval to rituximab for this application, following a successful fast-track evaluation.[8] In numerous case series, many patients achieve remission after one cycle of rituximab. Treatment is more successful if initiated early on in the course of disease, perhaps even at diagnosis. Rituximab treatment combined with monthly IV immunoglobulin infusions has resulted in long-term remission with no recurrence of disease in 10 years after treatment was halted.[9] This was a small trial study of 11 patients with 10 patients followed to completion.\nDue to the successful use of rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal treatment, in managing this disease, other anti-CD20 drugs such as ocrelizumab,[10] veltuzumab,[11] and ofatumumab[12] have been explored as potential treatments.\nKey companies in Pemphigus Vulgaris therapeutics include Principia Biopharma, Topas Therapeutics and Argenx BVBA.[citation needed] Rituximab demonstrated superior efficacy compared to mycophenolate mofetil in a Phase III clinical trial, results of which were published in 2021.[13]",
    "Epidemiology": "Pemphigus vulgaris is a relatively rare disease that only affects about 1 to 5 people in 1 million in the United Kingdom, with an incidence of 1-10 cases per 1 million people globally. There is an estimated prevalence of 14,000+ cases in the United States[14] and 42,400+ in the seven major markets (US, UK, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Spain) which is five times as prevalent as Pemphigus foliaceous.[citation needed]\nCases of P. vulgaris usually don't develop until after the age of 50 or so. The disease is not contagious which means it cannot be spread from person to person.[15] In 2012, Israeli researchers indicated they had identified a genetic cause for the disease, which they indicated as 40 times more likely to afflict Jews compared to other demographic groups.[16]\nThe data pool is small for rare diseases. Some sources claim females are more affected by the disease, for others men and women are equally affected. The patient advocacy organisation NORD sees people of many different cultures and racial backgrounds similarly affected, but with a prevalence for Ashkenazi Jews, people of Mediterranean, North Indian, and Persian descent.[17] There has been no found difference in the rate of disease when looking at socioeconomic factors as well.[14] If left untreated, 8 of 10 people with the disease die within a year with a cause of death being infection or loss of fluids, which is very common for raw, open sores that are characteristic of P. vulgaris. With treatment, only about 1 in 10 people with the disease die, either from the condition, or side effects of the medicine.[15]\nAn effect of the disease being so rare is that there is not enough evidence to prove that the treatments currently being used are actually as effective as they could be. Doctors are trying to find effective steroid-sparing agents to use in the treatment, to decrease the side effects of long-term steroid treatment. The small amount of case numbers makes it hard to test statistical significance between the affected and the control groups when testing if these types of systematic treatments are effective.[18]"

    "Disease": "Periodic paralysis",
    "Causes": "One of the most common descriptions of periodic paralysis are episodic attacks of muscle weakness, which are commonly associated with serum potassium levels. Physical activity and diet content (carbohydrates) have been identified as PP triggers. Unlike non-dystrophic myotonias, the periodic paralysis phenotype is triggered after resting following exercise. Voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav1.4) mutations are among the key causes behind periodic paralysis.[3]\nHyper-kalemic PP (hyperPP) is identified with high extracellular potassium levels which are typically greater than 5 mM during attacks; however, HyperPP attacks can also take place without rise in potassium concentrations. HyperPP has a prevalence rate of 1/100,000. Patients become symptomatic around the age of 10. The weakness attacks in hyperPP are relatively short lasting, and range from minutes to hours. The attacks can happen upwards of ten times per month.[citation needed]\nHypo-kalemic PP (hypoPP) is associated with low potassium levels. The onset of hypoPP occurs between the ages of 15 and 35. The prevalence of hypoPP is estimated to 1/100,000. HypoPP can be triggered by many external factors such as stress, high-sugar diet, and rest after exercise. During hypoPP attacks, the serum potassium concentrations can drop to less than 3 mM. Furthermore, hypoPP attacks are considerably longer lasting than hyperPP. As exercise is a trigger for periodic paralysis attacks, recently there is more research going into the physiological changes that accompany exercise including changes in blood pH. [3]",
    "Diagnosis": "This disease is unusually difficult to diagnose. Patients often report years of wrong diagnosis and treatments that made them worse instead of better. Part of this may be that migraines are present in up to 50% of patients and can cause a confusing array of symptoms including headaches, speech difficulties and visual, auditory or sensory auras. DNA testing is available for only a half dozen common gene mutations, while dozens of known mutations are possible but are not routinely tested. Electromyography (EMG) findings are not specific but the McManis Protocol, also called the Compound Muscle Amplitude Potential test (CMAP) can be used by a skilled neurologist capable of utilizing the EMG, which can give assistance in diagnosing several of these PP disorders. The old glucose/insulin provocative testing can cause life-threatening symptoms and should not be used.[citation needed]\nAlso of note is that potassium levels do not have to range outside of normal limits to cause serious, even life-threatening paralysis. These diseases are not the same as having a very low level of potassium (hypokalemia) or high potassium (hyperkalemia) and must not be treated as such. The total body store of potassium is usually normal; it is just in the wrong place.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment of the periodic paralyses may include carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (such as acetazolamide, methazolamide or dichlorphenamide), taking supplemental oral potassium chloride and a potassium-sparing diuretic (for hypos) or avoiding potassium (for hypers), thiazide diuretics to increase the amount of potassium excreted by the kidneys (for hypers), and significant lifestyle changes including tightly controlled levels of exercise or activity.  However, treatment should be tailored to the particular type of periodic paralysis.[4][5][6]\nTreatment of periodic paralysis in Andersen-Tawil syndrome is similar to that for other types. However, pacemaker insertion or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator may be required to control cardiac symptoms.[7]",
    "Prognosis": "While the disability can range from minor, occasional weakness to permanent muscle damage, inability to hold a normal job and use of a powerchair, most people function fairly well with drugs and lifestyle changes.[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "Persistent truncus arteriosus",
    "Causes": "Most of the time, this defect occurs spontaneously. Genetic disorders and teratogens (viruses, metabolic imbalance, and industrial or pharmacological agents) have been associated as possible causes.  Up to 50% (varies in studies) of cases are associated with chromosome 22q11 deletions (DiGeorge Syndrome). The neural crest, specifically a population known as the cardiac neural crest, directly contributes to the aorticopulmonary septum.[4][5]\nMicroablation of the cardiac neural crest in developing chick embryos and genetic anomalies affecting this population of cells in rodents results in persistent truncus arteriosus.[6][7][8]\nNumerous perturbations affecting the cardiac neural crest have been associated with persistent truncus arteriosus, some of which include growth factors (fibroblast growth factor 8 and bone morphogenetic protein), transcription factors (T-box, Pax, Nkx2-5, GATA-6, and Forkhead), and gap junction proteins (Connexin). The cardiac neural crest also contributes the smooth muscle of the great arteries.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is based on:[citation needed]\nA well-known classification is the fourfold system developed by Collett and Edwards in 1949.[9] Collett/Edwards Types I, II, and III are distinguished by the branching pattern of the pulmonary arteries:[10][11]\nAnother well-known classification was defined by Stella and Richard Van Praagh in 1965.[11][12] In this classification scheme, the preceding letter (\"A\" or \"B\") refers to the presence or absence, respectively, of a ventricular septal defect. Type B common arterial trunk is extremely rare; so below, only Type A is considered:[citation needed]\nAs both of the above schemes involve four numerals, they can be easily confused. For this reason, the Collette & Edwards scheme usually uses roman numerals while the Van Praagh system uses arabic numerals and the preceding \"A\". Ambiguity as to the system being used can lead to misunderstanding.\nThe classification in the International Paediatric and Congenital Cardiac Code (IPCCC) attempts to eliminate this source of confusion with the following nomenclature scheme, which removes the use of numbered types:[2]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment is with neonatal surgical repair, with the objective of restoring a normal pattern of blood flow.[13] The surgery is open heart, and the patient will be placed on cardiopulmonary bypass to allow the surgeon to work on a still heart. The heart is opened and the ventricular septal defect is closed with a patch. The pulmonary arteries are then detached from the common artery (truncus arteriosus) and connected to the right ventricle using a tube (a conduit or tunnel). The common artery, now separated from the pulmonary circulation, functions as the aorta with the truncal valve operating as the aortic valve. Most babies survive this surgical repair, but may require further surgery as they grow up. For example, the conduit does not grow with the child and may need to be replaced as the child grows.  Furthermore, the truncal valve is often abnormal and may require future surgery to improve its function.\nThere have been cases where the condition has been diagnosed at birth and surgical intervention is an option. A number of these cases have survived well into adulthood.[14]",
    "Epidemiology": "Persistent truncus arteriosus is a rare cardiac abnormality that has a prevalence of less than 1%.[3][15]"

    "Disease": "Plummer%E2%80%93Vinson syndrome",
    "Causes": "The cause of Plummer–Vinson syndrome is unknown; however, both genetic factors and nutritional deficiencies may play a role. The syndrome is more common in women, particularly those in middle age, with a peak incidence occurring in individuals over 50 years of age.[4]",
    "Diagnosis": "The following clinical presentations may be indicative of Plummer–Vinson syndrome and may be used in its diagnosis:[citation needed]\nThe following tests are helpful in the diagnosis of Plummer–Vinson syndrome:\nComplete blood cell counts, peripheral blood smears, and iron studies (e.g., serum iron, total iron-binding capacity, ferritin, and saturation percentage) are essential for confirming iron deficiency, with or without the presence of hypochromic microcytic anemia.[citation needed]\nBarium esophagography and videofluoroscopy can aid in detecting esophageal webs. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy allows for the visual confirmation of these webs, which are caused by subepithelial fibrosis.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment for Plummer–Vinson syndrome primarily focuses on correcting the underlying iron-deficiency anemia. Patients should receive iron supplementation as part of their diet, which may alleviate symptoms such as dysphagia and pain.[1] If symptoms persist, the esophageal web can be dilated using esophageal bougies during upper endoscopy, which allows for normal swallowing and the passage of food.[5] However, there is a risk of perforation of the esophagus with the use of dilators for treatment.",
    "Prognosis": "Patients generally respond well to treatment. Iron supplementation usually resolves the anemia and corrects the glossodynia (tongue pain).[1] Plummer–Vinson syndrome is recognized as a risk factor for developing squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, esophagus, and hypopharynx.[6] The risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is also increased,[1] and therefore, the syndrome is considered a premalignant condition.[7]",
    "Epidemiology": "Plummer–Vinson syndrome (PVS) is an extremely rare condition, and its exact prevalence remains unknown. While it is becoming less common in developed countries, the condition is increasingly found in developing regions, particularly in Asia.[7] However, it is very rarely observed in African countries, despite the relatively high prevalence of iron deficiency there.[7]"

    "Disease": "Porphyria cutanea tarda",
    "Signs and symptoms": "PCT is typically characterised by fragile skin and sore blisters in areas of skin that receive higher levels of exposure to sunlight, such as the face and backs of the hands.[1] These blisters burst easily resulting in erosions, crusts, and superficial ulcers.[1][2] There is often associated darkened skin color and extra facial hair growth.[1] Healing is typically slow, leading to scarring and milia, while changes such as hair loss, and alterations in nails may also occur.[1] A slightly purplish tint may be seen around the eyes.[1] Scleroderma-like thick skin may develop over fingers, scalp, behind the ears, at the back of the neck, or in the front of the chest.[1][2] The urine may appear dark with a hint of reddishness.[2]\nIn addition to the skin lesions, chronic liver disease is very common in patients with sporadic PCT.  This involves hepatic fibrosis (scarring of the liver), and inflammation. However, liver problems are less common in patients with the inherited form of the disease.[5] Additionally, patients will often void a wine-red color urine with an increased concentration of uroporphyrin I due to their enzymatic deficiency.[6]\nCertain vitamin and mineral deficiencies are common in people with porphyria cutanea tarda. The most common deficiencies are beta-Carotene,[7] retinol,[8] vitamin A[9] and vitamin C.  Beta-Carotene is required to synthesize vitamin A, and vitamin A is needed to synthesize retinol. A lack of retinol-binding protein is due to a lack of retinol, which is required to trigger its production.[9]\nPorphyrins interact with iron, absorbing photons to create reactive oxygen species is the mechanism of action causing the itchy, painful blisters of PCT.[7]  The reactive oxygen species consume the skin antioxidants beta-carotene, vitamin E, and vitamin C.  Supplementation of these three vitamins reduces the oxidation and potentially diminishes the severity of blister formation.[10]  No single one of the three vitamins can inhibit the damaging effects of oxidized porphyrins, specifically uroporphyrins and coproporphyrins, but all three working together synergistically are capable of neutralizing their damaging effects.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "While the most common symptom of PCT is the appearance of skin lesions and blistering, their appearance is not conclusive. Laboratory testing commonly reveals high levels of uroporphyrinogen in the urine, clinically referred to as uroporphyrinogenuria.  Additionally, testing for common risk factors such as hepatitis C and hemochromatosis is strongly suggested, as their high prevalence in patients with PCT may require additional treatment.  If the clinical appearance of PCT is present, but the laboratories are negative, the diagnosis of pseudoporphyria should be seriously considered.[citation needed]\nSome sources divide PCT into two types: sporadic and familial.[25] Other sources include a third type,[26] but this is less common.\nOne study used 74% as the cutoff for UROD activity, with those patients under that number being classified as type II, and those above classified as type III if there was a family history, and type I if there was not.[27]\nGenetic variants associated with hemochromatosis have been observed in PCT patients,[13] which may help explain inherited PCT not associated with UROD.",
    "Treatment": "Since PCT is a chronic condition, comprehensive management of the disease is the most effective form of treatment. Primarily, it is key that patients diagnosed with PCT avoid alcohol consumption, iron supplements, excess exposure to sunlight (especially in the summer), as well as estrogen and chlorinated cyclic hydrocarbons, all of which can potentially exacerbate the disorder.  Additionally, the management of excess iron (due to the commonality of hemochromatosis in PCT patients) can be achieved through phlebotomy, whereby blood is systematically drained from the patient. A borderline iron deficiency has been found to have a protective effect by limiting heme synthesis.  In the absence of iron, which is to be incorporated in the porphyrin formed in the last step of the synthesis, the mRNA of erythroid 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS-2) is blocked by attachment of an iron-responsive element (IRE) binding cytosolic protein, and transcription of this key enzyme is inhibited.[28]\nLow doses of antimalarials can be used.[29] Orally ingested chloroquine is completely absorbed in the gut and is preferentially concentrated in the liver, spleen, and kidneys.[30] They work by removing excess porphyrins from the liver via increasing the excretion rate by forming a coordination complex with the iron center of the porphyrin as well as an intramolecular hydrogen bond between a propionate side chain of the porphyrin and the protonated quinuclidine nitrogen atom of either alkaloid.[31] Due to the presence of the chlorine atom, the entire complex is more water-soluble allowing the kidneys to preferentially remove it from the blood stream and expel it through urination.[30][32][33] Chloroquine treatment can induce porphyria attacks within the first couple of months of treatment due to the mass mobilization of porphyrins from the liver into the bloodstream.[30] Complete remission can be seen within 6–12 months as each dose of antimalarial can only remove a finite amount of porphyrins, and there are generally decades of accumulation to be cleared. Originally, higher doses were used to treat the condition, but are no longer recommended because of liver toxicity.[34][35] Finally, due to the strong association between PCT and Hepatitis C, the treatment of Hepatitis C (if present) is vital to the effective treatment of PCT.\nChloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and venesection are typically employed in the management strategy.[36]",
    "Epidemiology": "PCT prevalence is estimated at 1 in 10,000.[37] An estimated 80% of porphyria cutanea tarda cases are sporadic. The exact frequency is not clear because many people with the condition never experience symptoms, and those who do are often misdiagnosed with anything ranging from idiopathic photodermatitis and seasonal allergies to hives.[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "Pre-eclampsia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Edema (especially in the hands and face) was originally considered an important sign for a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia. However, because edema is a common occurrence in pregnancy, its utility as a distinguishing factor in pre-eclampsia is not high. Pitting edema (unusual swelling, particularly of the hands, feet, or face, notable by leaving an indentation when pressed on) can be significant, and should be reported to a healthcare provider.\nFurther, a symptom such as epigastric pain may be misinterpreted as heartburn. Standard features of pre-eclampsia, which are screened for during prenatal visits, include elevated blood pressure and excess protein in the urine. Additionally, some women may develop severe headaches as a sign of pre-eclampsia.[38] In general, none of the signs of pre-eclampsia are specific, and even convulsions in pregnancy are more likely to have causes other than eclampsia in modern practice.[39] Diagnosis depends on finding a coincidence of several pre-eclamptic features, the final proof being their regression within the days and weeks after delivery.[22]",
    "Causes": "The cause of preeclampsia is not fully understood. It is likely related to factors such as:[2][40]\nThose with long-term high blood pressure have a 7 to 8 times higher risk than those without.[44]\nPhysiologically, research has linked pre-eclampsia to the following physiologic changes: alterations in the interaction between the maternal immune response and the placenta, placental injury, endothelial cell injury, altered vascular reactivity, oxidative stress, imbalance among vasoactive substances, decreased intravascular volume, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.[40][45]\nWhile the exact cause of pre-eclampsia remains unclear, there is strong evidence that a major cause predisposing a susceptible woman to pre-eclampsia is an abnormally implanted placenta.[2][40] This abnormally implanted placenta may result in poor uterine and placental perfusion, yielding a state of hypoxia and increased oxidative stress and the release of anti-angiogenic proteins along with inflammatory mediators into the maternal plasma.[40] A major consequence of this sequence of events is generalized endothelial dysfunction.[15] The abnormal implantation may stem from the maternal immune system's response to the placenta, specifically a lack of established immunological tolerance in pregnancy. Endothelial dysfunction results in hypertension and many of the other symptoms and complications associated with pre-eclampsia.[2] When pre-eclampsia develops in the last weeks of pregnancy or a multiple pregnancy, the causation may, in some cases, partly be due to a large placenta outgrowing the capacity of the uterus, eventually leading to the symptoms of pre-eclampsia.[46]\nAbnormal chromosome 19 microRNA cluster (C19MC) impairs extravillus trophoblast cell invasion to the spiral arteries, causing high resistance, low blood flow, and low nutrient supply to the fetus.[47][48][49]\nDespite a lack of knowledge on specific causal mechanisms of pre-eclampsia, there is strong evidence to suggest it results from both environmental and heritable factors. A 2005 study showed that women with a first-degree relative who had a pre-eclamptic birth are twice as likely to develop it themselves. Furthermore, men related to someone with affected birth have an increased risk of fathering a pre-eclamptic pregnancy.[50] Fetuses affected by pre-eclampsia have a higher chance of later pregnancy complications including growth restriction, prematurity, and stillbirth.[51]\nThe onset of pre-eclampsia is thought to be caused by several complex interactions between genetics and environmental factors. Our current understanding of the specifically heritable cause involves an imbalance of angiogenic factors in the placenta.[52] Angiogenesis involves the growth of new blood vessels from existing vessels. An imbalance during pregnancy can affect the vascularization, growth, and biological function of the fetus. The irregular expression of these factors is thought to be controlled by multiple loci on different chromosomes.[53][51][54] Research on the topic has been limited because of the heterogeneous nature of the disease. Maternal, paternal, and fetal genotypes play a role, as do complex epigenetic factors such as whether the parents smoke, maternal age, sexual cohabitation, and obesity.[52] There is very little understanding of the mechanisms of these interactions. Due to the polygenic nature of pre-eclampsia, a majority of the studies that have been conducted thus far on the topic have utilized genome-wide association studies.[50]\nOne known effector of pre-eclampsia is the fetal locus FLT1. Located on chromosome 13 in the q12 region, FLT1 codes for Fms-like tyrosine kinase 1, an angiogenic factor expressed in fetal trophoblasts.[53] Angiogenic factors are crucial for vascular growth in the placenta. An FLT1 soluble isoform caused by a splice variant is sFLT1, which works as an antiangiogenic factor, reducing vascular growth in the placenta. A healthy, normotensive pregnancy is characterized by a balance between these factors. However, upregulation of this variant and overexpression of sFL1 can contribute to endothelial dysfunction. Reduced vascular growth and endothelial dysfunction manifest primarily in maternal symptoms such as kidney failure, swelling, and seizures. However, these factors can also lead to inadequate oxygen, nutrient, or blood supply to the fetus.[55] Furthermore, in this locus region, several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been observed to impact the overexpression of sFL1. Specifically, SNPs rs12050029 and rs4769613's risk alleles are linked with low red blood cell counts and carry an increased risk of late-onset pre-eclampsia.\nPatau syndrome, or Trisomy 13, is also associated with the upregulation of sFLT1 due to the extra copy of the 13th chromosome. Because of this upregulation of an antiangiogenic factor, women with trisomy 13 pregnancies often experience reduced placental vascularization and are at higher risk for developing pre-eclampsia.[56]\nBeyond fetal loci, some maternal loci have been identified as effectors of pre-eclampsia. Alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent hydroxylase expression on chromosome 16 in the q12 region is also associated with pre-eclampsia. Specifically, allele rs1421085 heightens the risk of not just pre-eclampsia but also an increase in BMI and hypertension.[54] This pleiotropy is one of the reasons why these traits are considered to be a risk factor. Furthermore, ZNF831 (zinc finger protein 831) and its loci on chromosome 20q13 were identified as another significant factor in pre-eclampsia. The risk allele rs259983 is also associated with both pre-eclampsia and hypertension, further evidence that the two traits are possibly linked.\nWhile the current understanding suggests that maternal alleles are the main hereditary cause of pre-eclampsia, paternal loci have also been implicated. In one study, paternal DLX5 (Distal-Less Homeobox 5) was identified as an imprinted gene. Located on chromosome 7 in the q21 region, DLX5 serves as a transcription factor often linked with the developmental growth of organs.[57] When paternally inherited, DLX5 and its SNP rs73708843 are shown to play a role in trophoblast proliferation, affecting vascular growth and nutrient delivery.[58]\nBesides specific loci, several important genetic regulatory factors contribute to the development of pre-eclampsia. Micro RNAs, or miRNAs, are noncoding mRNAs that downregulate posttranscriptional gene expression through RNA-induced silencing complexes. In the placenta, miRNAs are crucial for regulating cell growth, angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and metabolism.[59] These placental-specific miRNAs are clustered in large groups, mainly on chromosomes 14 and 19, and irregular expression of either is associated with an increased risk of an affected pregnancy. For instance, miR-16 and miR-29 are vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) and play a role in upregulating sFLT-1. In particular, the overexpression of miRNA miR-210 has been shown to induce hypoxia, which affects spiral artery remodeling, an important part of the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia.[47]\nKnown risk factors for pre-eclampsia include:[60][61]",
    "Treatment": "The definitive treatment for pre-eclampsia is the delivery of the baby and placenta. The danger to the mother persists after delivery, and full recovery can take days or weeks.[22] The timing of delivery should balance the desire for optimal outcomes for the baby while reducing risks for the mother.[40] The severity of the disease and the maturity of the baby are primary considerations.[103] These considerations are situation-specific, and management will vary with situation, location, and institution. Treatment can range from expectant management to expedited delivery by induction of labor or caesarean section. In the case of preterm delivery, additional treatments, including corticosteroid injection to accelerate fetal pulmonary maturation and magnesium sulfate for prevention of cerebral palsy, should be considered. Important in management is the assessment of the mother's organ systems, management of severe hypertension, and prevention and treatment of eclamptic seizures.[40] Separate interventions directed at the baby may also be necessary. Bed rest is not useful and is thus not routinely recommended.[104]\nThe World Health Organization recommends that women with severe hypertension during pregnancy should receive treatment with anti-hypertensive agents.[6] Severe hypertension is generally considered systolic BP of at least 160 or diastolic BP of at least 110.[21] Evidence does not support the use of one anti-hypertensive over another.[40] The choice of which agent to use should be based on the prescribing clinician's experience with a particular agent, its cost, and its availability.[6] Diuretics are not recommended for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its complications.[6] Labetalol, hydralazine and nifedipine are commonly used antihypertensive agents for hypertension in pregnancy.[60] ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are contraindicated as they affect fetal development.[73]\nThe goal of the treatment of severe hypertension in pregnancy is to prevent cardiovascular, kidney, and cerebrovascular complications.[21] The target blood pressure has been proposed to be 140–160 mmHg systolic and 90–105 mmHg diastolic, although values are variable.[105]\nThe intrapartum and postpartum administration of magnesium sulfate is recommended in severe pre-eclampsia for the prevention of eclampsia.[6][40] Further, magnesium sulfate is recommended for the treatment of eclampsia over other anticonvulsants.[6] Magnesium sulfate acts by interacting with NMDA receptors.[73]",
    "Epidemiology": "Pre-eclampsia affects approximately 2–8% of all pregnancies worldwide.[15][2][106] The incidence of pre-eclampsia has risen in the U.S. since the 1990s, possibly as a result of an increased prevalence of predisposing disorders, such as chronic hypertension, diabetes, and obesity.[40]\nPre-eclampsia is one of the leading causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide.[15] Nearly one-tenth of all maternal deaths in Africa and Asia and one-quarter in Latin America are associated with hypertensive diseases in pregnancy, a category that encompasses pre-eclampsia.[6]\nPre-eclampsia is much more common in women who are pregnant for the first time.[107] Women who have previously been diagnosed with pre-eclampsia are also more likely to experience pre-eclampsia in subsequent pregnancies.[60] Pre-eclampsia is also more common in women who have pre-existing hypertension, obesity, diabetes, autoimmune diseases such as lupus, various inherited thrombophilias such as Factor V Leiden, renal disease, multiple gestation (twins or multiple birth), and advanced maternal age.[60] Women who live at high altitude are also more likely to experience pre-eclampsia.[108][109] Pre-eclampsia is also more common in some ethnic groups (e.g. African-Americans, Sub-Saharan Africans, Latin Americans, African Caribbeans, and Filipinos).[40][110][111]\nEclampsia is a major complication of pre-eclampsia. Eclampsia affects 0.56 per 1,000 pregnant women in developed countries and almost 10 to 30 times as many women in low-income countries as in developed countries.[60]"

    "Disease": "Primary ciliary dyskinesia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Around 80% of people with primary ciliary dyskinesia experience respiratory problems beginning within a day of birth. Many have a collapsed lobe of the lung and blood oxygen low enough to require treatment with supplemental oxygen.[1] Within the first few months of life, most develop a chronic mucus-producing cough and runny nose.[1] The main consequence of impaired ciliary function is reduced or absent mucus clearance from the lungs, and susceptibility to chronic recurrent respiratory infections, including sinusitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, and otitis media.  Progressive damage to the respiratory system is common, including progressive bronchiectasis beginning in early childhood, and sinus disease (sometimes becoming severe in adults).  However, diagnosis is often missed early in life despite the characteristic signs and symptoms.[2] In males, immotility of sperm can lead to infertility, although conception remains possible through the use of in vitro fertilization, there also are reported cases where sperm were able to move.[8] Trials have also shown that there is a marked reduction in fertility in females with Kartagener's syndrome due to dysfunction of the oviductal cilia.[9]\nMany affected individuals experience hearing loss and show symptoms of otitis media which demonstrates variable responsiveness to the insertion of myringotomy tubes or grommets. Some patients have a poor sense of smell, which is believed to accompany high mucus production in the sinuses (although others report normal – or even acute – sensitivity to smell and taste). Clinical progression of the disease is variable, with lung transplantation required in severe cases. Susceptibility to infections can be drastically reduced by an early diagnosis. Treatment with various chest physiotherapy techniques has been observed to reduce the incidence of lung infection and to slow the progression of bronchiectasis dramatically. Aggressive treatment of sinus disease beginning at an early age is believed to slow long-term sinus damage (although this has not yet been adequately documented). Aggressive measures to enhance clearance of mucus, prevent respiratory infections, and treat bacterial superinfections have been observed to slow lung-disease progression. The predicted incidence is 1 in approximately 7500.[10]",
    "Diagnosis": "Several diagnostic tests for this condition have been proposed.[5] These include nasal nitric oxide levels as a screening test, light microscopy of biopsies for ciliary beat pattern and frequency and electron microscopic examination of dynein arms, as the definite diagnosis method. Genetic testing has also been proposed but this is difficult given that there are multiple genes involved.[6]\nWhen accompanied by the combination of situs inversus (reversal of the internal organs), chronic sinusitis, and bronchiectasis, it is known as Kartagener syndrome[3] (only 50% of primary ciliary dyskinesia cases include situs inversus).[11]",
    "Treatment": "There are no standardized effective treatment strategies for the condition. Current therapies for PCD are extrapolated from Cystic Fibrosis and patients with non-CF bronchiectasis and lack validation for PCD-specific use.[19]\nSevere fatal respiratory failure can develop; long-term treatment with macrolides such as clarithromycin, erythromycin and azithromycin has been empirically applied for the treatment of primary ciliary dyskinesia in Japan, though controversial due to the effects of the medications.[20]",
    "Prognosis": "There is no reliable estimate of life expectancy for people with PCD.[21]  However, there is evidence that PCD, is a life altering[22] life shortening[23] multi-system condition, with some people progressing to lung transplant.[24][25][26][27]\nDecline in lung function in people with PCD has been observed in most studies,[28][25][29][30][31] with FEV1 decline causing deterioration in health, impacting on, and reducing quality of life.[32] With such a genetically and phenotypically heterogenous group, observation of median/mean decline in lung function risks regression to the mean, missing those groups with significantly worse lung function,[10][33][34][35][36][37][38] masked by those with milder phenotypes.[10][36]\nThe recent body of published data from respected clinicians in (the United Kingdom, Europe, North America, Canada and Israel) indicate that PCD morbidity and mortality appear to have been under-estimated by the medical community.[28][25][39][40][41] While prospective outcome data is limited due to the early-stage patient registries, there is a growing body of evidence[25][39][40][41][42] that dispels any \"myth that PCD is a mild disease.[25][39][40][41][43][44][45]\nThe studies presented here demonstrate that children with PCD typically have worse lung function than those with cystic fibrosis.[28][31][29][46][30] While previously it was thought that with early diagnosis, lung function could largely be prevented in children with PCD,[47] poor lung function is repeatedly observed in children with PCD[46][28][31][29] 1,30,32,33,36–38 and some develop bronchiectasis during[48][33] childhood."

    "Disease": "Primary lateral sclerosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Onset of PLS usually occurs spontaneously after age 50 and progresses gradually over a number of years, or even decades. The disorder usually begins in the legs, but it may start in the tongue or the hands. Symptoms may include difficulty with balance, weakness and stiffness in the legs, and clumsiness. Other common symptoms are spasticity (involuntary muscle contraction due to the stretching of muscle, which depends on the velocity of the stretch) in the hands, feet, or legs, foot dragging, and speech and swallowing problems due to involvement of the facial muscles. Breathing may also become compromised in the later stages of the disease, causing those patients who develop ventilatory failure to require noninvasive ventilatory support.[2] Hyperreflexia is another key feature of PLS as seen in patients presenting with the Babinski's sign.[3]  Some people present with emotional lability and bladder urgency,[3] and occasionally people with PLS experience mild cognitive changes detectable on neuropsychological testing, particularly on measures of executive function.[4]\nPLS is not considered hereditary when onset is in adulthood; however, juvenile primary lateral sclerosis (JPLS) has been linked to a mutation in the ALS2 gene which encodes the cell-signalling protein alsin.[5]\nThe issue of whether PLS exists as a different entity from ALS is not clear, as some patients initially diagnosed as having PLS ultimately develop lower motor neuron signs.[6][7] When this happens it is classed as ALS.[8]\nPLS usually presents with gradual-onset, progressive, lower-extremity stiffness and pain due to muscle spasticity. Onset is often asymmetrical.[2] Although the muscles do not appear to atrophy as in ALS (at least initially), the disabling aspect of PLS is muscle spasticity and cramping, and intense pain when those muscles are stretched, resulting in joint immobility. A  normal walking stride may become a tiny step shuffle with related instability and falling.[citation needed]",
    "Causes": "Researchers do not fully understand what causes PLS, although it is thought it could be due to a combination of environmental and genetic factors.[9] Studies are being done to evaluate the possible causes, although linking causality can be difficult due to the relatively low number of people who are diagnosed with PLS.[citation needed]\nJuvenile PLS may be caused by the ALS2 gene, although this condition is very rare.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "There are no specific tests for the diagnosis of PLS. Therefore, the diagnosis occurs as the result of eliminating other possible causes of the symptoms and by an extended observation period.[10]\nLike ALS, diagnosing PLS is a diagnosis of exclusion, as there is no one test that can confirm a diagnosis of PLS. The Pringle Criteria,[11] proposed by Pringle et al., provides a guideline of nine points that, if confirmed, can suggest a diagnosis of PLS. Due to the fact that a person with ALS may initially present with only upper motor neuron symptoms, indicative of PLS, one key aspect of the Pringle Criteria is requiring a minimum of three years between symptom onset and symptom diagnosis. When these criteria are met, a diagnosis of PLS is highly likely.[12] Other aspects of Pringle Criteria include normal EMG findings, thereby ruling out lower motor neuron involvement that is indicative of ALS, and absence of family history for Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) and ALS. Imaging studies to rule out structural or demyelinating lesions may be done as well. Hoffman's sign and Babinski reflex may be present and indicative of upper motor neuron damage.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment for individuals with PLS is symptomatic. Baclofen and tizanidine may reduce spasticity. Quinine or phenytoin may decrease cramps. Some patients who do not receive adequate relief from oral treatment may consider intrathecal baclofen (i.e., infusion of medication directly into the cerebrospinal fluid via a surgically placed continuous infusion pump). However, patients are carefully selected for this type of procedure to ensure that they will likely benefit from this invasive procedure.[2]\nPhysical therapy often helps prevent joint immobility. Speech therapy may be useful for those with involvement of the facial muscles. Physiotherapy treatment focuses on reducing muscle tone, maintaining or improving range of motion, increasing strength and coordination, and improving functional mobility. In PLS, stretching is thought to improve flexibility and can also reduce muscle spasticity and cramps.[3]\nPatients with PLS may find it beneficial to have an evaluation, as well as follow-up visits at multidisciplinary clinics, similar to those available for people with ALS. These multidisciplinary clinics may provide patients with the necessary treatment that they require by having an occupational therapist, physical therapist, speech language pathologist, dietician and nutritionist, all in one site.[2]",
    "Prognosis": "Patients can often live with PLS for many years and very often outlive their neurological disease and succumb to some unrelated condition.  There is currently no effective cure, and the progression of symptoms varies. Some people may retain the ability to walk without assistance, but others eventually require wheelchairs, canes, or other assistive devices.[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "Progeria",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Most children with progeria appear normal at birth and during early infancy.[11] Children with progeria usually develop the first symptoms during their first few months of life. The earliest symptoms may include a failure to thrive and a localized scleroderma-like skin condition. As a child ages past infancy, additional conditions become apparent, usually around 18–24 months. Limited growth, full-body alopecia (hair loss), and a distinctive appearance (a small face with a shallow, recessed jaw and a pinched nose) are all characteristics of progeria.[5]\nSigns and symptoms of this progressive disease tend to become more marked as the child ages. Later, the condition causes wrinkled skin, kidney failure, loss of eyesight, and atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular problems.[12] Scleroderma, a hardening and tightening of the skin on trunk and extremities of the body, is prevalent. People diagnosed with this disorder usually have small, fragile bodies, like those of older adults. The head is usually large relative to the body, with a narrow, wrinkled face and a beak nose. Prominent scalp veins are noticeable (made more obvious by alopecia), as well as prominent eyes. Musculoskeletal degeneration causes loss of body fat and muscle, stiff joints, hip dislocations, and other symptoms generally absent in the non-elderly population. Individuals usually retain typical mental and motor function.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "Skin changes, abnormal growth, and loss of hair occur. These symptoms normally start appearing by one year of age. A genetic test for LMNA mutations can confirm the diagnosis of progeria.[45][46] Prior to the advent of the genetic test, misdiagnosis was common.[46]\nOther syndromes with similar symptoms (non-laminopathy progeroid syndromes) include:[47]",
    "Treatment": "In November 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved lonafarnib, which helps prevent buildup of defective progerin and similar proteins.[48] A clinical trial in 2018 points to significantly lower mortality rates – treatment with lonafarnib alone compared with no treatment (3.7% vs. 33.3%) – at a median post-trial follow-up time span of 2.2 years.[49] The drug, given orphan drug status and Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher, is taken twice daily in the form of capsules and may cost US$650,000 per year, making it prohibitive for the vast majority of families. It is unclear how it will be covered by health insurance in the United States. Common side effects of the drug include \"nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, infections, decreased appetite, and fatigue\".[13]\nOther treatment options have focused on reducing complications (such as cardiovascular disease) with coronary artery bypass surgery and low-dose acetylsalicylic acid.[50] Growth hormone treatment has been attempted.[51] The use of Morpholinos has also been attempted in mice and cell cultures in order to reduce progerin production. Antisense Morpholino oligonucleotides specifically directed against the mutated exon 11–exon 12 junction in the mutated pre-mRNAs were used.[52]\nA type of anticancer drug, the farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs), has been proposed, but their use has been mostly limited to animal models.[53] A Phase II clinical trial using the FTI lonafarnib began in May 2007.[54] In studies on the cells another anti-cancer drug, rapamycin, caused removal of progerin from the nuclear membrane through autophagy.[20][55] It has been proved that pravastatin and zoledronate are effective drugs when it comes to the blocking of farnesyl group production.[citation needed]\nFarnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) are drugs that inhibit the activity of an enzyme needed to make a link between progerin proteins and farnesyl groups. This link generates the permanent attachment of the progerin to the nuclear rim. In progeria, cellular damage can occur because that attachment occurs, and the nucleus is not in a normal state. Lonafarnib is an FTI, which means it can avoid this link, so progerin can not remain attached to the nucleus rim, and it now has a more normal state.[citation needed]\nStudies of sirolimus, an mTOR Inhibitor, demonstrate that it can minimize the phenotypic effects of progeria fibroblasts. Other observed consequences of its use are abolishing nuclear blebbing, degradation of progerin in affected cells, and reducing insoluble progerin aggregates formation. These results have been observed only in vitro and are not the results of any clinical trial, although it is believed that the treatment might benefit HGPS patients.[20]\nRecently, it has been demonstrated that the CRM1 protein (a key component of the nuclear export machinery in mammalian) is upregulated in HGPS cells, which drives to the abnormal localization of NES containing proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.[56] Moreover, the inhibition of CRM1 in HGPS alleviates the associated-senescence phenotype[56] as well as the mitochondrial function (an important determinant in senescence) and lysosome content.[41] These results are under in vivo validation with selinexor (a more suitable CRM1 inhibitor for human use[57]).",
    "Prognosis": "As there is no known cure, the average life expectancy of people with progeria is 13 years, as of 2003.[58] At least 90 percent of patients die from complications of atherosclerosis, such as heart attack or stroke.[59]\nMental development is not adversely affected; in fact, intelligence tends to be average to above average.[60] With respect to the features of aging that progeria appears to manifest, the development of symptoms is comparable to aging at a rate eight to ten times faster than normal. With respect to those that progeria does not exhibit, patients show no neurodegeneration or cancer predisposition. They also do not develop conditions that are commonly associated with accumulation of damage, such as cataracts (caused by UV exposure) and osteoarthritis.[45]\nAlthough there may not be any successful treatments for progeria itself, there are treatments for the problems it causes, such as arthritic, respiratory, and cardiovascular problems, and recent medicinal breakthroughs enabled one patient to live until age 28.[61] People with progeria have normal reproductive development, and there are known cases of women with progeria who delivered healthy offspring.[62]",
    "Epidemiology": "A study from the Netherlands has shown an incidence of 1 in 20 million births.[63] According to the Progeria Research Foundation, as of September 2020, there are 179 known cases in the world, in 53 countries; 18 of the cases were identified in the United States.[64][13] Hundreds of cases have been reported in medical history since 1886.[65][66][67] However, the Progeria Research Foundation believes there may be as many as 150 undiagnosed cases worldwide.[68]\nThere have been only two cases in which a healthy person was known to carry the LMNA mutation that causes progeria.[69] One family from India had four of six children with progeria.[70]",
    "Society and culture": "In 1987, fifteen-year-old Mickey Hays, who had progeria, appeared along with Jack Elam in the documentary I Am Not a Freak.[83] Elam and Hays first met during the filming of the 1986 film The Aurora Encounter,[84] in which Hays was cast as an alien.  The friendship that developed lasted until Hays died in 1992, on his 20th birthday.

Casey, a freelance artist, was admitted to Yale-New Haven Hospital on the night of May 25 with respiratory problems, which caused her death.[86] Sam Berns was an American activist with the disease.

    "Disease": "Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Symptoms can develop over several weeks to months, and they depend on location of damage in the brain and the degree of damage. The most prominent symptoms are \"clumsiness, progressive weakness, and visual, speech, and sometimes personality changes\".[1]\nThe lesions affecting the parietal and occipital lobes of the brain can lead to a phenomenon known as alien hand syndrome.[2]",
    "Causes": "The cause of PML is a type of polyomavirus called the JC virus (JCV), after the initials of the person (John Cunningham) from whose tissue the virus was first successfully cultured. Publications indicate 39[3] to 58%[4] of the general population are seropositive for antibodies to JCV, indicating current or previous infection with the virus. Other publications put the percentage at 70 to 90% of the general population.[5] JCV causes persistent asymptomatic infection in about one-third of the adult population, based on viral shedding into the urine from the site of asymptomatic infection in the kidney. The virus causes disease only when the immune system has been severely weakened.[6]\nPML is most common in people with HIV1 infection; prior to the advent of effective antiretroviral therapy, as many as 5% of people with AIDS eventually developed PML.[1] Why PML occurs more frequently in people with AIDS than in other immunosuppressive conditions is unclear; some research suggests the effects of HIV on brain tissue, or on JCV itself, make JCV more likely to become active in the brain and increase its damaging inflammatory effects.[7]\nPML can also occur in people on immunosuppressive therapy, such as efalizumab, belatacept, and various transplant drugs, which are meant to weaken the immune system.[8]\nNatalizumab (Tysabri) was approved in 2004 by the FDA for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). It supposedly works by preventing white blood cells from entering the brain. It was subsequently withdrawn from the market by its manufacturer after it was linked with three cases of PML.[8] All three initial cases were taking natalizumab in combination with interferon beta-1a.[8] After a safety review, the drug was returned to the market in 2006 as a monotherapy for MS under a special prescription program.[8] As of May 2011, over 130 cases of PML had been reported in MS patients, all in patients who had taken natalizumab for more than a year.[8] While none of them had taken the drug in combination with other disease-modifying treatments, previous use of MS treatments increases the risk of PML between three- and four-fold.[8] The estimated prevalence of PML in MS is 1.5 cases per thousand natalizumab users.[8] Around 20% of MS patients with PML die, and most of the rest are very disabled.[8] One case study describes an MS patient who, during a 4-year course of dimethyl fumarate, developed PML and died.[9]\nFingolimod (Gilenya) was approved in 2010 by the FDA for MS.  In 2015, the first case of PML and a case of \"probable PML\" were reported by two Gilenya users that could not be tied to previous immunosuppressant therapies.  These new cases are now being added to the drug information sheet included with every prescription (i.e. the \"drug label\").[10]",
    "Diagnosis": "PML is diagnosed in a patient with a progressive course of the disease, finding JC virus DNA in spinal fluid together with consistent white-matter lesions on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); alternatively, a brain biopsy is diagnostic[1] when the typical histopathology of demyelination, bizarre astrocytes, and enlarged oligodendroglial nuclei are present, coupled with techniques showing the presence of JC virus.[12]\nCharacteristic evidence of PML on brain CT scan images are multifocal, noncontrast enhancing hypodense lesions without mass effect, but MRI is far more sensitive than CT.[12] The most common area of involvement is the cortical white matter of frontal and parieto occipital lobes, but lesions may occur anywhere in the brain, such as the basal ganglia, external capsule, and posterior cranial fossa structures such as the brain stem and cerebellum.[12]\nAlthough typically multifocal, natalizumab-associated PML is often monofocal, predominantly in the frontal lobe.[12]",
    "Treatment": "No drugs effectively inhibit or cure the virus infection without toxicity. Therefore, treatment aims at reversing the immune deficiency to slow or stop the disease progress. In patients on immunosuppression, this means stopping the drugs or using plasma exchange to accelerate the removal of the biologic agent that put the person at risk for PML.[1]\nIn HIV-infected people, this may mean starting highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). AIDS patients starting HAART after being diagnosed with PML tend to have a slightly longer survival time than patients who were already on HAART and then develop PML.[13] Some AIDS patients with PML have been able to survive for several years, with HAART.[14] A rare complication of effective HAART is immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), in which increased immune system activity actually increases the damage caused by the JCV infection; although IRIS can often be managed with medication, it is extremely dangerous in PML.[15]\nCidofovir was studied as possible treatment for PML[16] and has been used on a case-by-case basis, working in some, but not others.\nCytarabine (also known as ARA-C), a chemotherapy drug used to treat certain cancers, has been prescribed on an experimental basis for a small number of non-AIDS PML patients, and stabilized the neurological condition of a minority of these patients.[17]  One patient regained some cognitive function lost as a result of PML.[18]\nIn June 2010, the first case report appeared of a PML patient being successfully treated with the antimalarial drug mefloquine with activity against the JC virus. The patient cleared the virus and had no further neurological deterioration.[19] Two case reports of using interleukin-2 successfully have been published.[20] Some success have been reported with mirtazapine, but this has not been demonstrated in clinical trials.[21]\nA number of drugs work against JC virus in cell culture, but no proven, effective therapy is known in humans.[22]\nFor example, Brincidofovir (1-O-hexadecyloxypropyl-cidofovir /CMX001) available as Tembexa, suppresses JCV,[23] but has been found to have toxicity at therapeutic dosage.[24]\nInfusion of donor T cells specific to the related BK polyomavirus has shown possible effect in treating PML in one small study by Katy Rezvani's group, but needs further study.[25]\nIn December 2021, Cellevolve announced it is launching a clinical trial for the treatment of PML utilizing BK virus specific T-cells (VSTs).[26]",
    "Prognosis": "One-third to one-half of people with PML die in the first few months following diagnosis, depending on the severity of their underlying disease. Survivors can be left with variable degrees of neurological disability.[1]"

    "Epidemiology": "PPD is an extremely rare disease. In the United States the disease is estimated to affect less than 5,000 people[2] and approximately 1 per million people in the United Kingdom however it is believed to be more common in Turkey and the Middle East.[4]"

    "Disease": "Progressive supranuclear palsy",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The initial symptoms in two-thirds of cases are loss of balance, lunging forward when mobilizing, fast walking, bumping into objects or people, and falls.[7][3][4] Dementia symptoms are also initially seen in about one in five cases.[8]\nOther common early symptoms are changes in personality, general slowing of movement, and visual symptoms. The most common behavioural  symptoms in patients with PSP include apathy, a lack of inhibition, anxiety, and a profound state of unease or dissatisfaction.[8]\nLater symptoms and signs can include, but do not necessarily include dementia (typically including loss of inhibition and ability to organize information), slurring of speech, difficulty swallowing, and difficulty moving the eyes, particularly in the vertical direction.  The latter accounts for some of the falls experienced by these patients, as they find it difficult to look up or down.[9]\nSome of the other signs are poor eyelid function, contracture of the facial muscles, a backward tilt of the head with stiffening of the neck muscles, sleep disruption, urinary incontinence, and constipation.[9]  Some patients retain full cognitive function up to the end.[10]\nThe visual symptoms are of particular importance in the diagnosis of this disorder.  Patients typically complain of difficulty reading due to the inability to look downwards. The ophthalmoparesis experienced by these patients mainly concerns voluntary eye movement and the inability to make vertical saccades, which is often worse with downward saccades.  Patients tend to have difficulty looking down (a downgaze palsy) followed by the addition of an upgaze palsy. This vertical gaze paresis will correct when the examiner passively rolls the patient's head up and down as part of a test for the oculocephalic reflex.  Involuntary eye movement, as elicited by Bell's phenomenon, for instance, may be closer to normal.[10]\nOn close inspection, eye movements called \"square-wave jerks\" may be visible when the patient fixes gaze at distance. These are fine movements, that can be mistaken for nystagmus, except that they are saccadic in nature, with no smooth phase. Although healthy individuals also make square-wave jerk movements, PSP patients make slower square-wave jerk movements, with smaller vertical components.[11] Assessment of these square-wave jerks and diminished vertical saccades is especially useful for diagnosing progressive supranuclear palsy, because these movements set PSP patients apart from other parkinsonian patients.[11] Difficulties with convergence (convergence insufficiency), where the eyes come closer together while focusing on something near, like the pages of a book, is typical.  Because the eyes have trouble coming together to focus at short distances, the patient may complain of diplopia (double vision) when reading.[9]\nA characteristic facial appearance known as procerus sign, with a wide-eye stare, furrowing of forehead with a frowning expression, and deepening of other facial creases, is also diagnostic of PSP.[12]\nPSP-RS is characterized by a combination of motor, ocular, cognitive, and speech-related impairments, that typically emerge in early stages of the disease. Symptoms of PSP-RS usually begin after 60 and steadily progress over time.[3] Clinical symptoms of PSP-RS often include unexplained falls, unsteady gait, bradykinesia, apathy, disinhibition, cognitive dysfunction, difficulty planning or multitasking, slow speech, and impaired ocular movement.[3][4][13] PSP-RS is also characterized by unresponsiveness to dopamine therapies often prescribed for those with Parkinson's disease.[14] Patients can present initially with symptoms more characteristic of the PSP-Parkinson (PSP-P) subtype which is characterized by asymmetric rigidity, resting tremor, and are more responsive to dopamine therapies such as levadopa compared to PSP-RS.[15] Clinical and pathological differences between PSP-P and PRSP-RS occur within the first year of the disease, with individuals with PSP-RS exhibiting faster progression of symptoms and lower survival rates after diagnosis. Diagnostic criteria distinguish between probable and possible PSP-RS, as definitive diagnosis requires post-mortem neuropathological confirmation.[14] The NINDS-SPSP criteria define probable PSP-RS as requiring both vertical supranuclear gaze palsy and early postural instability with falls, while possible PSP-RS requires either vertical gaze palsy or slowed vertical saccades combined with early falls.[14][13] PSP-RS effects more males than females, with a male to female ratio of 1.8:1.[4] Symptom progression tends to occur more quickly in PSP-RS than other sub-types with the average disease duration being 5.9 years and an average age of death of 72.1 years.[4][10]\nOne of the key features of PSP-RS that occurs within the first year of symptom onset, is early postural instability which often leads to unexplained falls.[6][14][16] Additionally, patients present with axial rigidity, which is characterized by stiffness in the neck and body.[14] This is often accompanied with bradykinesia which is slowness of movement. Although PSP-RS is often misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease, tremors are uncommon in PSP-RS.[4] Motor symptoms are often symmetrical in PSP-RS with both sides of the body being affected.[17]\nA defining feature of PSP-RS is vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, which is difficulty with voluntary downward gaze.[18] Vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, a symptom characterized by decreased velocity and amplitude of vertical eye movements (saccades) is often the prominent diagnostic feature of PSP-RS. Approximately 40% of patients with PSP-RS experiencing supranuclear gaze palsy, but it may not present until 3–4 years after disease onset.[3][18] Individuals with PSP-RS also display other ocular motor symptoms such as dry, red and sore eyes, blurred vision, and difficulty focusing.[10] They may also experience spontaneous and involuntary eye-lid closure or apraxia of the eyelid opening.[10]\nCognitive changes are frequent in PSP-RS compared to other PSP subtypes and include slowed thinking (bradyphrenia), executive dysfunction, and difficulty with planning or problem-solving.[14][16] Some patients exhibit apathy, emotional blunting, or involuntary episodes of laughing or crying unrelated to mood.[10] Some studies report that around half the individuals with PSP-RS develop these personality changes within 2-years of diagnosis.[10] Dementia is not typically a dominant feature early on but may develop in later stages.",
    "Causes": "The cause of PSP is unknown. Fewer than 1% of those with PSP have a family member with the same disorder. A variant in the MAPT gene for tau protein called the H1 haplotype, located on chromosome 17 (rs1800547), has been linked to PSP.[19] Nearly all people with PSP received a copy of that variant from each parent, but this is true of about two-thirds of the general population. The H1 haplotype of the MAPT gene has been identified in approximately 94% of individuals with PSP, compared to around 78% in healthy adults.[20] Therefore, the H1 haplotype appears to be necessary but not sufficient to cause PSP.  Other genes, as well as environmental toxins, are being investigated as other possible contributors to the cause of PSP.[21]\nAdditionally, the H2 haplotype, combined with vascular dysfunction, seems to be a factor of vascular progressive supranuclear palsy.[22]\nAlthough there is a strong correlation between the H1 haplotype and PSP, the exact molecular mechanism remains unclear. Some individuals with PSP-RS have reported a family history of the disease, suggesting the possibility that genetic factors, such as the H1 haplotype, may contribute to inherited susceptibility in certain cases.[20][23] The PSP-RS subtype is known for a buildup of the 4R tau protein, which does not dissolve properly and forms insoluble aggregates in the brain. In healthy brains, there is typically a balanced ratio of 3-repeat (3R) and 4-repeat (4R) tau isoforms, resulting from the regulated inclusion or exclusion of exon 10 on the MAPT gene.[20] Inclusion of exon 10 promotes the production of 4R tau, while its exclusion favors 3R tau.[20][23] In PSP-RS, this balance is disrupted. Certain genetic variations in MAPT, most notably the H1/H1 haplotype, are associated with increased inclusion of exon 10, leading to elevated levels of 4R tau relative to 3R tau.[20] The resulting overproduction of 4R tau is believed to contribute to the pathological accumulation of tau aggregates observed in PSP-RS.\nRisk factors for PSP are still being explored, but research has begun to uncover potential genetic, environmental, and biological contributors that may increase the likelihood of developing this condition. Associations between hypertension and increased risk for PSP development have been uncovered.[10] Additionally, ties to cerebrovascular disease and diabetes mellitus has been discovered, with type 2 diabetes being associated with increased brain atrophy and neurodegeneration.[10] Cerebrovascular disease may increase risk of vascular pathology and enhance disease burden through decreased blood flow and secondary injury.[10]\nBesides tauopathy, mitochondrial dysfunction seems to be a factor involved in PSP. Especially, mitochondrial complex I inhibitors (such as acetogenins and quinolines contained in Annonaceae plants, as well as rotenoids) are implicated in PSP-like brain injuries.[24]",
    "Diagnosis": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often used to diagnose PSP. MRI may show atrophy in the midbrain with preservation of the pons giving a \"hummingbird\" sign.[3][40]\nPSP is frequently misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease because they both involve slowed movements and gait difficulty, with PSP being one of a collection of diseases referred to as Parkinson plus syndromes. Both Parkinson's and PSP have an onset in late middle age and involve slowing and rigidity of movement. However, several distinguishing features exist. Tremor is very common with Parkinson's, but rare with PSP. Speech and swallowing difficulties are more common and severe with PSP and the abnormal eye movements of PSP are essentially absent with PD.[41] A poor response to levodopa, along with symmetrical onset can also help differentiate PSP from PD.[42]\nPSP can also be misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's disease because of the behavioral changes.[43]\nChronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) shows many similarities with PSP, because both share the following attributes:[44]\nBased on the pathological findings in confirmed cases of PSP, it is divided into the following categories:\nPSP-RS is the most common subtype of PSP. In PSP-P features of Parkinson's Disease overlap with the clinical presentation of PSP and follows a more benign course. In both PSP-P and PSP- PAGF distribution of abnormal tau is relatively restricted to the brain stem. Frontal PSP initially presents with behavioral and cognitive symptoms, with or without ophthalmoparesis and then evolve into typical PSP.[12] The phenotypes of PSP-P and PSP-PAGF are sometimes referred as the \"brain stem\" variants of PSP, as opposed to the \"cortical\" variants which present with predominant cortical features, including PSP-CBS, PSP-bvFTD, and PSP-PNFA.[47] Cerebellar ataxia as the predominant early presenting feature is increasingly recognized as a very rare subtype of PSP (PSP-C) which is associated with severe neuronal loss with gliosis and higher densities of coiled bodies in the cerebellar dentate nucleus.[48]\nThe \"humming-bird\" imaging feature, indicative of midbrain degeneration, supports early diagnosis of both PSP-RS and PSP-P.[4][49] One commonly used quantitative measure is the midbrain-to-pons area ratio, which is calculated by measuring the cross-sectional areas of the midbrain and pons on midsagittal MRI images.[14]In healthy individuals, the midbrain and pons are proportionally sized, but in PSP-RS, the midbrain undergoes significant atrophy while the pons remains relatively spared.[14][13][49][50] As a result, the ratio is markedly reduced in PSP-RS, distinguishing it from other neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy (MSA), and even PSP-P, which typically exhibit less pronounced midbrain atrophy.[14][13][49][50] To improve diagnostic specificity, the magnetic resonance parkinsonism index (MRPI) incorporates the midbrain-to-pons area ratio along with measurements of the widths of the middle and superior cerebellar peduncles.[14] The MRPI has been shown to enhance discrimination between PSP-RS and other forms of atypical parkinsonism.[14] Additional MRI findings associated with PSP-RS may include third ventricle enlargement, thinning of the superior cerebellar peduncles, and frontal lobe atrophy, all of which are consistent with the underlying tau pathology seen in the disease.[14] Brain atrophy in PSP-RS is generally symmetrical, which may correspond to the bilateral presentation of motor and cognitive symptoms.[17]\nPSP-RS is thought to follow a grading system that reflects the progressive nature of the disease.[20] In the early stages, atrophy affects midbrain structures such as the pons, and then progresses to involve the basal ganglia and pontine nuclei.[50] In later stages, the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the cerebral cortices exhibit cell death and atrophy.[50][49] PSP-RS is also associated with more widespread and severe cortical volume loss, particularly in the frontal pole, inferior frontal gyrus, globus pallidus, amygdala, and thalamus.[49] Additionally, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies show significant reductions in fractional anisotropy, a measure of white matter integrity, in the body of the corpus callosum, superior cerebellar peduncles, dentatorubrothalamic tract, and anterior thalamic radiation, indicating extensive white matter disruption in PSP-RS.[51][50]\nPositron emission tomography (PET) imaging has been used to detect tau accumulation in PSP-RS. The use of various tracers such as 18F-5105, 18F-FDDNP, 18F-THK523, 11C-PBB3 have shown increased binding in PSP-RS patients compared to healthy controls, reflecting elevated levels of 4R tau.[6] Brain scans called SPECT have been used to help diagnose different types of Parkinson-like conditions, including PSP-RS.[10] These scans show areas of reduced blood flow in the brain, but they aren't specific enough to clearly tell PSP-RS apart from other similar conditions like PSP-P or corticobasal syndrome (CBS).[10] Additionally, SPECT revealed greater perfusion deficits in PSP-RS than in PSP-P, although CBS showed the most frontal lobe deterioration overall.[10]\nThe table below summarizes key clinical, pathological, and imaging differences between the main subtypes of PSP, including PSP-RS, PSP-P, and other variant forms. While all subtypes share the underlying 4-repeat tau pathology characteristic of PSP, they differ in symptom onset, disease progression, anatomical vulnerability, and response to treatment. Patients with the Richardson variant of PSP tend to have an upright posture or arched back, as opposed to the stooped-forward posture of other Parkinsonian disorders, although PSP-Parkinsonism (see below) can demonstrate a stooped posture.[52] Early falls are also more common with PSP, especially with Richardson syndrome.[53]",
    "Treatment": "Management is only supportive as a cure for PSP is unknown. PSP cases are often split into two subgroups, PSP-RS and PSP-P, where a short-term response to levodopa can be obtained.[10][56] Dyskinesia is an occasional but rare complication of treatment.[57] Other variants have been described.[58][59][60][61] Botox can be used to treat neck dystonia and blepharospasm, but this can aggravate dysphagia.[62]\nTwo studies have suggested that rivastigmine may help with cognitive aspects, but the authors of both studies have suggested that larger studies are needed.[63][64] There is some evidence from small-scale studies that the hypnotic zolpidem may improve motor function and eye movements.[65][66]\nCurrent clinical trials focus on disease modifying treatments but there are currently no FDA approved disease modifying treatments for PSP-RS.[39] Recent trials have focused on therapies targeting the 4R tau accumulation in the brain of those with PSP-RS. These therapies include microtubule-stabilizing agents, tau gain-of-function therapies, and monoclonal antibodies.[10][39] These therapies are currently being tested in clinical trials.[10][39]\nPatients with PSP usually seek or are referred to occupational therapy, speech-language pathology for motor speech changes (typically a spastic-ataxic dysarthria), and physical therapy for balance and gait problems with reports of frequent falls.[67] There has been research in the use of robot-assisted gait training.[68] Evidence-based approaches to rehabilitation in PSP are lacking and, currently the majority of research on the subject consists of case reports involving only a small number of patients.[69]\nCase reports of rehabilitation programs for patients with PSP generally include limb-coordination activities, tilt-board balancing, gait training, strength training with progressive resistive exercises, and isokinetic exercises and stretching of the neck muscles.[67] While some case reports suggest that physiotherapy can offer improvements in balance and gait of patients with PSP, the results cannot be generalized across all PSP patients, as each case report followed only one or two patients.[67] The observations made from these case studies can be useful however, in helping to guide future research concerning the effectiveness of balance and gait training programs in the management of PSP.[39]\nIndividuals with PSP are often referred to occupational therapists to help manage their condition and to help enhance their independence. This may include being taught to use mobility aids.[70][71]  Due to their tendency to fall backwards, the use of a walker, particularly one that can be weighted in the front, is recommended instead of a cane.[70]  The use of an appropriate mobility aid helps to decrease the individual's risk of falls and makes them safer to ambulate independently in the community.[71]\nDue to their balance problems and irregular movements, individuals need to spend time learning how to safely transfer in their homes and in the community.[70] This may include rising from and sitting in chairs safely.[71]\nDue to the progressive nature of this disease, all individuals eventually lose their ability to walk and will need to progress to using a wheelchair.[70] Severe dysphagia often follows, and at this point death is often a matter of months.[72]",
    "Prognosis": "No effective treatment or cure has been found for PSP, although some of the symptoms can respond to nonspecific measures. The poor prognosis is predominantly attributed to the serious impact this condition has on the quality of life.[7] The average age at symptoms onset is 63 and survival from onset averages seven years with a wide variance.[73] Pneumonia is a frequent cause of death, often caused by accidental aspiration of food particles.[74]",
    "Society and culture": "There are several organizations around the world that support PSP patients and the research into PSP and related diseases, such as corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA).\nIn the 2020 American musical comedy-drama television series, Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist, the title character's father (Mitch Clarke, played by Peter Gallagher) has PSP.[87]"

    "Disease": "Prolidase deficiency",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Prolidase deficiency generally becomes evident during infancy, but initial symptoms can first manifest anytime from birth to young adulthood. The condition results in a very diverse set symptoms,[3] the severity of which can vary significantly between patients, depending on the degree to which prolidase activity is hampered by the individual underlying mutation(s) in each case. It is even possible, though rare, for affected individuals to be asymptomatic, in which case the disorder can only be identified through laboratory screening of the prospective patient and/or their extended family.[citation needed]\nOne of the signature features of PD is the elimination of high quantities of peptides through urine.[citation needed]\nIn addition, most of those affected exhibit persistent skin lesions (starting from a mild rash) or ulcers, primarily on the legs and feet, the formation of which normally begins during childhood.[3] Clinically, these, among other dermatological issues, represent the most distinguishing and most frequent symptoms.[4] These may never recede, potentially leading to severe infections that can, in the worst case, necessitate amputation.[citation needed]\nPD patients exhibit a weak immune system and markedly elevated vulnerability to infections in general, and particularly those of the respiratory system, leading some who suffer from PD to acquire recurrent lung disease. They may also have an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly), and on some occasions the spleen and liver may both be enlarged (hepatosplenomegaly).[3] Photosensitivity and hyperkeratosis have been associated with PD. Abnormal facial characteristics, consisting of pronounced eyes which are spaced far apart (hypertelorism), a high forehead, a compressed bridge of the nose or saddle nose, and a small lower jaw and chin (micrognathia), are also observed in the majority of cases.[3]\nThose affected by PD can also suffer intellectual disabilities (approx. 75% of recorded cases do) ranging from mild to severe – mental development during childhood may therefore progress more slowly.[citation needed]",
    "Causes": "Prolidase deficiency is the result of mutations on the PEPD gene which is located on the \"q\", i.e., long, arm of chromosome 19 at region 1, band 3,sub-band 11 (notated as 19q13.11).[5] This gene codes for the prolidase Enzyme, also known as peptidase-D.[3] At least 19 different mutations in the PEPD gene have been identified in individuals affected by the disorder.[6]\nProlidase is involved in the degradation of certain iminodipeptides (those containing C-terminal proline or hydroxyproline) formed during the breakdown of collagen, recycling the constituent amino acids (proline and hydroxyproline) and making them available for the cell to reuse – not least in the synthesis of new collagen. This recycling by prolidase, seen in the image above, is essential for maintaining proline-based systems in the cell, such as the collagen-rich extracellular matrix (ECM), which serves to physically support the structure of internal organs and connective tissues. Inadequate recycling due to a dysfunctional prolidase enzyme, caused by an appropriate mutation in the pertinent gene, leads to the deterioration of that support structure and therefore the connective tissue of the skin, capillaries, and the lymphatic tissue, as is the case in PD.[citation needed]\nIn particular, it has been proposed that the buildup of non-degraded dipeptides might induce programmed cell-death (apoptosis), whereafter the cell's contents would be expelled into the neighbouring tissue potentially resulting in inflammation and giving rise to the dermatological problems seen in PD. Similarly, a dysfunctional collagen metabolism will likely interfere with physiological remodelling processes of the extracellular matrix (which require collagen to be dynamically degraded and rebuilt), which might cause problems with the skin, as well.  [citation needed]\nThe mental impairment observed in those with PD might reasonably arise from complications involving neuropeptides, proteins that have an abundance of proline and are involved with communication in the brain.[citation needed]\nThe condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, meaning that both copies of the gene contained in every cell (both alleles) are mutated. Each of the parents of the person who suffers from an autosomal recessive disorder possesses one copy of the mutant gene, but they usually do not exhibit the signs and symptoms of the disorder, as their other copy is functional and can compensate for any deleterious effects.[3]",
    "Diagnosis": "PD diagnosis is based primarily on the presence and position of ulcers on the skin, as well as identifying particular protein markers in urine. To confirm the diagnosis, a blood test is required to measure prolidase activity.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "No curative treatment is available for prolidase deficiency at this time, although palliative treatment is possible to some extent.[citation needed]\nThe latter mainly focuses on treating the skin lesions through standard methods and stalling collagen degradation (or boosting prolidase performance, where possible), so as to keep the intracellular dipeptide levels low and give the cells time to resynthesise or absorb what proline they cannot recycle so as to be able to rebuild what collagen does degrade. Patients can be treated orally with ascorbate (a.k.a. vitamin C, a cofactor of prolyl hydroxylase, an enzyme that hydroxylates proline, increasing collagen stability), manganese (a cofactor of prolidase), suppression of collagenase (a collagen degrading enzyme), and local applications of ointments that contain L-glycine and L-proline. The response to the treatment is inconsistent between affected individuals.[7]\nA therapeutic approach based on enzyme replacement (administering functional prolidase) is under consideration.[8]\nDue to the weakened immune response in PD cases, it is also of paramount importance to keep any infections under control, often with heavy antibiotics.[citation needed]"

  {
    "Disease": "Properdin deficiency",
    "Signs and symptoms": "As a protein involved in the function of the immune system, no external changes in physiology or aberrant physical characteristics are expressed by individuals possessing a properdin deficiency. However, individuals that have a properdin deficiency do have a heightened susceptibility to bacterial infections, most notably caused by bacteria within the Neisseria genus, though there have also been studied cases of individuals with recurrent pneumococcus bacteremia as a result of Streptococcus pneumoniae, another species of bacteria from an entirely different phylum.[3][4] Due to a heightened susceptibility to Neisseria bacterium, individuals with properdin deficiency are far more likely to succumb to bacterial infection such as meningitis, resulting in inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, which causes severe headaches, fevers, and neck stiffness, and may result in further development of other meningococcal diseases and extreme complications such as sepsis.[5] Individuals with properdin deficiency are also more likely to catch the sexually transmitted disease, gonorrhea, as it is also caused by Neisseria bacterium, resulting in swelling, itching, pain, and formation of pus on the mucous membranes, including, but not limited to, the genitals, mouth, and rectum.[6]",
    "Diagnosis": "As mentioned before, there are no external indications of properdin deficiency, and as such, properdin deficiency can only be reliably detected by lab tests.[3] The typical tests for complement deficiencies, such as the measurement of C3 and C4, do not detect low levels of the absence of properdin.[2] These pathways are typically unaltered by any of the three types of properdin deficiencies, but even when they are affected, it is typically within normal levels and is not cause for concern.[2] Instead, histories of infection with anything from the Neisseria genus as well as family history can be indicators, but only specialist centers can screen for properdin deficiencies using immunochemical assays.[2] In particular, the use of ELISA proves to be one of the most effective methods of detecting properdin deficiency, as the average healthy male is expected to show properdin antigen levels of around 128.0 ELISA units/ml, and obligate carrier females (recall that properdin deficiency is an X-linked disease) tend to show an average of 45.6 units/ml.[3] An individual with properdin deficiency should, by definition, show very little to no properdin antigen levels at all, as they do not possess the requisite gene to produce the protein. While properdin deficiencies are rare, they have only been diagnosed in Caucasians, but no other race/ethnicity.[2]",
    "Treatment": "Pertaining to complement deficiencies, there is no cure and the treatments for complement deficiencies vary widely. The best course of action for management is usually for a patient to treat the complement deficiency as an immune deficiency and get immunized against the microbe associated with their deficiency (or best candidate).[7] As mentioned earlier, individuals with properdin deficiency are increasingly susceptible to Neisseria bacterium. Recent studies have indicated that individuals with properdin deficiency respond well when they are immunized with tetravalent polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine, which generates anti capsular antibodies and bactericidal anti-meningococcal activity against serotypes covered by the given vaccine.[2] The vaccine has been reported to lower the chances of reinfection by meningococci in individuals who have undergone the treatment, however the vaccine does not protect against group B meningococci and chemotherapy is recommended if full protection from all meningococci variants is desired.[2]",
    "Epidemiology": "Complement deficiencies are rare and currently not well characterized, so there has been difficulty detecting them. Currently, complement deficiencies only comprise approximately 2% of all primary immunodeficiency disorders. While the frequency of properdin deficiency has not been assessed worldwide, the risk of meningococcal infection in an individual with properdin deficiency has been calculated to be around 50%.[9]"

    "Disease": "Propionic acidemia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Propionic acidemia can vary in severity.[6] Severe propionic acidemia lead to symptoms already seen in newborns.[7] Symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, dehydration, acidosis, low muscle tone (hypotonia), seizures, and lethargy. The effects of propionic acidemia quickly become life-threatening.[citation needed]\nLong-term complications can include intellectual disability, autism,[8] chronic kidney disease,[9] cardiomyopathy, and prolonged QTc interval.[10]",
    "Diagnosis": "Elevated metabolites of propionic acid (for example, 3-hydroxypropionate, 2-methylcitrate, tiglylglycine, propionylglycine) found in blood and urine along with normal activity of biotinidase and normal levels of methylmalonic acid.[10]",
    "Treatment": "Patients with propionic acidemia should be started as early as possible on a low protein diet. In addition to a protein mixture that is devoid of methionine, threonine, valine, and isoleucine, the patient should also receive L-carnitine treatment and should be given antibiotics 10 days per month in order to remove the intestinal propiogenic flora.  The patient should have diet protocols prepared for them with a \"well day diet\" with low protein content, a \"half emergency diet\" containing half of the protein requirements, and an \"emergency diet\" with no protein content. These patients are under the risk of severe hyperammonemia during infections that can lead to comatose states.[13]\nLiver transplant is gaining a role in the management of these patients, with small series showing improved quality of life.[citation needed]",
    "Epidemiology": "Propionic acidemia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and is found in about 1 in 35,000[11] live births in the United States. The condition appears to be more common in Saudi Arabia,[14] with a frequency of about 1 in 3,000.[11] The condition also appears to be common in Amish, Mennonite and other populations with higher frequency of consanguinity.[15]"

    "Disease": "Pseudomyxoma peritonei",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of pseudomyxoma peritonei may include abdominal or pelvic pain and/or bloating, distension, digestive disorders, weight changes, increased girth, and infertility.[citation needed]",
    "Causes": "The primary tumor appears to arise from the MUC2-expressing goblet cells and most commonly from these cells in the appendix. The KRAS and p53 genes may be involved in the oncogenesis. It may be diagnosed with a range of conditions. While the majority of these cases are associated with appendiceal carcinomas,[3] other conditions may also be found, including disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis (DPAM), peritoneal carcinomas, several mucinous tumors (mucinous adenocarcinoma, mucinous cystadenoma, and mucinous cystadenocarcinoma), as well as other disease states.[4] Other primary sites that have been reported include colon, rectum, stomach, gallbladder, bile ducts, small intestine, urinary bladder, lung, breast, fallopian tubes, and the pancreas.",
    "Diagnosis": "This disease is often discovered during surgery for other conditions, e.g., hernia repair, following which an experienced pathologist can confirm the diagnosis. Advanced stages may present as tumors palpable on the abdomen or distention of the belly (\"jelly belly\" is sometimes used as a slang term for the condition).\nDue to the rarity of this disease, it is important to obtain an accurate diagnosis so that appropriate treatment may be obtained from a gastrointestinal cancer surgeon.  Diagnostic tests may include CT scans, examination of tissue samples obtained through laparoscopy, and the evaluation of tumor markers.\nIn most cases, a colonoscopy is unsuitable as a diagnostic tool, because, in most cases, appendix cancer invades the abdominal cavity but not the colon (however, spread inside the colon is occasionally reported). PET scans may be used to evaluate high-grade mucinous adenocarcinoma, but this test is not reliable for detecting low-grade tumors, because those do not take up the dye which shows up on scans.  New MRI procedures are being developed for disease monitoring, but standard MRIs are not typically used as a diagnostic tool.  Diagnosis is confirmed through pathology.[citation needed]\nThere is substantial debate regarding histopathologic classification of pseudomyxoma peritonei.[5] In 1995, Ronnett et al.[6] proposed separating pseudomyxoma peritonei cases into two diagnostic categories: adenoma (disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis, DPAM) or carcinoma (peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis, PMCA) with a third category reserved for cases with intermediate features. In this classification system, cases of DPAM were characterized by peritoneal lesions composed of abundant extracellular mucin containing scant simple to focally proliferative mucinous epithelium with little cytologic atypia or mitotic activity (in other words, most cells looked fairly normal and there was no evidence of mitosis which would indicate that cells were rapidly dividing), with or without an associated appendiceal mucinous adenoma. Cases of PMCA were characterized by peritoneal lesions composed of more abundant mucinous epithelium with the architectural and cytologic features of carcinoma (irregular cells, evidence that cells were rapidly dividing, and other criteria), with or without an associated primary mucinous adenocarcinoma. Bradley et al. (2007)[7] argued that continued use of non-malignant terms, i.e., adenoma, for those frequent cases with low-grade features (such as DPAM), is misleading because pseudomyxoma peritonei is a disease state that results from invasion of the abdominal cavity by cells with uncontrolled growth.  Bradley states that an adenoma, by definition, is a tumor confined to the appendiceal mucosa with absolutely no evidence of invasion beyond the muscularis mucosae.\nThe term mucinous adenocarcinoma is used in different contexts depending on the reference material used by the pathologist for disease classification.  For example, neoplasms characterized by high-grade features, invasive glands and or signet ring cells, are termed adenocarcinoma in pathology literature.[8] However, some pathologists (e.g., Odze and Goldblum, Surgical Pathology of the GI Tract, Liver, Biliary Tract and Pancreas, 2nd ed.) also use the term mucinous adenocarcinoma when referring to low-grade, well-differentiated tumors lacking high-grade features.  Low-grade mucinous adenocarcinoma is used by the American Joint Committee on Cancer and World Health Organization and is nearly or completely synonymous with the DPAM designation.[9] For low-grade mucinous adenocarcinoma, disease may be designated as \"benign\" because tumors do not invade deeply into tissue and rarely metastasize to parenchyma of organs; this designation may be misleading and confusing to the layperson because pseudomyxoma peritonei is not a harmless condition, fatal if untreated.  High-grade or poorly differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma has a generally poorer prognosis, though surgical treatment with heated intra-peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is yielding promising outcomes (see surgical treatment).\nImmunohistochemical features:",
    "Treatment": "Treatment is variable, both due to its rarity and to its frequently slow-growing nature. Treatment ranges from watchful waiting to debulking and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC, also called intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemotherapy, IPHC) with cytoreductive surgery.[11]\nThe standard of care for mucinous adenocarcinoma with clinical condition PMP[12] involves cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), performed by surgical oncologists who specialize in treating PMP. Some surgeons also apply early post-operative intraperitonial chemotherapy (EPIC), adjunct to surgical cytoreduction and HIPEC.  In situations where surgery is not required immediately, patients can be monitored via CT scans, tumor marker laboratory tests, and physical symptoms, to determine when, and if, surgery is warranted. Although some surgical procedures may be rather extensive, patients can and do recover from surgery, and the majority of these patients can and do live productive lives.[13]\nIn debulking, the surgeon attempts to remove as much tumor as possible. CRS or cytoreductive surgery involves surgical removal of the peritoneum and any adjacent organs which appear to have tumor seeding. Since the mucus tends to pool at the bottom of the abdominal cavity, it is common to remove the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, and parts of the large intestine. Depending upon the spread of the tumor, other organs might be removed, including but not limited to the gallbladder, spleen, and portions of the  small intestine and/or stomach.  For organs that cannot be removed safely (like the liver), the surgeon strips off the tumor from the surface.[14]\nChemotherapy (typically utilising the chemotherapeutic agent mitomycin C) may be infused directly into the abdominal cavity after cytoreductive surgery (surgery removing all visible disease) to kill remaining microscopic cancerous tumors and free floating cells. The heated chemotherapy (HIPEC) is perfused throughout the abdominal cavity for an hour or two as the last step in the surgery, or ports are installed to allow circulation and/or drainage of the chemicals for one to five days after surgery, known as early postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy (EPIC). EPIC may be given in multiple cycles for several months after surgery.[15]\nSystemic chemotherapy may be administered as additional or adjuvant treatment. Due to the increased availability of new chemotherapies developed for colorectal cancer patients, some patients have experienced stability in tumor growth with systemic chemotherapy. Systemic chemotherapy is generally reserved for patients with advanced disease, recurrent disease, or disease that has spread to the lymph nodes or distant sites.[citation needed]\nThis disease may recur following surgery and chemotherapy. Periodic post operative CT scans and tumor marker laboratory tests are used to monitor patients for disease progression.",
    "Epidemiology": "The overall incidence was previously estimated at 0.5 to 1 cases per 100,000 people per year.[16] Recent research in Europe indicates that the previous estimate of 1–2 persons per million may be underestimating the actual rate by approximately half, with the real incidence being approximately 3.2 persons per million, and the prevalence being 22 persons per million.[17] It is slightly more common in women than men (male:female ratio of approximately 1:1.3,[18][19]), although the actual ratio is difficult to identify due to potential misdiagnoses and possibly inclusion bias in reported studies. The median age at presentation is typically about 50 years with a range of 20–25 years, but PMP may strike persons of any age.[20][21]"

    "Disease": "Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The signs and symptoms of PAP include shortness of breath,[1] cough, low grade fever, and weight loss. Additionally, the clinical course of PAP is unpredictable. Spontaneous remission is recognized, and some patients have stable symptoms. Notably, some individuals with PAP may remain asymptomatic, with the condition only being detected incidentally during medical evaluations.[2] Death may occur due to the progression of PAP or of any underlying associated disease. Individuals with PAP are more vulnerable to lung infections such as nocardiosis, Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infection, or fungal infections.[1]",
    "Causes": "The abnormal accumulation of lipoproteinaceous compounds in PAP is due to impaired surfactant regulation and clearance. This is usually related to impaired alveolar macrophage function.[3] In adults, the most common cause of PAP is an autoimmunity to granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), a critical factor in development of alveolar macrophages. Decreased bioavailability of GM-CSF results in poor alveolar macrophages development and function, which results in accumulation of surfactant and related products.[3]\nSecondary causes of PAP are those in which the accumulation of lipoproteinaceous compounds is secondary to another disease process. This has been recognized in the settings of certain cancers (such as myeloid leukemia), lung infections, or environmental exposure to dusts or chemicals, such as nickel.[4]\nAlthough the cause of PAP was not originally understood, a major breakthrough in the understanding of the cause of the disease came by the chance observation that mice bred for experimental study to lack a hematologic growth factor known as granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) developed a pulmonary syndrome of abnormal surfactant accumulation resembling human PAP.[5]\nThe implications of this finding are still being explored, but significant progress was reported in February 2007.  Researchers in that report discussed the presence of anti-GM-CSF autoantibodies in patients with PAP, and duplicated that syndrome with the infusion of these autoantibodies into mice.[6]\nFamilial or sporadic inactivating mutations in one of the two parental GATA2 genes produces an autosomal dominant disorder termed GATA2 deficiency.  The GATA2 gene produces the GATA2 transcription factor which is critical for the embryonic development, maintenance, and functionality of blood-forming, lympathic-forming, and other tissue-forming cells. Individuals with a single GATA2 inactivating mutation present with a wide range of disorders including pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. GATA2 mutation-based pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is associated with normal levels of GM-CSF and commonly improves or is avoided in afflicted individuals who successfully receive a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.[7][8]",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of PAP is made using a combination of a person's symptoms, chest imaging, and microscopic evaluation of lung washing/tissue. Additional testing for serum anti-GM-CSF antibodies are helpful for confirmation.[11]\nAlthough both the symptoms and imaging findings are stereotypical and well-described, they are non-specific and indistinguishable from many other conditions. For example, chest x-ray may show alveolar opacities, and a CT may show a crazy paving lung pattern, both of which are seen more commonly in numerous other conditions.[12]  Thus, the diagnosis primarily depends on the pathology findings.[citation needed]\nLung washings or tissue for histopathologic analysis are most commonly obtained using bronchoalveolar lavage and/or lung biopsy.[13] Characteristic biopsy findings show filling of the alveoli (and sometimes terminal bronchioles) with an amorphous eosinophilic material, which stains strongly positive on PAS stain and the PAS diastase stain. The surrounding alveoli and pulmonary interstitium remain relatively normal.[14] Electron microscopy of the sample, although not typically performed due to impracticality, shows lamellated bodies representing surfactant.[15]  An alternative diagnosis with similar histomorphologic findings is Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.[15]\nLung washings characteristically yield a fluid which is \"milky\"composition. Under the microscope, samples show 20-50 micrometer PAS-positive globules on a background of finely granular or amorphous PAS-positive material. There is typically a low numbers of macrophages and inflammatory cells (although this is variable).[14][15]",
    "Treatment": "The standard treatment for PAP is whole-lung lavage[16][17][18] and supportive care.[19][20][21] This procedure is performed under general anesthesia, in which one lung is pumped with oxygen (ventilated lung), and the other lung (non-ventilated lung) is filled repeatedly with a warm saline solution and drained, removing any proteinaceous effluent along with it.[22] This process may be repeated up to 40 times depending on the severity of the patient's condition; a 2016 survey of 20 centers found that the mean lavage volume was 15.4 liters.[23] Whole-lung lavage is generally effective at improving PAP symptoms, often for a prolonged period of time.[24]\nOther treatments still being studied include subcutaneous and inhaled GM-CSF, and rituximab, an intravenous infusion that works to stop the production of the autoantibodies responsible for autoimmune PAP.[19][20][21][25] Lung transplantation has been performed in individuals with the various forms of PAP; however, this is often only used when all other treatment options have failed and significant lung damage has developed due to the risks, complications, or recurrence of PAP following transplantation.[21][25][26] As of 2022, methionine oral supplementation has been tested on patients with methionine tRNA synthetase-related PAP and has strong evidence of its efficacy on these patients.[27]",
    "Epidemiology": "The disease is more common in males and in tobacco smokers.[citation needed]\nIn a recent epidemiologic study from Japan,[28]  Autoimmune PAP has an incidence and prevalence higher than previously reported and is not strongly linked to smoking, occupational exposure, or other illnesses. Endogenous lipoid pneumonia and non-specific interstitial pneumonitis has been seen prior to the development of PAP in a child.[29]"

    "Disease": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Dyspnea (breathlessness) is the most common symptom associated with PAH and also usually the first symptom, with 98% of people experiencing dyspnea at the time of diagnosis.[2] Fatigue, lightheadedness, palpitations, chest pain are also present.[1][2] Late findings include near-syncope or syncope (fainting). As PAH progresses and chronically elevated pulmonary arterial pressures result in right heart failure; swelling of the legs and other areas of the body (edema), fluid buildup in the abdomen (ascites) develop as late symptoms.[2]\nFindings on physical exam indicating right heart failure may be present, including a loud P2 heart sound (the sound from the pulmonic valve closing), a heart murmur indicating tricuspid regurgitation or an elevated jugular venous pressure.[2][1]\nThe WHO introduced a functional classification in PAH which is used to estimate disease severity as well as response to treatment. WHO class 1 is characterized by no limitations with usual physical activity. Class 2 involves discomfort with physical activity and mild limitations. Class 3 disease involves a marked limitation with physical activity and symptoms being present with light activities. Class 4 disease involves severe symptoms with almost any physical activity and symptoms being present at rest.[4]",
    "Causes": "The cause of PAH is unknown. Idiopathic PAH (WHO group 1.1) is not associated with an underlying disease or exposure.[2] It is estimated that 39-46% of those with PAH have the idiopathic variant.[2]\nGroup 1.2 PAH includes the variants that are heritable. Genetic variants or mutations in bone morphogenic protein receptor 2 (BMPR2) account for approximately 75-80% of cases of heritable PAH.[1][2] BMPR2 mutations are also seen in 20% of idiopathic PAH.[1] BMPR2 is a protein involved in endothelial cell (cells that line blood vessels) proliferation and remodeling. Other types of genes coding for proteins involved in BMPR2 signaling have also been implicated as causes of heritable PAH, such as activin A receptor type-2-like-1 ACVRL1, Endoglin (ENG), SMAD genes encoding for SMAD transcription factors involved in downstream BMPR2 signaling and cell growth including Smad1, Smad4 and Smad9.[1] KCNK3 encodes for a potassium channel which regulates membrane potential across cells thus controlling vascular tone. Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 4 (E1F2AK4) is mutated causes heritable pulmonary veno-occlusive disease and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis.[7]\nGroup 1.3 PAH includes disease that is due to drug or toxin exposures. Methamphetamines, the chemotherapeutic dasatinib and the appetite suppressant and diet drug fenfluramine are associated with PAH.[2]\nGroup 1.4 PAH is disease that is associated with underlying disease. Group 1.4.1 is associated with connective tissue disorders including scleroderma (with scleroderma being the most common disorder with an estimated 8-19% of scleroderma patients having PAH), lupus, mixed connective tissue disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjogren's syndrome.[2] Group 1.4.2 is associated with HIV, group 1.4.3 associated with portal hypertension (commonly due to liver cirrhosis), group 1.4.4 associated with congenital heart disease, and 1.4.5 associated with schistosomiasis. In areas where schistosomiasis is prevalent, PAH due to schistosomiasis is believed to be the most prevalent variant of PAH. It is estimated that 5-8% of people with schistosomiasis with liver fibrosis have PAH.[2]\nGroup 1.5 PAH is the variant of PAH that is responsive to vasodilators (calcium channel blockers). The response to vasodilation by definition includes a decrease in the pulmonary arterial pressure of 10 mmHg or more to less than 40 mmHg without a decline in the cardiac output upon infusion of nitrous oxide(vasodilator) during the right heart catheterization. Vasodilator responsive PAH is estimated to be 6.8% of PAH patients in one study, and it is associated with a more favorable prognosis.[2]\nGroup 1.6 PAH includes PAH with features of venous or capillary involvement and is thought to comprise 5-10% of PAH cases. Two conditions, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis comprise this category. The subcategory is characterized by severe hypoxemia, capillary congestion and prominent post-capillary venule thickening.[2]\nGroup 1.7 PAH, with an estimated 0.18% prevalence, is persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. This results when the circulation does not transition from fetal to newborn configuration, leaving a patent ductus arteriosus and patent foramen ovale with left to right shunting exposing the pulmonary circulation to high pressures. PAH due to persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn has a 7.6% mortality at 1 year.[2]\nPeople may sometimes have PAH belonging to more than one sub-category.[1]",
    "Diagnosis": "Echocardiography is the preferred screening test in the diagnosis of PAH as it accurately estimates pulmonary pressures.[1] Other causes of pulmonary hypertension, such as left heart disease (WHO group 2), pulmonary hypertension due to lung disease (such as COPD)(WHO group 3) and pulmonary hypertension due to chronic blood clots in the pulmonary arteries (WHO group 4) need to be ruled out.[1] Some tests which are commonly used include a CT scan of the chest, ventilation perfusion scan or a CT angiography (to rule out pulmonary hypertension due to chronic blood clots), pulmonary function test, and a cardiac MRI. Cardiac MRI is the preferred test to evaluate right ventricular structure and function in PAH. Pulmonary function testing in PAH may show an obstructive or restrictive defect, and the diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (used as a surrogate for gas exchange in the alveoli) is reduced.[1]\nA sleep study helps to rule out sleep disordered breathing, such as sleep apnea, which may contribute to PAH.[1]\nThe N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT pro-BNP) may be monitored in those with PAH and is prognostic.\nA right heart catheterization to measure right heart pressure is required for the diagnosis of PAH. PAH is definitively diagnosed with a right heart catheterization showing a mean pulmonary arterial pressure greater than 20 mmHg at rest, with a pulmonary vascular resistance being 3 Woods Units or greater (indicative of pulmonary hypertension in the pre-capillary vasculature; the arteries and arterioles), and a pulmonary artery wedge pressure being less than 15 mmHg (excluding post-capillary pulmonary hypertension; elevated pressures distal to the pulmonary capillary bed which may be seen in left heart disease). Inhaled nitric oxide (a potent vasodilator) or other vasodilators (adenosine, prostaglandin I2) are infused during the right heart catheterization to see if the PAH is responsive to vasodilators which may guide treatment decisions (use of calcium channel blockers).[2][1]\nVarious clinical tests, such as the 6-minute walk test (the distance a person is able to walk in 6 minutes) are used prognostically as well as to assess response to treatment.[1][2]",
    "Treatment": "Supportive care in those with PAH involves using diuretics as needed for fluid overload, supplemental oxygen for hypoxemia, following a low sodium diet, an exercise program (such as walking), and routine immunizations. Vasoconstricting medications (frequently found in cough, cold and sinus formulations) should be avoided. Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation programs may be used for symptom control, patient education and counselling.[1]\nAnticoagulation, once universally used for PAH, is now indicated in idiopathic PAH, and its use is evaluated based on patient factors.[1]\nDisease specific therapy for PAH has improved disease free survival, symptom scores and mortality. Treatments consist of targeting the various aberrant pathways involved in the disease. For those with moderate to severe disease, dual therapy targeting at least 2 different disease specific pathways is indicated. Dual therapy is associated with greater mortality and disease free survival benefits over monotherapy.[1][2]\nPDE5 inhibitors (including sildenafil and tadalafil are used to dilate blood vessels by inhibiting the degradation of Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). cGMP inhibits pulmonary artery smooth muscle proliferation and causes pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell relaxation, thus acting as a vasodilator.[2]\nRiociguat also causes vasodilation by stimulating cGMP production.[2]\nEndothelin receptor antagonists cause vasodilation as well by blocking the action of the potent vasoconstrictor and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation activator endothelin-1. Bosentan inhibits endothelin-1 by blocking its action at the ETA and ETB receptors. Ambrisentan and sitaxsentan block endothelin-1 activity by selectively blocking the ETA receptor.[1][4]\nProstacyclins and prostacyclin agonists also cause vasodilation and also inhibit platelet aggregation. Epoprostenol, treprostinil and iloprost act as prostacyclin I2 (PGI2) analogues by binding to and activating the prostacyclin receptor to cause vasodilation. PGI2 activates adenylate cyclase to convert adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), cAMP inhibits proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the pulmonary artery walls, and causes relaxation of smooth muscle cells thus acting as a vasodilator. Selexipag acts as a PGI2 receptor agonist to also activate adenylate cyclase. Epoprostenol and treprostinil are given as continuous intravenous infusions. Treprostinil is also available as an inhaled form, as is iloprost.[2][1][4]\nIn those who have a sustained vasodilator response as determined during the right heart catheterization (approximately 10% of those with PAH are responders), long acting calcium channel blockers nifedipine, diltiazem or amlodipine are indicated.[1][4]\nIn disease that is refractory to medical therapy, an atrial septostomy may be used palliatively or as a bridge to lung transplantation.[1]",
    "Prognosis": "Five year survival in those with PAH was only 34%, but this has improved since the early 2000s when disease specific therapy was introduced. In 2010, survival was 86%, 69%, and 61% at 1, 3 and 5 years respectively. Heritable PAH is associated with an earlier disease onset, more severe hemodynamic features, and a reduced response to therapy as compared to idiopathic PAH.[2] In those with scleroderma associated PAH, 3 year survival is 56% as compared to 94% in those with scleroderma without PAH.[2] Those with PAH responding to vasodilators have a better prognosis.[2]\nPAH is associated with right heart failure and death (with a mortality rate of 13-17%) in pregnant women. It is recommended that women with PAH who may become pregnant use contraception. Estrogen containing contraceptives should be avoided due to the risk of blood clots.[2]",
    "Epidemiology": "The prevalence of PAH is estimated to be 25 cases per 1 million people in Western countries.[1] PAH is more common in women, the ratio of females to males affected by PAH is 1.7 to 1.[4] Others have estimated that the prevalence of PAH related to congenital heart disease is 25 cases per 1 million people.[1]"

    "Disease": "Pulmonary hypertension",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The symptoms of pulmonary hypertension include the following:[2][13][16]\nLess common signs/symptoms include a non-productive cough and exercise-induced nausea and vomiting.[13] Coughing up of blood may occur in some patients, particularly those with specific subtypes of pulmonary hypertension such as heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension, Eisenmenger syndrome, and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.[17] Pulmonary venous hypertension typically presents with shortness of breath while lying flat or sleeping (orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea), while pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) typically does not.[18]\nOther typical signs of pulmonary hypertension include an accentuated pulmonary component of the second heart sound, a right ventricular third heart sound, and parasternal heave indicating a hypertrophied right ventricle. Signs of systemic congestion resulting from right-sided heart failure include jugular venous distension, ascites, and hepatojugular reflux.[13][16][19] Evidence of tricuspid insufficiency and pulmonic regurgitation is also sought and, if present, is consistent with the presence of pulmonary hypertension.[13][16][20]",
    "Causes": "Pulmonary hypertension is a pathophysiologic condition with many possible causes. Indeed, this condition frequently accompanies severe heart or lung conditions.[13] A 1973 World Health Organization meeting was the first attempt to classify pulmonary hypertension by its cause, and a distinction was made between primary PH (resulting from a disease of the pulmonary arteries) and secondary PH (resulting secondary to other, non-vascular causes). Further, primary PH was divided into the \"arterial plexiform\", \"veno-occlusive\", and \"thromboembolic\" forms.[21] In 1998, a second conference at Évian-les-Bains addressed the causes of secondary PH.[22] Subsequent third,[23] fourth,[11] and fifth (2013)[12] World Symposia on PAH have further defined the classification of PH.  The classification continues to evolve based on improved understanding of the disease mechanisms.[citation needed]\nMost recently in 2022, the WHO guidelines were updated by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and European Respiratory Society (ERS).[4] These guidelines are endorsed by the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, and provide the current framework for understanding and treatment of pulmonary hypertension.[4]\nMutations in several genes have been associated with this condition[24][25] these include bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (BMPR2) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 4 gene (EIF2AK4). 80% of familial pulmonary arterial hypertension and 20% of sporadic variants have mutations in BMPR2.[26] BMPR2 is involved in endothelial proliferation and remodeling. Other mutations associated with PAH include ACVRL1 (which encodes activin receptor–like kinase 1) and ENG encoding endoglin, two proteins which also participate in BMPR2 signaling.[26] The SMAD transcription factor family, including SMAD1, SMAD4, and SMAD9 are involved in signaling pathways downstream from BMPR2 and are also implicated in the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension.[26]",
    "Diagnosis": "In terms of diagnosing pulmonary hypertension, it has five major types, and a series of tests must be performed to distinguish pulmonary arterial hypertension from venous, hypoxic, thromboembolic, or unclear multifactorial varieties. PAH is diagnosed after exclusion of other possible causes of pulmonary hypertension.[16]\nA physical examination is performed to look for typical signs of pulmonary hypertension (described above),[56] and a detailed family history is established to determine whether the disease might be heritable.[57][58][59] A history of exposure to drugs such as benfluorex (a fenfluramine derivative), dasatinib, cocaine, methamphetamine, ethanol leading to cirrhosis, and tobacco leading to emphysema is considered significant.[16][60][12] Use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during pregnancy (particularly late pregnancy) is associated with an increased risk of the baby developing persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn.[12]\nIf pulmonary hypertension is suspected based on the above assessments, echocardiography is performed as the next step.[13][16][59] A meta-analysis of Doppler echocardiography for predicting the results of right heart catheterization reported a sensitivity and specificity of 88% and 56%, respectively.[61] Thus, Doppler echocardiography can suggest the presence of pulmonary hypertension, but right heart catheterization (described below) remains the gold standard for diagnosis of PAH.[13][16]\nEchocardiography can also help to detect congenital heart disease as a cause of pulmonary hypertension.[13]\nIf the echocardiogram is compatible with a diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension, common causes of pulmonary hypertension (left heart disease and lung disease) are considered, and further tests are performed accordingly. These tests generally include electrocardiography (ECG), pulmonary function tests including lung diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide and arterial blood gas measurements, X-rays of the chest and high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scanning.[13][16][59][62]\nIf heart disease and lung disease have been excluded, a ventilation/perfusion scan is performed to rule out CTEPH. If unmatched perfusion defects are found, further evaluation by CT pulmonary angiography, right heart catheterization, and selective pulmonary angiography is performed.[13][59]\nSigns of pulmonary hypertension on CT scan of the chest are:\nAlthough pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) can be estimated based on echocardiography,[64] pressure measurements with a Swan-Ganz catheter inserted through the right side of the heart provide the most definite assessment.[42] Pulmonary hypertension is defined as a mean PAP of at least 20 mm Hg (3300 Pa) at rest, and PAH is defined as precapillary pulmonary hypertension (i.e. mean PAP ≥ 20 mm Hg with pulmonary arterial occlusion pressure [PAOP] ≤ 15 mm Hg and pulmonary vascular resistance [PVR] > 3 Wood Units).[59] PAOP and PVR cannot be measured directly with echocardiography. Therefore, diagnosis of PAH requires right-sided cardiac catheterization. A Swan-Ganz catheter can also measure the cardiac output; this can be used to calculate the cardiac index, which is far more important in measuring disease severity than the pulmonary arterial pressure.[13][65]\nMean PAP (mPAP) should not be confused with systolic PAP (sPAP), which is often reported on echocardiogram reports. A systolic pressure of 40 mm Hg typically implies a mean pressure of more than 25 mm Hg. Roughly, mPAP = 0.61•sPAP + 2.[66] Due to the invasive nature of this procedure, the use of computational fluid dynamics-based hemodynamic indices has been postulated.[67][68]\nFor people considered likely to have PAH based on the above tests, the specific associated condition is then determined based on the physical examination, medical/family history and further specific diagnostic tests (for example, serological tests to detect underlying connective tissue disease, HIV infection or hepatitis, ultrasonography to confirm the presence of portal hypertension, echocardiography/cardiac magnetic resonance imaging for congenital heart disease, laboratory tests for schistosomiasis, and high-resolution CT for PVOD and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis). Routine lung biopsy is discouraged in patients with PAH because of the risk to the patient and because the findings are unlikely to alter the diagnosis and treatment.[13][29][59]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment of pulmonary hypertension is determined by whether the PH is arterial, venous, hypoxic, thromboembolic, or miscellaneous. If it is caused by left heart disease, the treatment is to optimize left ventricular function by the use of medication or to repair/replace the mitral valve or aortic valve.[69] Patients with left heart failure or hypoxemic lung diseases (groups II or III pulmonary hypertension) should not routinely be treated with vasoactive agents including prostanoids, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, or endothelin antagonists, as these are approved for the different condition called primary pulmonary arterial hypertension.[70] To make the distinction, doctors at a minimum will conduct cardiac catheterization of the right heart, echocardiography, chest CT, a seven-minute walk test, and pulmonary function testing.[70] Using treatments for other kinds of pulmonary hypertension in patients with these conditions can harm the patient and wastes substantial medical resources.[70]\nHigh-dose calcium channel blockers are useful in only 5% of IPAH patients who are vasoreactive by Swan-Ganz catheter. Calcium channel blockers have been largely misused, being prescribed to many patients with non-vasoreactive PAH, leading to excess morbidity and mortality.[20] The criteria for vasoreactivity have changed. Only those patients whose mean pulmonary artery pressure falls by more than 10 mm Hg to less than 40 mm Hg with an unchanged or increased cardiac output when challenged with adenosine, epoprostenol, or nitric oxide are considered vasoreactive.[71] Of these, only half of the patients are responsive to calcium channel blockers in the long term.[72]\nSeveral agents have recently been introduced for primary and secondary PAH. The trials supporting the use of these agents have been relatively small, and the only measure consistently used to compare their effectiveness is the \"six-minute walk test\". Many have no data on mortality benefit or time to progression.[73]\nSotatercept (Winrevair) was approved for medical use in the United States in March 2024.[74]   Keros Therapeutics has decided to end a mid-stage trial of its experimental treatment, cibotercept, after identifying safety concerns, including fluid buildup around the heart in patients with PAH.[75] Keros had aimed to compete with Merck's FDA-approved PAH drug, Sotatercept.\nExercise-based rehabilitation\nA 2023 Cochrane review found that exercise-based rehabilitation may lead to a large increase in exercise capacity and an improvement in health related quality of life, without significantly increasing adverse events.[76]\nMany pathways are involved in the abnormal proliferation and contraction of the smooth muscle cells of the pulmonary arteries in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Three of these pathways are important since they have been targeted with drugs – endothelin receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors, and prostacyclin derivatives.[77]\nProstacyclin (prostaglandin I2) is commonly considered the most effective treatment for PAH. Epoprostenol (synthetic prostacyclin) is given via continuous infusion that requires a semi-permanent central venous catheter. This delivery system can cause sepsis and thrombosis. Prostacyclin is unstable and therefore has to be kept on ice during administration. Since it has a half-life of 3 to 5 minutes, the infusion has to be continuous, and interruption can be fatal.[78] Other prostanoids have therefore been developed. Treprostinil can be given intravenously or subcutaneously, but the subcutaneous form can be very painful. An increased risk of sepsis with intravenous Remodulin has been reported by the CDC. Iloprost is also used in Europe intravenously and has a longer half-life. Iloprost was the only inhaled form of prostacyclin approved for use in the US and Europe until the inhaled form of treprostinil was approved by the FDA in July 2009.[79]\nModerate-quality evidence suggests that endothelin receptor antagonists improve exercise capacity and decrease symptom severity.[80] The dual (ETA and ETB) endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan was approved in 2001. Macitentan is another ETA and ETB dual endothelin receptor blocker that is used.[26] Sitaxentan (Thelin) was approved for use in Canada, Australia, and the European Union,[81] but not in the United States. In 2010, Pfizer withdrew sitaxentan worldwide because of fatal liver complications.[82] A similar drug, ambrisentan (which is a ETA endothelin receptor blocker) is sold under the brand name Letairis in the US by Gilead Sciences.[83]\nThe US FDA approved sildenafil, a selective inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), for the treatment of PAH in 2005. It is marketed for PAH as Revatio. In 2009, they also approved tadalafil, another PDE5 inhibitor, marketed under the name Adcirca.[84] PDE5 inhibitors are believed to increase pulmonary artery vasodilation, and inhibit vascular remodeling, thus lowering pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance.[85]\nTadalafil is taken orally, as well as sildenafil, and it is rapidly absorbed (serum levels are detectable at 20 minutes). The T1/2 (biological half-life) hovers around 17.5 hours in healthy subjects.[86] Moreover, if we consider pharmacoeconomic implications, patients that take tadalafil would pay two-thirds of the cost of sildenafil therapy.[87] However, there are some adverse effects of this drug such as headache, diarrhea, nausea, back pain, dyspepsia, flushing, and myalgia.[88]\nThe combination medication macitentan/tadalafil (Opsynvi) was approved for medical use in Canada in October 2021,[89] and in the United States in March 2024.[90][91]\nSoluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) is the intracellular receptor for NO. As of April 2009[update], the sGC activators cinaciguat and riociguat were undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of PAH.[92]\nAtrial septostomy is a surgical procedure that creates a communication between the right and left atria. It relieves pressure on the right side of the heart, but at the cost of lower oxygen levels in blood (hypoxemia). Lung transplantation replaces a chronic condition with the ongoing need for treatment.[93] There is a post-surgical median survival of just over five years.[94]\nPulmonary thromboendarterectomy (PTE) is a surgical procedure that is used for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. It is the surgical removal of an organized thrombus (clot) along with the lining of the pulmonary artery; it is a challenging, major procedure that is currently performed in a few select centers.[95]\nEstablished clinical practice guidelines dictate the frequency of pulmonary nodule evaluation and surveillance,[70][96]\npatients are normally monitored through commonly available tests such as:[citation needed]",
    "Prognosis": "PAH is considered a universally fatal illness, although survival time may vary between individuals. The prognosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (WHO Group I) has an untreated median survival of 2–3 years from time of diagnosis, with the cause of death usually being right ventricular failure (cor pulmonale).[98] The survival time is variable and depends on many factors.[99] A recent outcome study of those patients who had started treatment with bosentan (Tracleer) showed that 89% of patients were alive at 2 years.[100] With new therapies, survival rates are increasing. For 2,635 patients enrolled in The Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-term Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Disease Management (REVEAL Registry) from March 2006 to December 2009, 1-, 3-, 5-, and 7-year survival rates were 85%, 68%, 57%, and 49%, respectively. For patients with idiopathic/familial PAH, survival rates were 91%, 74%, 65%, and 59%.[101] Levels of mortality are very high in pregnant women with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (WHO Group I). Pregnancy is sometimes described as contraindicated in these women.[102][103][104]",
    "Epidemiology": "The epidemiology of IPAH is about 125–150 deaths per year in the U.S., and worldwide, the incidence is similar at 4 cases per million. However, in parts of Europe (France), indications are 6 cases per million of IPAH. Females have a higher incidence rate than males (2–9:1).[105] In 2021, approximately 192,000 people were estimated to have PAH.[106] Other forms of PH are far more common. In systemic scleroderma, the incidence has been estimated to be 8 to 12% of all patients;[107] in rheumatoid arthritis it is rare.[108] However, in systemic lupus erythematosus it is 4 to 14%,[109] and in sickle cell disease, it ranges from 20 to 40%.[110] Up to 4% of people who develop a pulmonary embolism go on to develop chronic thromboembolic disease including pulmonary hypertension.[41] A small percentage of patients with COPD develop pulmonary hypertension with no other disease to explain the high pressure.[111] On the other hand, obesity-hypoventilation syndrome is very commonly associated with right heart failure due to pulmonary hypertension.[112]"

    "Disease": "Purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency",
    "Signs and symptoms": "In addition to the symptoms associated with immunodeficiency, such as depletion of T-cells, decline of lymphocyte activity, and an abrupt proliferation of both benign and opportunistic infections—PNP-deficiency is often characterized by the development of autoimmune disorders. lupus erythematosus, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura have been reported with PNP-deficiency.[2] Neurological symptoms, such as developmental decline, hypotonia, and mental retardation have also been reported.[citation needed]",
    "Causes": "The disorder is caused by a mutation of the purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) gene, located at chromosome 14q13.1.[3][4] This mutation was first identified by Eloise Giblett, a professor at the University of Washington, in 1975.[5] PNP is a key enzyme in the purine catabolic[6] pathway, and is required for purine degradation. Specifically, it catalyzes the conversion of inosine to hypoxanthine and guanosine to guanine (both guanine and hypoxanthine will be made into xanthine which will then become uric acid). A deficiency of it leads to a buildup of elevated deoxy-GTP (dGTP) levels resulting in T-cell toxicity and deficiency.[4][7] In contrast to adenosine deaminase deficiency (another deficiency of purine metabolism), there is minimal disruption to B cells.[8]\nPNP deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.[1] This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome (chromosome 14 is an autosome), and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is based on the clinical examination and on laboratory findings showing leukopenia, severe lymphopenia with low CD3, CD4, and CD8 counts and variable B cell function and immunoglobulin levels. Neutropenia has also been reported. Hallmark diagnostic markers of PNP deficiency include hypouricemia, complete or near complete absence of PNP activity in red blood cell lysate and increased urine or blood levels of inosine, guanosine and their deoxy forms. Diagnosis is confirmed by genetic screening of PNP.[citation needed]\nDifferential diagnosis includes aplastic anemias, SCID, severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency, ataxia-telangiectasia, and viral meningoencephalitis.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Supportive treatment, including intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii, and physical, occupational, and speech therapy, reduces the risk of infection and may encourage optimal neurologic development for patients.[citation needed]",
    "Epidemiology": "PNP deficiency is extremely rare. Only 33 patients with the disorder in the United States have been documented.[2] In the United Kingdom only two children have been diagnosed with this disorder in 1994 and 2008.[9]"

    "Disease": "Pycnodysostosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Pycnodysostosis causes the bones to be abnormally dense; the last bones of the fingers (the distal phalanges) to be unusually short; and delays the normal closure of the connections (sutures) of the skull bones in infancy, so that the \"soft spot\" (fontanelle) on top of the head remains widely open.[10] Because of the bone denseness, those with the syndrome suffer from fractures.[7]\nThose with the syndrome have brittle bones which easily break, especially in the legs and feet.\nOther abnormalities involve the head and face, teeth, collar bones, skin, and nails. The front and back of the head are prominent. Within the open sutures of the skull, there may be many small bones (called wormian bones). The midface is less full than usual. The nose is prominent. The jaw can be small. The palate is narrow and grooved. There will be delay in fall of milk teeth. The permanent teeth can also be slow to appear. The permanent teeth are commonly irregular and teeth may be missing (hypodontia). The collar bones are often underdeveloped and malformed. The nails are flat, grooved, and dysplastic. High bone density, acro-osteolysis and obtuse mandibular angle are the characteristic radiological findings of this disorder.[11]\nPycnodysostosis also causes problems that may become evident with time. Aside from the broken bones, the distal phalanges and the collar bone can undergo slow progressive deterioration. Vertebral defects may permit the spine to curve laterally resulting in scoliosis. The dental problems often require orthodontic care and cavities are common.\nPatients with PYCD are at a high risk of severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) due to upper airway obstructions.[12] OSA must be managed to prevent long term pulmonary complications.[12]\nAmongst infrequent complications, attention should be paid to maxillofacial anomalies. Snoring can be one of the presenting complaints and this needs early evaluation and management of obstructive sleep apnea if present to prevent long term pulmonary complications.",
    "Diagnosis": "Pycnodysostosis is one of those disorders which has a typical facial gestalt[16] and can be clinically identified in the majority of cases. Skeletal surveys can also aid in clinical diagnosis and characteristic features include high bone density, acro-osteolysis and obtuse mandibular angle. Molecular testing will be the final resort to confirm the diagnosis. Due to the limited number of exons of the CTSK gene that causes pycnodysostosis, a cheaper genetic testing called Sanger sequencing can be employed to confirm the diagnosis.",
    "Treatment": "The treatment of pycnodysostosis is currently based on symptomatic management and no active trials are in place for a curative approach. The comorbidities like short stature, fracture and maxillofacial issues can be easily managed when identified earlier, which can improve the quality of life of these individuals.\nManagement can include physical, medical, and psychological care including:[15]\nPatients are likely to have annual physical exams with doctors and specialists to monitor all symptoms.[15]",
    "Epidemiology": "Its incidence is estimated to be 1.7 per 1 million births.[4]"

    "Disease": "Rat-bite fever",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Symptoms are different for every person depending on the type of rat-bite fever with which the person is infected. Both spirillary and streptobacillary rat-bite fever have a few individual symptoms, although most symptoms are shared. Streptobacillosis is most commonly found in the United States and spirillary rat-bite fever is generally diagnosed in Africa. Rat-bite symptoms are visually seen in most cases and include inflammation around the open sore. A rash can also spread around the area and appear red or purple.[1] Other symptoms associated with streptobacillary rat-bite fever include chills, fever, vomiting, headaches, and muscle aches. Joints can also become painfully swollen and pain can be experienced in the back. Skin irritations such as ulcers or inflammation can develop on the hands and feet. Wounds heal slowly, so symptoms possibly come and go over the course of a few months.\nSymptoms associated with spirillary rat-bite fever include issues with the lymph nodes, which often swell or become inflamed as a reaction to the infection. The most common locations of lymph node swelling are in the neck, groin, and underarm.[2] Symptoms generally appear within two to ten days of exposure to the infected animal. It begins with the fever and progresses to the rash on the hands and feet within two to four days. The rash appears all over the body with this form but rarely causes joint pain.",
    "Causes": "Two types of Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic bacteria can cause the infection.",
    "Diagnosis": "This condition is diagnosed by detecting the bacteria in skin, blood, joint fluid, or lymph nodes. Blood antibody tests may also be used.[3] To get a proper diagnosis for rat-bite fever, different tests are run depending on the symptoms being experienced.\nTo diagnosis streptobacillary rat-bite fever, blood or joint fluid is extracted and the organisms living in it are cultured. Diagnosis for spirillary rat bite fever is by direct visualization or culture of spirilla from blood smears or tissue from lesions or lymph nodes.[4]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment should begin with assessment and management of the bite wound. The wound should be well irrigated. Although rats and small rodents are rarely infected with rabies, the individual must seek medical attention for possible tetanus or rabies post-exposure prophylaxis. Antibiotic therapy should be started immediately as laboratory confirmation may take a few days. Once results are obtained, therapy can be adjusted according to the antimicrobial susceptibility. Lack of treatment is highly associated with an increased risk of death. [6]\nThe treatment for rat-bite fever is consistent regardless of the bacterial cause. Intravenous penicillin is traditionally the treatment for uncomplicated cases of rat-bite fever, however intravenous ceftriaxone may also be used.  The dose and duration of antibiotic treatment depends on the clinical presentation and severity. If the patient improves after 5-7 days, they may transition to oral penicillin, ampicillin, or amoxicillin to complete a 14 day course therapy. If allergic to penicillin, cephalosporins such as cephalexin may be used. If allergic to both penicillin and cephalosporins, doxycycline may be used. [6]\nWhen treating children, Penicillin G procaine can be administered intramuscularly, or penicillin G can be given intravenously for 7 to 10 days. In uncomplicated cases, the patient may switch to oral penicillin after completing a 5-day course of intravenous penicillin G to complete the full 10-day course of antibiotics. For those with severe allergic reactions to penicillin, doxycycline or streptomycin can be used as alternatives. In cases of endocarditis, high-dose intravenous penicillin G is required for at least 4 weeks. Streptomycin or gentamicin can also be utilized for initial therapy in severe infections, including endocarditis. [7]",
    "Prognosis": "When proper treatment is provided for patients with rat-bite fever, the prognosis is positive. Without treatment, the infection usually resolves on its own, although it may take up to a year to do so.[8] A particular strain of rat-bite fever in the United States can progress and cause serious complications that can be potentially fatal. Before antibiotics were used, many cases resulted in death. If left untreated, streptobacillary rat-bite fever can result in infection in the lining of the heart, covering over the spinal cord and brain, or in the lungs. Any tissue or organ throughout the body may develop an abscess.[9]",
    "Epidemiology": "Rat-bite fever (RBF) is a zoonotic disease.[10] It can be directly transmitted by rats, gerbils, and mice (the vectors) to humans by either a bite or scratch or it can be passed from rodent to rodent.[11] The causative bacterial agent of RBF has also been observed in squirrels, ferrets, dogs, and pigs.[12] The most common reservoir of the disease is rats because nearly all domestic and wild rats are colonized by the causative bacterial agent, Streptobacillus moniliformis. Most notably, the Black rat (Rattus rattus) and the Norwegian rat (Rattus norvegicus) are recognized as potential reservoirs due to their common use as laboratory animals or kept as pets.[12] The bacteria Streptobacillus moniliformis is found in the rat's upper respiratory tract. Most rats harbor the disease asymptomatically, and signs and symptoms rarely develop.[13] It is estimated that 1 in 10 bites from a rat will result in developing RBF.[14] A person is also at risk of acquiring the bacteria through touching contaminated surfaces with an open wound or mucous membrane[15] or ingestion of contaminated water or food by rodent feces, though this is referred to as Haverhill Fever (epidemic arthritic erythema). RBF is not a contagious disease. That is, it cannot be transferred directly from person to person.[15]\nResearchers are challenged in understanding the prevalence of RBF. One factor that limits the known number of cases of RBF in the United States is that it is not a reportable disease there.[16] RBF is classified as a notifiable disease, which means it is required by the state to be reported, however, the state is not mandated to provide that information to the United States Centers for Disease Control. Identification of RBF is also hindered due to the presence of two different etiological bacterial agents, Streptobacillus moniliformis and Spirillum minus.[17] RBF caused by Sp. minus is more commonly found in Asia and is termed Sodoku, whereas St. moniliformis is found more often in the United States and in the Western Hemisphere.[17] Although cases of RBF have been reported all over the world, the majority of cases that have been documented are caused by St. moniliformis primarily in the United States, where approximately 200 cases have been identified and reported.[16][18][19] Due to increasing population density, this illness is being seen more frequently, as humans have increased their contact with animals and the zoonotic diseases they carry.[20] Most cases of the disease have been reported from densely populated regions, such as big cities.[20] The populations at risk have broadened due to the fact that domestic rats have become a common household pet. In the United States it is estimated that children five years and younger are the most at risk, receiving 50% of the total exposure, followed by laboratory personnel and then pet store employees.[16][19] Other groups at increased risk are people over 65 years old, immunocompromised individuals, and pregnant women.[21]\nSymptoms of RBF include sudden high temperature fevers with rigors, vomiting, headaches, painful joints/arthritis. A red, bumpy rash develops in about 75% of subjects.  Symptoms of RBF can develop between three days and three weeks after exposure.[13] While symptoms differ between Streptobacillary and Spirillary RBF, both types exhibit an incubation period before symptoms manifest.[20][22] Due to its symptoms, RBF is often misdiagnosed by clinicians, leading to lingering symptoms and worsening conditions in patients; left untreated the mortality rate (death rate) of RBF is 13%.[16][23][24] Even when treated, RBF can lead to migratory polyarthralgia, persistent rash, and fatigue [13] which can persist for weeks to years after initial infection and treatment."

    "Disease": "Refsum disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Individuals with Refsum disease present with neurologic damage, cerebellar degeneration, and peripheral neuropathy. Most cases are symmetric (affecting the left and right sides of the body equally) and feature both motor and sensory nerve deficits with similar time of onset and rate of disease progression.[8] Onset is most commonly in childhood or adolescence with a progressive course, although periods of stagnation or remission do occur. Rarely, symptoms may not appear until adulthood.[8] Common symptoms include dry, scaly skin; difficulty hearing; variable (but typically significant) muscle weakness; anosmia, which is the loss of sense of smell; and eye problems, including retinitis pigmentosa, cataracts, and night blindness.[9][8] Cerebellar ataxia is also common but usually presents later in life than other symptoms.[8] In 80 percent of patients diagnosed with Refsum disease, sensorineural hearing loss has been reported. This is hearing loss as the result of damage to the inner ear or the nerve connecting ear to the brain.[10]\nApproximately 30% of patients with Refsum disease are known to have congenital malformations of bones. The metatarsal and metacarpal bones are the most commonly affected, often being shorter than normal. In theory, this might be the earliest observable symptom of Refsum disease, but such abnormalities are often nonspecific or too minor to be noticed.[8]\nRarely, patients with Refsum disease may develop a cardiac arrhythmia. There is evidence that the risk of cardiac problems may increase following an infection or catecholamine-related illness, but this is not firmly established.[8]",
    "Causes": "Refsum disease is a peroxisomal disorder caused by the impaired alpha-oxidation of branched chain fatty acids resulting in buildup of phytanic acid and its derivatives in the plasma and tissues. This may be due to deficiencies of phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase or peroxin-7 activity, encoded by the genes PHYH[11] and PEX7,[12] respectively. In at least 90% of cases, Refsum disease is caused by PHYH mutations.[1][8][13]\nPEX7 gene mutations can interrupt the peroxisomal transport of proteins as this gene codes for the peroxin-7 protein receptor. These mutations in the PEX7 gene generally lead to rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1, which impairs development of many parts of the body.[14] Refsum disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that it requires both copies of the mutation to inherit the disease.[8]",
    "Diagnosis": "Histopathologic examination of the skin from a suspected patient commonly shows hyperkeratosis, hyper-granulosis and acanthosis. The presence of cells in the basal and suprabasal layers of the epidermis containing variably sized vacuoles with accumulated lipids is pathognomonic for the disease.[15]\nAdult Refsum disease may be divided into the adult Refsum disease 1 and adult Refsum disease 2 subtypes. The former stems from mutations in the phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase (PAHX aka PHYH) gene, on the PHYH locus on chromosome 10p13.[1]  It was initially believed this was the sole mutation; however 55% of cases are now attributed to mutations in other genes.[16]\nRefsum disease 2 stems from mutations in the peroxin 7 (PEX7) gene.[1][13] The PEX7 gene is located in the region of chromosome 6q22-24, and mutations were found in patients presenting with accumulation of phytanic acid with no PHYH mutation.[14]\nAdult Refsum disease should not be confused with infantile Refsum disease, a peroxisome biogenesis disorder resulting from deficiencies in the catabolism of very long chain fatty acids and branched chain fatty acids (such as phytanic acid) and plasmalogen biosynthesis.[1][13]",
    "Treatment": "Since phytanic acid is not endogenously produced in the human body, individuals with Refsum disease are commonly placed on a phytanic-acid–restricted diet and avoid the consumption of fats from ruminant animals and certain fish, such as tuna, cod, and haddock.[9][17] Grass feeding animals and their milk are also avoided.[16] Recent research has shown that CYP4 isoform enzymes could help reduce the over-accumulation of phytanic acid in vivo.[18] Plasmapheresis is another medical intervention used to treat patients. This involves the filtering of blood to ensure there is no accumulation of phytanic acid.[16]"

    "Disease": "Reticular dysgenesis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "[6]",
    "Diagnosis": "Health professionals must look at a person's history, symptoms, physical exam and laboratory test in order to make a diagnosis. If the results show patients with low levels of lymphocytes, absence of granulocytes or absence of thymus then the patient may be suspected to have RD.[4]",
    "Treatment": "RD can only be treated temporarily through hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and cytokine therapy.[4][8][9]\nTransplantation of stem cells are taken from the bone marrow, peripheral blood or umbilical cord of healthy, matched donors.[10] Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) involves intravenous infusion of stem cells to those who have either a damaged bone marrow or defective immune system.[4][10] Transplantation is a simple process. Bone marrow product is infused through a central vein over a period of several hours.[10] The hematopoietic cells are able to go to the bone marrow through tracking mechanisms.[10] Patients who suffer from RD will now have more stem cells that can differentiate into immune cells.[citation needed]\nRecombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rGM-CSF) can be used as a temporary cure.[8] GM-CSF stimulates production of white blood cells.[8] This cure is commonly used in patients who are awaiting bone marrow transplantation.[8] Response to this cure can vary.[8] Those with a more severe combined immunodeficiency may have no response to this therapy.[8]",
    "Prognosis": "The survival range is estimated to be 3 days to 17 weeks without treatment.[8] Patients die due to bacterial or viral infections.[8] Aggressive treatment with antibiotics is required and bone marrow transplant is common.[8] Patients undergoing bone marrow transplant, specifically from a matched sibling, have a higher 5 year survival rate than those receiving a transplant from other donors.[10]"

    "Disease": "Retinoblastoma",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Retinoblastoma is the most intrusive intraocular cancer among children. The chance of survival and preservation of the eye depends fully on the severity. Retinoblastoma is extremely rare as there are only about 200 to 300 cases every year in the United States. Globally, only 1 in about 15,000 children have this malignancy, though rates continue to increase.[3]\nIntraocular malignancies are relatively more frequently treated than extraocular malignancies, likely due to a relatively earlier detection and subsequent treatment. Pediatricians may screen infants with annual vision tests, in which anomalies can be detected. During a red reflex test, light from an ophthalmoscope goes through transparent parts of the eye and reflects off the ocular fundus. If retinoblastoma is present, it may partially or fully impede light transversing this path. This may result in an abnormal red reflex or leucocoria, which can be a common indicator of retinoblastoma (when light is reflected by the tumor, the regular view of the red retina is blocked). The retinoblastoma may be visible as a whitish, translucent mass.[8] If the tumor has not spread and is contained within the eye, chances of successful treatment are favorable. If initial signs are ignored or diagnosis is significantly delayed, outcomes and prognosis worsen. The effects of retinoblastoma may spread outside the eye, sometimes resulting in proptosis. Retinoblastoma that has spread may be significantly more difficult to treat.[9]\nThe most common and obvious sign of retinoblastoma is an abnormal appearance of the retina as viewed through the pupil, the medical term for which is leukocoria, also known as amaurotic cat's eye reflex.[5] Other signs and symptoms include deterioration of vision, a red and irritated eye with glaucoma, and faltering growth or delayed development. Some children with retinoblastoma can develop a squint,[10] commonly referred to as \"cross-eyed\" or \"wall-eyed\" (strabismus). Retinoblastoma presents with advanced disease in developing countries and eye enlargement is a common finding.[11]\nDepending on the position of the tumors, they may be visible during a simple eye examination using an ophthalmoscope to look through the pupil. A positive diagnosis is usually made only with an examination under anesthetic (EUA). A white eye reflection is not always a positive indication of retinoblastoma and can be caused by light being reflected badly[12] or by other conditions such as Coats' disease.[13]\nThe presence of the photographic fault red eye in only one eye and not in the other may be a sign of retinoblastoma. A clearer sign is \"white eye\" or \"cat's eye\" (leukocoria).[14]",
    "Causes": "Mutation of genes, found in chromosomes, can affect the way in which cells grow and develop within the body.[15] Alterations in RB1 or MYCN can give rise to retinoblastoma.\nIn children with the heritable genetic form of retinoblastoma, a mutation occurs in the RB1 gene on chromosome 13. RB1 was the first tumor suppressor gene cloned.[15] Although RB1 interacts with over 100 cell proteins,[15] its negative regulator effect on the cell cycle principally arises from binding and inactivation of the transcription factor E2F, thus repressing the transcription of genes which are required for the S phase.[15]\nThe defective RB1 gene can be inherited from either parent; in some children, however, the mutation occurs in the early stages of fetal development. The expression of the RB1 allele is autosomal dominant with 90% penetrance.[16]\nInherited forms of retinoblastomas are more likely to be bilateral. In addition, inherited uni- or bilateral retinoblastomas may be associated with pineoblastoma and other malignant midline supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) with a dismal outcome; retinoblastoma concurrent with a PNET is known as trilateral retinoblastoma.[17] A 2014 meta-analysis showed that 5-year survival of trilateral retinoblastoma increased from 6% before 1995 to 57% by 2014, attributed to early detection and improved chemotherapy.[18]\nThe development of retinoblastoma can be explained by the two-hit model. According to the two-hit model, both alleles need to be affected, so two events are necessary for the retinal cell or cells to develop into tumors. The first mutational event can be inherited (germline or constitutional), which will then be present in all cells in the body. The second \"hit\" results in the loss of the remaining normal allele (gene) and occurs within a particular retinal cell.[19] In the sporadic, nonheritable form of retinoblastoma, both mutational events occur within a single retinal cell after fertilization (somatic events); sporadic retinoblastoma tends to be unilateral.\nSeveral methods have been developed to detect the RB1 gene mutations.[20][21]  Attempts to correlate gene mutations to the stage at presentation have not shown convincing evidence of a correlation.[22]\nNot all retinoblastoma cases are with RB1 inactivation. There are cases reported with only one RB1 mutation or even two functional RB1 alleles, which indicates other oncogenic lesions of retinoblastoma.[23] Somatic amplification of the MYCN oncogene is responsible for some cases of nonhereditary, early-onset, aggressive, unilateral retinoblastoma. MYCN can act as a transcription factor and promotes proliferation by regulating the expression of cell cycle genes.[24][25] Although MYCN amplification accounted for only 1.4% of retinoblastoma cases, researchers identified it in 18% of infants diagnosed at less than 6 months of age. Median age at diagnosis for MYCN retinoblastoma was 4.5 months, compared with 24 months for those who had nonfamilial unilateral disease with two RB1 gene mutations.[26]",
    "Diagnosis": "Screening for retinoblastoma should be part of a \"well baby\" screening for newborns during the first 3 months of life, to include:[27]\nThe two forms of the disease are a heritable form and nonheritable form (all cancers are considered genetic in that mutations of the genome are required for their development, but this does not imply that they are heritable, or transmitted to offspring). Approximately 40% of patients have a heritable form of retinoblastoma, carrying a mutation in the RB1 gene.[28] If no history of the disease exists within the family, the disease is labeled \"sporadic\", but this does not necessarily indicate that it is the nonheritable form. Bilateral retinoblastomas are commonly heritable, while unilateral retinoblastomas are commonly nonheritable.[citation needed]\nIn about two-thirds of cases,[29] only one eye is affected (unilateral retinoblastoma); in the other third, tumors develop in both eyes (bilateral retinoblastoma). The number and size of tumors on each eye may vary. In certain cases, the pineal gland or the suprasellar or parasellar region (or in very rare cases other midline intracranial locations) is also affected (trilateral retinoblastoma). The position, size, and quantity of tumors are considered when choosing the type of treatment for the disease.[citation needed]\nIf the eye examination is abnormal, further testing may include imaging studies, such as computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound.[30] CT and MRI can help define the structure abnormalities and reveal any calcium depositions. Ultrasound can help define the height and thickness of the tumor. Bone marrow examination or lumbar puncture may also be done to determine any metastases to bones or the brain.[citation needed]\nGross and microscopic appearances of retinoblastoma are identical in both hereditary and sporadic types. Macroscopically, viable tumor cells are found near blood vessels, while zones of necrosis are found in relatively avascular areas. Microscopically, both undifferentiated and differentiated elements may be present. Undifferentiated elements appear as collections of small, round cells with hyperchromatic nuclei; differentiated elements include Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes, Homer Wright rosettes,[31]  and fleurettes from photoreceptor differentiation.[32]\nIdentifying the RB1 gene mutation that led to a child's retinoblastoma can be important in the clinical care of  the affected individual and in the care of (future) siblings and offspring. It may run in the family.\nTraditional ultrasound B scan can detect calcifications in the tumour while high-frequency ultrasound B scan is able to provide higher resolution than the traditional ultrasound and determine the proximity of the tumour with front portion of the eye. MRI scan can detect high-risk features such as optic nerve invasion; choroidal invasion, scleral invasion, and intracranial invasion. CT scan is generally avoided because radiation can stimulate the formation of more eye tumours in those with RB1 genetic mutation.[37]",
    "Treatment": "The priority of retinoblastoma treatment is to preserve the life of the child, then to preserve vision, and then to minimize complications or side effects of treatment. The exact course of treatment depends on the individual case and is decided by the ophthalmologist in discussion with the paediatric oncologist.[40] Correct treatment also depends on the mutation type, whether it is a germline RB1 mutation, a sporadic RB1 mutation or MYCN amplification with functional RB1.[41] Children with involvement of both eyes at diagnosis usually require multimodality therapy (chemotherapy, local therapies).\nThe various treatment modalities for retinoblastoma includes:[40][42][43]",
    "Prognosis": "In the developed world, retinoblastoma has one of the best cure rates of all childhood cancers (95–98%), with more than 90% of sufferers surviving into adulthood. In the UK, around 40 to 50 new cases are diagnosed each year.[50] Good prognosis depends upon early presentation of the child in health facility.[51] Late presentation  is associated with a poor prognosis.[52] Survivors of hereditary retinoblastoma have a higher risk of developing other cancers later in life. About 5% of cases require enucleation.",
    "Epidemiology": "Retinoblastoma presents with cumulative lifetime incidence rate of one case of retinoblastoma per 18000 to 30000 live births worldwide.[53] A higher incidence is noted in developing countries, which has been attributed to lower socioeconomic status and the presence of human papilloma virus sequences in the retinoblastoma tissue.[54]\nAlmost 80% of children with retinoblastoma are diagnosed before three years of age and diagnosis in children above six years of age is extremely rare.[55] In the UK, bilateral cases usually present within 14 to 16 months, while diagnosis of unilateral cases peaks between 24 and 30 months."

    "Disease": "Retinopathy of prematurity",
    "Causes": "By the fourth month of pregnancy, the fetal retina has begun to develop vascularization. Such formation of blood vessels appears to be very sensitive to the amount of oxygen supplied, either naturally or artificially. In rare cases ROP has been found in some patients with a mutation in the NDP gene, which is normally associated with the more damaging Norrie disease.[3][4][5]\nVarious risk factors contribute to the development of ROP. They are:",
    "Diagnosis": "The stages of ROP disease have been defined by the International Classification of Retinopathy of Prematurity (ICROP).\nIn older patients, the appearance of the disease is less well described but includes the residua of the ICROP stages as well as secondary retinal responses.\nThe system used for describing the findings of active ROP is entitled The International Classification of Retinopathy of Prematurity (ICROP).[10] ICROP uses a number of parameters to describe the disease. They are location (zone) of the disease, the circumferential extent of the disease based on the clock hours, the severity (stage) of the disease and the presence or absence of \"Plus Disease\". Each aspect of the classification has a technical definition. This classification was used for the major clinical trials. It was revised in 2005.[11]\nThe zones are centered on the optic nerve. Zone I is the posterior zone of the retina, defined as the circle with a radius extending from the optic nerve to double the distance to the macula. Zone II is an annulus with the inner border defined by zone I and the outer border defined by the radius defined as the distance from the optic nerve to the nasal ora serrata. Zone III is the residual temporal crescent of the retina.[citation needed]\nThe circumferential extent of the disease is described in segments as if the top of the eye were 12 on the face of an analog clock, e.g. stage 1 from 4:00 to 7:00. (The extent is a bit less important since the treatment indications from the Early Treatment for ROP.)[12]\nThe Stages describe the ophthalmoscopic findings at the junction between the vascularized and avascular retina.[citation needed]\nPlus disease can be present as a major complicating factor at any stage. It is characterised by:\nThe most difficult aspect of the differential diagnosis may arise from the similarity of two other diseases:[citation needed]",
    "Prognosis": "Stages 1 and 2 do not lead to blindness. However, they can progress to the more severe stages. Threshold disease is defined as disease that has a 50% likelihood of progressing to retinal detachment. Threshold disease is considered to be present when stage 3 ROP is present in either zone I or zone II, with at least five continuous or eight total clock hours of disease, and the presence of plus disease.[22] Progression to stage 4 (partial retinal detachment), or to stage 5 (total retinal detachment), will result in substantial or total loss of vision for the infant.",
    "Epidemiology": "ROP prevalence varies, from 5 to 8% in developed countries with adequate neonatological facilities, to up to 30% in middle-income developing countries.[24]\nThere is increasing evidence that ROP and blindness due to ROP are now public health problems in the middle income countries of Latin America, Eastern Europe and the more advanced economies in South East Asia and the Middle east region. In these countries ROP is often the most common cause of blindness in children.[25][26] ROP is highly likely to become an increasing problem in India, China and other countries in Asia as these countries expand the provision of services for premature infants.\nThere is also evidence that the population of premature infants at risk of severe ROP varies depending on the level of neonatal intensive care being provided.[25] In countries with high development indices and very low neonatal mortality rates (e.g. North America, Western Europe), severe ROP is generally limited to extremely preterm infants i.e. those weighing less than 1 kg (2.2 lbs) at birth. At the other end of the development spectrum, countries with very low development indices and very high neonatal mortality rates (e.g. much of subSaharan Africa) ROP is rare as most premature babies do not have access to neonatal intensive care and so do not survive. Countries with moderate development indices are improving access to neonatal intensive care, and in these settings bigger, more mature babies are also at risk of severe ROP as neonatal care may be suboptimal. These findings have two main implications: firstly, much can be done in countries with moderate development indices to improve neonatal care, to reduce the risk of severe ROP in bigger babies and increase survival of extremely preterm infants, and secondly, in these settings bigger more mature babies need to be included in ROP programs and examined regularly so as to detect those babies developing ROP requiring treatment.\nIn 2012, the World Health Organization published data on rates of preterm birth and the number of premature babies born in different regions of the world.[27] This report contained three main findings:"

    "Signs and symptoms": "The most common symptoms are intellectual disability and recurrent seizures developing in infancy or early childhood. Typically, the seizures are resistant to treatment with anti-epileptic drugs. Other symptoms may include:[1][5]",
    "Causes": "The syndrome is caused by the loss of genetic material near the end of the long arm (q) of chromosome 14 . The break that causes the telomere(s) to be lost occurs near the end of the chromosome, and is called a constitutional ring. These rings arise spontaneously ( it is rarely inherited).[4][1][6][2]\nThe genetic abnormality occurs randomly in sperm or egg cells or it may occur in early embryonic growth, if it occurs during embryonic growth the ring chromosome may be present in only some of a person's cells.[medical citation needed]",

    "Disease": "Roberts syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The following is a list of symptoms that have been associated with Roberts syndrome:[citation needed]\nMortality is high among those severely affected by Roberts syndrome; however, mildly affected individuals may survive to adulthood[1][3][4]",
    "Diagnosis": "A clinical diagnosis of Roberts syndrome is made in individuals with characteristic prenatal growth retardation, limb malformations, and craniofacial abnormalities. The specific characteristics that are looked for in the clinical diagnosis are listed below.[citation needed]\nAn official diagnosis of Roberts syndrome relies on cytogenetic testing of the peripheral blood.[6]\nCytogenetic preparations that have been stained by either Giemsa or C-banding techniques will show two characteristic chromosomal abnormalities. The first chromosomal abnormality is called premature centromere separation (PCS) and is the most likely pathogenic mechanism for Roberts syndrome. Chromosomes that have PCS will have their centromeres separate during metaphase rather than anaphase (one phase earlier than normal chromosomes). The second chromosomal abnormality is called heterochromatin repulsion (HR). Chromosomes that have HR experience separation of the heterochromatic regions during metaphase. Chromosomes with these two abnormalities will display a \"railroad track\" appearance because of the absence of primary constriction and repulsion at the heterochromatic regions. The heterochromatic regions are the areas near the centromeres and nucleolar organizers. Carrier status cannot be determined by cytogenetic testing. Other common findings of cytogenetic testing on Roberts syndrome patients are listed below.\nAt this point in time, ESCO2 is the only known gene to cause Roberts syndrome mutations. Also, all individuals that have been diagnosed with Roberts syndrome by cytogenetic techniques have also had ESCO2 mutations. Confirmation of a Roberts syndrome diagnosis requires detection of the characteristic chromosomal abnormalities (PCS and HR) or the identification of two ESCO2 mutations that have been linked to Roberts syndrome.[6]\nCarrier testing for Roberts syndrome requires prior identification of the disease-causing mutation in the family. Carriers for the disorder are heterozygotes due to the autosomal recessive nature of the disease. Carriers are also not at risk for contracting Roberts syndrome themselves. A prenatal diagnosis of Roberts syndrome requires an ultrasound examination paired with cytogenetic testing or prior identification of the disease-causing ESCO2 mutations in the family.[6]\nAt this time, there are no other phenotypes (observable expressions of a gene) that have been discovered for mutations in the ESCO2 gene.[6]\nIn cases of mild malformations, the following disorders should be considered in the differential diagnosis:[citation needed]\nIn cases of severe manifestations, the following disorders should be considered in the differential diagnosis:\nIn cases of similar cytogenetic findings, the following disorders should be considered in the differential diagnosis:\nLittle is known about the natural history of Roberts syndrome due to its wide clinical variability. The prognosis of the disease depends on the malformations, as the severity of the malformations correlates with survival. The cause of death for most fatalities of Roberts syndrome have not been reported; however, five deaths were reportedly due to infection.[citation needed]\nThe following are observations that have been made in individuals with cytogenetic findings of PCS/HR or ESCO2 mutations:[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment of Roberts syndrome is individualized and specifically aimed at improving the quality of life for those afflicted with the disorder. Some of the possible treatments include: surgery for the cleft lip and palate, correction of limb abnormalities (also through surgery), and improvement in prehensile hand grasp development.[3]",
    "Epidemiology": "Roberts syndrome is an extremely rare condition that only affects about 150 reported individuals. Although there have been only about 150 reported cases, the affected group is quite diverse and spread worldwide. Parental consanguinity (parents are closely related) is common with this genetic disorder. The frequency of Roberts syndrome carriers is unknown.[3][4]"

    "Disease": "ROHHAD",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The rapid onset obesity aspect of ROHHAD is usually the first diagnostic indicator of the disease. Patients often present with hyperphagia and rapid weight gain. This rapid weight gain is defined as 20-30 pounds over a 6-12 month period, and typically occurs between the ages of 1.5 and 11.[4]\nHypothalamic dysfunction refers to the hypothalamus, which is a structure within the brain which participates in regulating the pituitary gland, autonomic nervous system, and endocrine system.[6] Symptoms related to hypothalamic dysfunction may include abnormal sodium balance (hyponatremia or hypernatremia), high progestin levels, low cortisol levels, delayed or early-onset puberty, and low thyroid hormone.[3] Patients will also often experience a decelerated growth rate throughout childhood.[7]\nSodium imbalance within the body can have severe symptoms and be potentially life-threatening if not controlled. Hyponatremia, or low sodium levels, can cause symptoms such as nausea, headache, seizures, or even cause patients to become comatose.[8] Hypernatremia, or high sodium levels in the blood, can cause nausea, muscle weakness, altered mental status, or coma.[9] Irregular temperature regulation and diabetes insipidus are also possible symptoms of hypothalamic dysfunction.[10]\nROHHAD patients develop these symptoms at varying ages and in varying numbers, but all patients will develop some symptoms of hypothalamic dysfunction.[3]\nSymptoms of hypoventilation and breathing malfunctions typically present after the rapid weight gain. Some patients may initially develop obstructive sleep apnea, which is common in obese children.[3] Obstructive sleep apnea is the most common form of sleep apnea, and causes breathing to abruptly stop and begin again during sleep. This is caused by throat muscles relaxing during sleep and blocking the airway, and is typically noticed as patients will snore loudly throughout the night.[11] Every patient diagnosed with ROHHAD develops alveolar hypoventilation, regardless of whether they presented with sleep apnea.[3] Alveolar hypoventilation is a condition in which patients have very low blood oxygen levels and shallow breathing. In healthy patients, when blood oxygen levels are low, the brain sends a signal to breathe and bring more oxygen to the blood. In ROHHAD patients, this reaction does not occur.[12] This condition is usually only present during sleep. However, in more severely affected patients, shallow breathing may continue throughout the day. Hypoventilation can go unnoticed until cardiopulmonary arrest, which is why ROHHAD has the potential to be a fatal disease.[3] Ventilatory support is required for patients during sleep, but it is only needed during waking hours for those most severely affected (about 50% of patients).[3][10]\nAutonomic dysfunction refers to the autonomic nervous system, which is responsible for regulating internal processes without conscious intervention.[13] This may involve abnormalities in cardiac rhythm, temperature regulation, digestion, and eye movements. Not all ROHHAD patients will experience all of these symptoms, however they will have at least some of these issues.[3] Examples of autonomic dysfunction include hyperthermia, hypothermia, pupillary dysfunction, strabismus, and chronic constipation/diarrhea.[7]\nApproximately 40% of ROHHAD patients will develop tumors originating in the neural crest.[1] These tumors are typically classified as ganglioneuromas or ganglioneuroblastomas.[7] These tumors are not believed to significantly worsen or contribute to the prognosis of ROHHAD.[14] It was suggested that ROHHAD be renamed ROHHADNET in order to include these tumors in the diagnostic criteria, but this has only been adopted for patients who develop these tumors.[3][15]\nSome children diagnosed with ROHHAD may also present with behavioral disorders and/or intellectual disability.[16] However, this is believed to be a result of low oxygen levels secondary to hypoventilation during childhood development. The later ROHHAD is diagnosed, the greater the risk for behavioral problems due to hypoxia from hypoventilation or during cardiopulmonary arrest.[3]",
    "Causes": "The etiology of ROHHAD is currently unknown, and the condition is diagnosed based on a set of clinical criteria.[1] It is believed that there may be a genetic component to ROHHAD, however there is no widely accepted gene linked to the disease.[3] There has been one ROHHAD patient identified to have a mutation in the retinoic acid-induced 1(RAI1) gene through Whole Exome Sequencing, but there has been no otherwise proven link between the RAI1 gene and ROHHAD.[17]\nIt is believed that ROHHAD originates from a combination of genetic and environmental or immunological factors.[1] As of yet, evidence of its etiology has not been discovered and is not well understood.[1]\nIn 2011, a case of monozygotic twins with divergent ROHHAD phenotypes was reported. One twin was affected with ROHHAD and developed symptoms, while the other twin developed normally. This report questioned the theory that ROHHAD is genetically inherited, and the authors suggest that the disease may have an autoimmune or epigenetic etiology.[18]",
    "Diagnosis": "Rapid obesity is the first symptom to arise between the ages of 1.5 and 11. This is typically followed by hypoventilation, which if left untreated, can result in fatal cardiorespiratory arrest.[4] This is why early diagnosis has proven to be imperative for ROHHAD patients, and it has been suggested that ROHHAD be considered in every isolated case of early rapid-onset obesity.[7] Early diagnosis is also vital in preventing and correcting electrolyte and hormone imbalances caused by hypothalamic dysfunction, in order to promote healthy development and prevent further problems.[14]\nAs the symptoms of ROHHAD are so diverse and the condition is so rare, the disease is often misdiagnosed as Cushing's disease or Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome when it first presents in patients.[7]",
    "Treatment": "There is no known cure for ROHHAD, therefore treatment for the disease involves managing symptoms as they manifest in the patient. As not all ROHHAD patients develop the same symptoms, treatment plans vary between patients. Proper treatment of hypothalamic dysfunction and hypoventilation is the most critical aspect of ROHHAD management, as these symptoms have the greatest ability to cause death or behavioral problems if left uncontrolled.[5]\nAttempting to control weight through diet and exercise can be exceedingly difficult in patients with ROHHAD due to a number of factors. Encouraging ROHHAD patients to exercise vigorously can be dangerous, as their breathing will not increase with exertion and this can cause hypoxia. Therefore, it is important for ROHHAD patients to exercise at a moderate intensity and for their oxygen levels to be monitored throughout. Typically, the obesity associated with ROHHAD is managed by preventing further weight gain as the child grows.[3]\nTreatment for hypothalamic dysfunction is tailored to each patient's needs, as there is no set of hypothalamic symptoms that all ROHHAD patients will manifest. All ROHHAD patients should be evaluated by a pediatric endocrinologist in order to determine a treatment plan for hypothalamic dysfunction.[citation needed]\nPatients may be given human growth hormone to treat stunted growth, or hormone replacement to treat any hormone deficiencies. Often patients are placed on a strict fluid regimen to treat for imbalances such as hyponatremia or hypernatremia.[3] Patients who present with diabetes insipidus may also be treated with desmopressin, a synthetic replacement for anti-diuretic hormone.[19]\nEvery ROHHAD patient requires some form of ventilatory support, ranging from non-invasive BiPAP machines to tracheostomy procedures. Approximately 50% of ROHHAD patients will require ventilatory support day and night, whereas the other half only require night-time support.[1]\nA bilevel positive airway pressure machine, or BiPAP, is a ventilator mask worn at night. The BiPAP pushes air into the lungs, therefore breathing for the patient.[20] This is helpful for ROHHAD patients, as hypoventilation causes the mechanism that controls breathing in oxygen to slow and sometimes stop during sleep.[citation needed]\nA tracheostomy is a surgical procedure to create a hole in the trachea in order to give access to the airways for insertion of ventilatory tubing. This procedure is performed to create an airway in situations when long term continuous use of a ventilator is needed.[21] ROHHAD patients whose hypoventilation is so severe that they require support during both day and night will often undergo tracheostomies.[10]\nTreatment for autonomic dysfunction varies greatly, depending on the severity  and type of dysfunction. Many patients with ROHHAD experience strabismus, which is a weakness in the eye muscles causing a \"cross-eyed\" effect. This can be treated with glasses, eye muscle exercises, or even surgery.[22] ROHHAD patients also often experience bradycardia, or low heart rate. This may require the placement of a cardiac pacemaker in order to regulate the heartbeat.[23] Gastrointestinal problems, such as constipation or diarrhea, are often treated on an as-needed basis with laxatives or dietary changes. It is also important that ambient temperatures are monitored in patients who have temperature regulation issues such as hyperthermia or hypothermia.[3]\nTumors of neural crest origin develop in approximately 40% of patients. These are typically ganglioneuromas or ganglioneuroblastomas. Neural crest tumors have the ability to form in multiple organs tissues throughout the body, typically in the chest or abdomen.[24] It is therefore important for ROHHAD patients to have regular MRI and CT scans to screen for tumor growth.[7] It is believed that these tumors do not significantly affect the prognosis for ROHHAD patients.[14] Neuroendocrine tumors can arise 7–16 years after the initial onset of symptoms, therefore the name ROHHADNET (which includes these tumors) has not been widely accepted as it is believed this name would lead to further misdiagnosis. Treatment for these neuroendocrine tumors requires surgical removal, typically performed by a pediatric oncologist.[3]",
    "Prognosis": "The most dangerous and fatal aspect of ROHHAD is the potential for cardiopulmonary arrest if hypoventilation is not found and treated in a timely manner. Approximately 50 to 60% of ROHHAD patients die due to cardiopulmonary arrest.[4] The earlier symptoms are identified and patients are diagnosed, the more positive their outcomes are.[1]\nIt has been found that children who are diagnosed earlier in life and, by extension, receive earlier treatment for hypoventilation and hypothalamic dysfunction (fluid imbalances, etc.) are less likely to develop behavioral issues or experience sudden cardiorespiratory arrest later in life.[5]",
    "Epidemiology": "There have been at least 158 documented cases of ROHHAD worldwide.[27]",
    "Society and culture": "The ROHHAD Association is an organization that aims to increase awareness for ROHHAD and promote research opportunities. They also organized fundraisers and events in order to give to researchers and promote visibility of ROHHAD.[29] ROHHAD Fight Inc is a charity that was created for Marisa, a child who was diagnosed with ROHHAD, with the goal of raising awareness for the condition.[30]"

Among 358 cases of Destombes–Rosai–Dorfman disease that Rosai collected in a disease registry for which the location of lymphadenopathy was specified, 87.3% had cervical lymphadenopathy.[5] Axillary, inguinal, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy are also found in Destombes–Rosai–Dorfman disease.[5]\nAccumulation of histiocytes may occur outside of lymph nodes. The most common sites of extranodal disease in Rosai's registry were skin, nasal cavity/paranasal sinuses, soft tissue, eyelid/orbit, bone, salivary glands, central nervous system, and heart.[6][5]\nThe symptoms of this disease vary with the site of accumulation similar to other regional tumors.  For instance, accumulation in closed spaces such as the cranium can lead to poor outcomes compared to growth in the dermis of an extremity where surgical excision is possible.[citation needed]",
    "Causes": "The etiology of the condition is unknown. Possible but unproven infectious causes are Klebsiella, polyomaviridae, Epstein–Barr virus, parvovirus B19, and human herpesvirus 6.[1][7] Jilin University researchers suggested in 2017 that monocytes recruited to inflammatory lesions could produce macrophage colony-stimulating factor, which leads to a complex signal transduction, which leads to the histiocytosis characteristic of Destombes-Rosai–Dorfman disease.[7]",
    "Diagnosis": "The differential diagnosis of Destombes–Rosai–Dorfman disease includes both malignant and nonmalignant diseases, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, Langerhans cell sarcoma, lymphoma, sarcoidosis, IgG4-related disease, and tuberculosis.[1] The disease is diagnosed by biopsy of affected tissues. Microscopic examination of stained specimens will show histiocytes with lymphocytes and possibly other types of cells trapped within them, a phenomenon known as emperipolesis.[1][7] Upon immunohistochemical staining, the histiocytes will be positive for S100, CD68, and CD163 but negative for CD1a.[1][7]\nIn 2016 the Histiocyte Society proposed a classification of histiocytoses into five groups designated by letters: \"C\", \"H\", \"L\", \"M\", and \"R\".[8] Group \"R\" included Rosai–Dorfman disease and \"miscellaneous noncutaneous, non-Langerhans cell histiocytoses\".[8] Rosai–Dorfman disease itself was classified into \"Familial\", \"Classical (nodal)\", \"Extranodal\", \"Neoplasia-associated\", and \"Immune disease-associated\" subtypes.[8]",

Surgery is used to remove single lymph nodes, central nervous system lesions, or localized cutaneous disease.[1] In 2014, Dalia and colleagues wrote that for patients with extensive or systemic Destombes–Rosai–Dorfman disease, \"a standard of care has not been established\" concerning radiotherapy and chemotherapy.[1]"

Additional symptoms may include fused eyelids, absent nails, delayed bone growth and dry skin. It is believed that this syndrome follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with incomplete penetrance,[5] and caused by a mutation affecting the TP63 gene.[6] It has been suggested that this syndrome, AEC syndrome and Rapp–Hodgkin syndrome may be variations of the same disease.[7]\nIt is not uncommon for heterozygotes for the condition (especially those originating from Margarita Island) to have a broad and flat philtrum.[8]",
    "Causes": "It is caused by mutations in the gene PVRL1 (11q23-q24) which encodes nectin-1, the principal receptor used by alpha-herpesviruses to mediate entry into human cells. Although the mechanism underlying the physiopathology of this syndrome is still unknown, it has been proposed that nectin-1 is a cell-cell adhesion molecule that is preferentially expressed in keratinocytes and that mutations in PVRL1 may abrogate NAP (nectin, afadin, ponsin)-dependent cell-cell adhesion. It is thought that the genetic transmission is autosomal recessive gene transmission.[8]\nThe cause was found in the year 2000 by Suzuki et al. when he analyzed the genome of patients with the disorder and discovered a homozygous nonsense mutation in the PVRL1 gene, in chromosome 11. It was suggested that the regular occurrence of this disorder among the people of Margarita Island was due to resistance to alpha-herpes viruses people carrying only one copy of the mutated gene (heterozygosity) had. The same mutation in the same gene was found in two families from the Middle East and South America (Israel and Brazil respectively.) by the same researchers (Suzuki et al.)",

    "Disease": "Saethre%E2%80%93Chotzen syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "SCS presents in a variable fashion. The majority of individuals with SCS are moderately affected, with uneven facial features and a relatively flat face due to underdeveloped eye sockets, cheekbones, and lower jaw. In addition to the physical abnormalities, people with SCS also experience growth delays, which results in a relatively short stature. Although, most individuals with SCS are of normal intelligence, some individuals may have mild to moderate mental delays. More severe cases of SCS, with more serious facial deformities, occurs when multiple cranial sutures close prematurely.[2]",
    "Causes": "The cranium consists of three main sections including the base of the cranium (occipital bone), the face (frontal bone), and the top (parietal bones) and sides (temporal bone) of the head. Most of the bones of the cranium are permanently set into place prior to birth. However, the temporal and parietal bones are separated by sutures, which remain open, allowing the head to slightly change in shape during childbirth. The cranial sutures eventually close within the first couple of years following birth, after the brain has finished growing.[2]\nIn individuals with SCS, the coronal suture separating the frontal bones from the parietal bones, closes prematurely (craniosynostosis), occasionally even before birth. If the coronal suture closes asymmetrically or unilaterally, then the face and forehead will form unevenly, from side-to-side. People with SCS have pointy, tower-like heads because their brain is growing faster than their skull, resulting in increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and causing the top of the head and/or forehead to bulge out to allow for brain growth. The face appears uneven, particularly in the areas of the eyes and cheeks, and the forehead appears wide and tall.[2]\nBecause of the abnormal forehead, there is less space for the normal facial features to develop. This results in shallow eye sockets and flat cheekbones. The shallow eye sockets make the eyes more prominent or bulging and cause the eyes to be more separated than normal (hypertelorism). The underdeveloped eye sockets, cheekbones, and lower jaw cause the face to appear flat. Furthermore, the minor downward slant of the eyes along with the drooping eyelids (ptosis) adds to the overall unevenness of the face.[2]",
    "Diagnosis": "Prenatal diagnosis of Saethre-Chotzen Syndrome in high risk pregnancies is doable, but very uncommon and rarely performed. Furthermore, this is only possible if the mutation causing the disease has already been identified within the family genome. There are a few different techniques in which prenatal testing can be carried out.  Prenatal testing is usually performed around 15–18 weeks, using amniocentesis to extract DNA from the fetus's cells. Prenatal testing can also be performed during weeks 10–12 using chorionic villus sampling (CVS) to extract DNA from the fetus.[7] Recently, there has been an increased interest in utilizing ultrasound equipment in order to detect fetal skull abnormalities due to immature fusion of the cranial sutures.[4]\nThe overall diagnosis of SCS is primarily based on clinical findings and observations based on dysmorphology examination (assessing structural defects) and radiographic evaluation (X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans).[6]\nA clinical diagnosis of SCS can be verified by testing the TWIST1 gene (only gene in which mutations are known to cause SCS) for mutations using DNA analysis, such as sequence analysis, deletion/duplication analysis, and cytogenetics/ FISH analysis. Sequence analysis of exon 1 (TWIST1 coding region) provides a good method for detecting the frequency of mutations in the TWIST1 gene. These mutations include nonsense, missense, splice site mutation, and intragenic deletions/insertions. Deletion/duplication analysis identifies mutations in the TWIST1 gene that are not readily detected by sequence analysis. Common methods include PCR, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), and chromosomal microarray (CMA). Cytogenetic/FISH analysis attaches fluorescently labels DNA markers to a denatured chromosome and is then examined under fluorescent lighting, which reveals mutations caused by translocations or inversions involving 7p21. Occasionally, individuals with SCS have a chromosome translocation, inversion, or ring chromosome 7 involving 7p21 resulting in atypical findings, such as, increased developmental delay.[7] Individuals with SCS, typically have normal brain functioning and rarely have mental impairments. For this reason, if an individual has both SCS and mental retardation, then they should have their TWIST1 gene screened more carefully because this is not a normal trait of SCS.[2] Cytogenetic testing and direct gene testing can also be used to study gene/chromosome defects. Cytogenetic testing is the study of chromosomes to detect gains or losses of chromosomes or chromosome segments using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and/or comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Direct gene testing uses blood, hair, skin, amniotic fluid, or other tissues in order to find genetic disorders. Direct gene testing can determine whether an individual has SCS by testing the individual's blood for mutations in the TWIST1 gene.[7]\nGenetic testing allows for a definitive diagnosis because it allows similar conditions to be differentiated from each other based on which gene is mutated.[2] The following table contains conditions similar to SCS:",
    "Treatment": "The physical abnormalities resulting from SCS are typically mild and only require a minor surgical procedure or no procedure at all. One of the common symptoms of SCS is the development of short (brachydactyly), webbed fingers and broad toes (syndactyly). These characteristics do not cause any problems to the function of the hands or feet, and thus, no medical procedure is required to fix the abnormalities, unless the patient requests it. Webbing of the fingers may affect the base of the fingers, resulting in delayed hand growth during childhood, but this contributes no functional impairments. Sometimes, individuals with SCS develop broad toes because the bones at the ends of the toes are duplicating themselves. This is especially seen in the big toe, but requires no surgical intervention because it doesn't negatively affect the overall function of the foot. Individuals with these toe abnormalities walk normally and can wear normal footwear.[9]\nIn more severe cases, frequent surgeries and clinical monitoring are required throughout development. A child born with asymmetrical unilateral coronal synostosis should undergo cranioplasty within its first year of life in order to prevent increased intracranial pressure and to prevent progressive facial asymmetry. Cranioplasty is a surgical procedure to correct prematurely fused cranial bones. The surgery acts to reconstruct and reposition the bones and sutures in order to promote the most normal growth.[6] Cranioplasty is necessary in order to continue to grow and is important for two main reasons. First of all, the skull needs to be able to accommodate the growing brain following childbirth, which it can't because the skull doesn't grow as fast as the brain as long as the sutures remain fused. This results in an increase in pressure surrounding the brain and inhibits the brain from growing, causing the individual to experience significant problems, and if left untreated can eventually lead to death. Secondly, cranioplasty may be required for appearance purposes.[7] This is especially the case in individuals with asymmetrical unilateral coronal synostosis, which requires reconstructive surgery of the face and skull. If cranioplasty is not performed, especially in individuals with unilateral coronal synostosis, then facial asymmetry will get worse and worse over time, which is why cranioplasty should be performed as soon as possible.[9]\nSurgery may also be required in individuals with vision problems. Vision problems usually arise due to a lack of space in the eye orbit and skull because of the abnormal bone structure of the face. Decreased space may also lead to abnormal or missing tear ducts and nerve damage. Reconstructive surgery is usually required in order to increase cranial space, correct tear duct stenosis, and/or correct ptosis of the eyelids in order to prevent amblyopia (lazy eye).[2]\nMidfacial surgery may also be required during early childhood to correct respiratory problems, dental malocclusion, and swallowing difficulties. A cleft palate is also corrected with surgery, and may involve the use of tympanostomy tubes. If needed, an individual will undergo orthognathic treatment and/or orthodontic treatment after facial development is complete.[2] Since hearing loss is frequently associated with SCS, it is recommended that audiology screening persist throughout childhood.[6]\nAfter cranial reconstructive surgery, a child may be required to wear a molding helmet or some other form of head protection until the cranial bones set into place. This typically takes about three months and depends on the child's age and the severity of the condition. Following recovery, individuals with SCS look and act completely normal, so no one would even be able to tell that they have SCS.[10]",
    "Epidemiology": "SCS is the most common craniosynostosis syndrome and affects 1 in every 25,000 to 50,000 individuals.[11] It occurs in all racial and ethnic groups, and affects males and females equally.[2] If a parent carries a copy of the SCS gene mutation, then there is a 50% chance their child will also carry a copy of the gene mutation, in which case, the child may or may not show signs of SCS. There is also a 50% chance their child will have two working copies of the gene, and would therefore, not have SCS. If both parents carry a single copy of the SCS gene mutation, then there is a 25% chance their child will have two gene mutation copies (so child would develop severe SCS), a 25% chance their child would have two normal copies of the gene (so would be completely normal), and a 50% chance their child would carry one gene mutation copy and 1 normal copy (so child may or may not display SCS).[2] In rare situations, two normal parents can have a child with SCS due to a de novo mutation. The exact cause of the de novo mutation is unknown, but it doesn't seem to be related to anything that the parents did or didn't do during the pregnancy.[12] SCS due to a de novo mutation is so rare that the proportion of past cases is unknown.[7]"

    "Disease": "Salla disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Affected infants appear normal at birth but may develop symptoms during the first year of life. Individuals with Salla disease may present with nystagmus as well as hypotonia, and may have difficulty coordinating voluntary movements (ataxia), reduced muscle tone and strength, and cognitive impairment.[5] The most severely impaired children do not walk or acquire language, but the typical patient learns to walk and speak and has normal life expectancy. The MRI shows arrested or delayed myelination.[6]\nApproximately two-thirds of children with mild FSASD eventually learn to walk. Some degree of speech impairment is usually present. Affected infants may learn single words or small sentences, but this ability may be lost as they age. The ability to produce speech is affected more severely than the ability to understand speech. Affected children exhibit some degree of cognitive impairment as well.[citation needed]\nFSASD (Salla and Infantile Free Sialic Acid Storage Disease) affects males and females in equal numbers. The worldwide prevalence of FSASD is estimated at less than 1 per 1,000,000 individuals. Higher estimated prevalence rates occur in the Salla region of Finland and other Scandinavian countries.[citation needed]\nApproximately ~300 individuals with FSASD have been reported in the literature, of which the majority (> 160 cases) are of Finnish or Swedish ancestry. Individuals with FSASD may be misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency of the disease in the general population.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "A diagnosis of this disorder can be made by measuring urine to look for elevated levels of free sialic acid.[8] Prenatal testing is also available for known carriers of this disorder.[citation needed] The diagnosis is ultimately confirmed by identifying genetic mutation(s) in the SLC17A5 gene by molecular genetic testing. This testing is available on a clinical basis.",
    "Treatment": "There is no cure for Salla disease. Treatment is limited to controlling the symptoms of this disorder. Anti-convulsant medication may control seizure episodes. Physical therapists can assist an affected individual in building muscle strength and coordination.[citation needed]\nGenetic counseling is recommended for affected individuals and their families.[citation needed]\nAll studies receiving U.S. Government funding, and some supported by private industry, are posted on this government website.[9]",
    "Prognosis": "Some individuals with mild FSASD may not develop symptoms until later in childhood when a variety of neurological findings become apparent. These include seizures, involuntary muscle spasms that result in slow, stiff movements of the legs (spasticity), and repetitive, involuntary, writhing movements of the arms and legs (athetosis). Some individuals who previously developed the ability to walk or talk may lose these skills (regression). Some individuals may experience a gradual coarsening of facial features.[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "Sandhoff disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Sandhoff disease symptoms are clinically indeterminable from Tay–Sachs disease. The classic infantile form of the disease has the most severe symptoms and is incredibly hard to diagnose at this early age.[6]  The first signs of symptoms begin before 6 months of age and the parents' notice when the child begins regressing in their development.  If the children had the ability to sit up by themselves or crawl they will lose this ability.  This is caused by a slow deterioration of the muscles in the child's body from the buildup of GM2 gangliosides.  Since the body is unable to create the enzymes it needs within the central nervous system, it is unable to attach to these gangliosides to break them apart and make them non-toxic.  With this buildup there are several symptoms that begin to appear such as muscle/motor weakness, sharp reaction to loud noises, blindness, deafness, inability to react to stimulants, respiratory problems and infections, mental retardation, seizures, cherry red spots in the retina, enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), pneumonia, or bronchopneumonia.[7]\nThe other two forms of Sandhoff disease have similar symptoms but to a lesser extent.  Adult and juvenile forms of Sandhoff disease are more rare than the infantile form.[8] In these cases victims suffer cognitive impairment (retardation) and a loss of muscle coordination that impairs and eventually destroys their ability to walk; the characteristic red spots in the retina also develop. The adult form of the disease, however, is sometimes milder, and may only lead to muscle weakness that impairs walking or the ability to get out of bed.[9]",
    "Causes": "Two parents carrying a mutated gene and passing it on to their offspring cause the disease.  Even with both parents carrying the disease in their genome, there is only a 25% chance that they will have a child containing the genetic coding for the disease (see figure right).[10]\nEach form of the disease is caused by the differences in the various mutations of the genome, in particular the codons on the 14 exons in the HEX B gene located within chromosome 5 (see figure bottom), leading to the differences in severities of the symptoms.[6]  The difference in the codons has the consequence of inhibiting two enzymes located in the lysosomes of the neurons of the central nervous system. Lysosomes contain various enzymes to break down byproducts and toxins to ensure they do not accumulate enough to interfere with the function of the central nervous system.[7]\nUsing restriction enzymes, it was discovered that a mutation on chromosome 5 particularly within the C1214T allele caused the adult onset form of Sandhoff Disease. For the patient showing symptoms of the infantile or juvenile form they have a mutation on exon I207V from their father, and a 16 base pair deletion from their mother which can be located on as many as five exons, exons 1–5.[11]\nArticles regarding Sandhoff disease frequencies among distinct groups of people contain discrepancies from one another. More than 25 mutations have been reported other than novel mutations.[5]\nOne article says that Sandhoff disease is found commonly in individuals with a non-Jewish descent.[12]\nOthers say that it is more commonly in:\nDiscovery of several mutations in Ashkenazi Jews may reflect ascertainment bias rather than a high population frequency, because Ashkenazi Jews were the targeted population in a mass screening program for Tay-Sachs disease. Several rare SD mutations were discovered as researchers resolved cases of enzyme deficiency among suspected TSD carriers, but no cases of the disease itself have been reported.[5][15]\nHowever, since it is an autosomal recessive disease, it is likely found in any ethnic group passing from generation to generation through carriers without being expressed in their offspring. Even though the family may not have a history of Sandhoff disease, it is possible for two individuals to have a child with the disease. Since Sandhoff disease was only discovered in 1968, there are years the disease has gone undetected because of misdiagnoses.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "Sandhoff disease can be detected through the following procedures (before it is apparent through physical examination): a biopsy removing a sample of tissue from the liver, genetic testing, molecular analysis of cells and tissues (to determine the presence of a genetic metabolic disorder), enzyme assay, and occasionally a urinalysis to determine if the above-noted compounds are abnormally stored within the body. For a child to suffer from this disease, both parents must be carriers, and both must transmit the mutation to the child. Thus, even in the case where both parents have the mutation, there is only a 25 percent chance their child will inherit the condition. Frequently, parents are given the opportunity to have a DNA screening if they are at high risk, to determine their carrier status before they have children. However, it is also highly recommended to undergo testing even for those parents who do not have a family history of Sandhoff disease. Over 95% of the families that have children with Sandhoff disease had no known prior family history of the condition, as the mutation in the HEXB gene does not cause clinical symptoms when only one copy is present, and often passed undetected from one generation to the next[6] Naturally, if an individual carries the mutation, he or she has a risk of transmitting it to the unborn child. Genetic counseling is recommended for those who have the mutation.[citation needed]\nIt is possible for parents who are about to have a child or had a child with Sandhoff Disease can have a PGD or PEGD.  PEGD is pre-embryonic genetic diagnosis for the parents that would not benefit from a pre-implantation genetic diagnosis because of their religion or negative attitude for the discarding of embryos.  PEGD sequences the genome of the embryo to be produced by two parents if they were to conceive a child.  If the family has a history of Sandhoff disease it is recommended they have their genome sequenced to ensure they are not carriers or to sequence the genome of their child.[17]\nThere are three types of Sandhoff disease: classic infantile, juvenile, and adult late onset.[16] Each form is classified by the severity of the symptoms as well as the age at which the patient shows these symptoms.[18]\nJuvenile and adult onset forms of Sandhoff disease are very rare. Signs and symptoms can begin in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood and are usually milder than those seen with the infantile form of Sandhoff disease. As in the infantile form, mental abilities and coordination are affected. Characteristic features include muscle weakness, loss of muscle coordination (ataxia) and other problems with movement, speech problems, and mental illness. These signs and symptoms vary widely among people with late-onset forms of Sandhoff disease.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Currently Sandhoff disease does not have any standard treatment and does not have a cure. However, a person suffering from the disease needs proper nutrition, hydration, and maintenance of clear airways. To reduce some symptoms that may occur with Sandhoff disease, the patient may take anticonvulsants to manage seizures or medications to treat respiratory infections, and consume a precise diet consisting of puree foods due to difficulties swallowing. Infants with the disease usually die by the age of 3 due to respiratory infections. The patient must be under constant surveillance because they can suffer from aspiration or lack the ability to change from the passageway to their lungs versus their stomach and their spit travels to the lungs causing bronchopneumonia.  The patient also lacks the ability to cough and therefore must undergo a treatment to shake up their body to remove the mucus from the lining of their lungs.  Medication is also given to patients to lessen their symptoms including seizures.[citation needed]\nCurrently the government is testing several treatments including N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin in mice, as well as stem cell treatment in humans and other medical treatments recruiting test patients.[11] A Sandhoff disease study showing proof of principle for gene therapy in a human model system using CRISPR and virus gene correction gives the chance for clinical trials to cure the disease. The ultra-rare occurrence is a main hurdle to overcome for clinical trials.[22][23]"

    "Disease": "Sanfilippo syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The age of onset, severity, and progression of the disease can vary greatly between patients with different subtypes and within the same subtype. Development during the prenatal and early post-natal stages progresses normally.[4] Between the ages of one and four is when the disease typically manifests.[5] Affected infants appear normal, although some mild facial dysmorphism may be noticeable. Of all of the MPS diseases, Sanfilippo syndrome produces the fewest physical abnormalities. Possible clinical somatic symptoms, although rare, include coarse facial features with broad eyebrows, dark eyelashes, dry and rough hair, and skeletal pathology that affects growth.[6]\nAfter an initial symptom-free interval, symptoms may arise during the early years of development, from the age of one to three.[6] Children usually present with delayed cognitive development and behavioral problems, followed by progressive intellectual decline resulting in severe dementia and progressive motor disease.[7] Acquisition of speech is often slow and incomplete. Although delayed cognitive development may occur, it tends to be mild in individuals with Sanfilippo syndrome.[8]\nBetween the ages of three and ten, the disease progresses to increasing behavioral disturbance including temper tantrums, hyperactivity, destructive behavior, aggressive behavior, pica, difficulties with toilet training, and sleep disturbance.[2] As affected children initially have normal muscle strength and mobility, the behavioral disturbances may be difficult to manage. The disordered sleep in particular presents a significant problem to care providers.[9] People with this disorder may stay in this phase for five to ten years.[6] After that, the behavioral disturbances subside. However, patients start to become increasingly immobile and unresponsive, as individuals with Sanfilippo syndrome will gradually lose their motor skills, often require wheelchairs, and develop swallowing difficulties and seizures.[10] Persons with Sanfilippo syndrome tend to regress to an unresponsive or vegetative state until they pass away.[6] The life-span of a severely affected person does not usually extend beyond late teens to early twenties.[11] However, patients with less severe phenotypes of the disease have varied life spans, with some cases even surviving into their seventies.[9]\nThe most common symptoms seen in individuals with Sanfilippo syndrome are neurological and may include intellectual disabilities, impaired language development, abnormal movements, and trouble sleeping; however, other symptoms commonly seen are excessive hair growth, chronic ear infections, respiratory infections, and poor nutrient absorption.[12] Other signs less frequently seen in persons with Sanfilippo syndrome include behavioral changes and musculoskeletal changes such as increased muscle and joint stiffness and changes in bone growth or density.[12][2]\nChildren with Sanfilippo syndrome often have an increased tolerance to pain. Bumps, bruises, or ear infections that would be painful for other children often go unnoticed in children with Sanfilippo syndrome. Some children with Sanfilippo syndrome may have a blood-clotting problem during and after surgery.[5]\nIndividuals with Sanfilippo syndrome are born within normal physiological ranges. At around age 2, individuals with Sanfilippo syndrome are significantly taller than children without the condition.[13] By the age of 4, mostly male children with Sanfilippo syndrome were still taller than unaffected children.[13] Growth velocity decelerates dramatically after the age of 5, and by the time children with Sanfilippo syndrome reach 17, all individuals are significantly shorter than their reference groups.[13]\nIt is difficult to clinically distinguish symptomatic differences among the four types of Sanfilippo syndrome, although each of the types can vary in severity.[14] Type A is usually the most severe subtype, characterized by the earliest onset, rapid clinical progression with severe symptoms, and short survival, with patients' life expectancy averaging between 15 and 18 years old.[14] Type B is considered slightly less aggressive than type A, but still displays rapid clinical progression and short survival, with patients' life expectancy averaging between 17 and 19 years old.[14] Type C is considered the least aggressive form of Sanfilippo syndrome, with patients' average life expectancy between 19 and 34 years of age, depending on the study.[14] Type D is a rare subtype of Sanfilippo syndrome, and no data has been published on average life expectancy.[14]",
    "Diagnosis": "Sanfilippo syndrome types A, B, C, and D are considered to be clinically indistinguishable, although mutations in different genes are responsible for each disease. Another subtype has been identified, but it has only been found in mice.[14] The following discussion is therefore applicable to all four conditions. Thus, there are two main ways that can be used to confirm if an individual has Sanfilippo syndrome: a urinalysis and genetic testing.[23][2]\nA urinalysis can show elevated levels of heparan sulfate in the urine.[15] All four types of Sanfilippo syndrome show increased levels of GAGs in the urine, so there is no distinction between the Sanfilippo syndrome subtypes based on a urinalysis alone; however, in MPS IIIA and IIIB patients, the plasma and CSF were also found to be elevated.[24] Additionally, urinary GAG levels are higher in infants and toddlers than in older children. In order to avoid a false negative urine test due to dilution, it is important that a urine sample be taken first thing in the morning. The diagnosis may be confirmed by enzyme assay of skin fibroblasts and white blood cells, as well as gene sequencing. Through gene sequencing, known genetic defects can be detected in order to identify the disease.[23] Aside from confirming diagnosis, genetic testing is also recommended to determine carriers and to understand development of the disease.[9]\nThere are various stages in a child's life in which they can be diagnosed with Sanfilippo syndrome. Diagnosing a child prior to presentation of symptoms is integral for experimental treatments to be beneficial.[25] Prenatal diagnosis is possible by chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis.[26] Newborn diagnosis is also a possibility; however, no country has mandated testing for this specific disease. Testing for newborns includes examining their blood to locate the mutation.[25] Although there is no current standard, largely due to economical reasons, a whole genome sequencing may prove to be beneficial in the future. This method can shorten the route for accurate diagnosis, which can ultimate help the individual and their families.[23]\nA diagnosis of Sanfilippo syndrome should be considered by providers if a child presents with symptoms associated with other disorders such as behavioral or attention deficit disorders or autism spectrum disorder[10] as there is overlap of behaviors with these conditions.[27] Diagnosing individuals with Sanfilippo syndrome can be challenging because of the rarity of the disease and variability of the presentation in early symptoms and an accurate diagnosis may take years. Due to the neurological symptoms presented in Sanfilippo syndrome, misdiagnoses can occur, such as developmental delays, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnoses being made.[28] Moreover, other medical conditions that present with physical symptoms such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis or behavioral issues such as Landau–Kleffner syndrome can be mistaken for the disease and prevent early diagnosis of Sanfilippo. Additionally, screening for Sanfilippo syndrome is not a routine procedure, which can also delay a proper diagnosis to have the best possible management.[23]\nOnce a diagnosis has been made, it is important that children are monitored and seen regularly by their healthcare provider to assess the progression of disease, decline of normal function, and to identify other health issues associated with Sanfilippo syndrome such as cardiac, musculoskeletal, and gastrointestinal problems.[9] Testing to monitor disease progression includes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), x-rays, electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and abdominal imaging. These tests are more specifically used to determine the source of neurological pain, cognitive and behavioral changes, physical symptoms of pain, cardiac abnormalities, and symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Examples of routine monitoring includes physical, eye, ear, nutritional, and dental exams.[9]",
    "Treatment": "While treatment remains largely supportive, research advancements are being made in the fields of pharmacology, stem cell, and genetics to address the disease. Currently, there is no cure for any subtype of Sanfilippo syndrome.[17][29]\nSupportive therapies to manage Sanfilippo syndrome include the use of medications, physical therapy, medical equipment, surgery, and occupational therapy to treat behavioral and cognitive delays, musculoskeletal damage, and to improve overall quality of life.[2] Evidence for medications that effectively manage behavioral problems and seizures in children with Sanfilippo syndrome are limited.[2][9] Occupational and physical therapy can assist children with any movement restrictions. Staying up to date with vaccines against pneumococcal disease is also recommended due to the increased risk of contracting respiratory infections. Surgical interventions can be used to minimize ear infections, scoliosis, and other complications that occur during the disease progression. Due to the disease's impact on different organs and systems, healthcare professionals from various fields are involved and integral in managing the child's symptoms.[9]\nPharmacological interventions for the management of symptoms associated with Sanfilippo syndrome vary depending on the affected organ system. These may include gastrointestinal medications, antibiotics, anticholinergics, melatonin for sleep disorders, or neurological medications to help modify behaviors or control seizures.[9] It is important to note that behavioral disturbances of Sanfilippo syndrome may vary in response to medication, as each individual may react differently to the medications that are intended to treat the individual's mental state.[23] However, medication usage can still be pursued to treat an individual's symptoms instead of managing Sanfilippo syndrome to improve their quality of life.[citation needed]\nIf an early diagnosis is made, bone marrow replacement may be beneficial.[30] Patients that underwent bone marrow transplant before the age of two showed neurocognitive function stabilization.[31] Although the missing enzyme can be manufactured and given intravenously (also known as enzyme replacement therapy) to help treat other non-neurological lysosomal storage diseases and Sanfilippo syndrome with minor neurological impacts, it cannot penetrate the blood–brain barrier and therefore cannot treat the moderate to severe neurological manifestations of MPS-III.[16] Along with many other lysosomal storage diseases, MPS-III exists as a model of a monogenetic disease involving the central nervous system.[23]\nGene therapy in particular is under Phase I/II clinical trial in France since October 2011 under the leadership of Paris-based biotechnology company Lysogene.[32][33] Other potential therapies include chemical modification of deficient enzymes to allow them to penetrate the blood–brain barrier, stabilization of abnormal but active enzyme to prevent its degradation, and implantation of stem cells strongly expressing the missing enzyme. For any future treatment to be successful, it must be administered as early as possible. Currently, MPS-III is mainly diagnosed clinically, by which stage it is probably too late for any treatment to be very effective. Neonatal screening programs would provide the earliest possible diagnosis.[citation needed]\nAnother treatment currently being studied is enzyme replacement therapy, which works by replacing the enzyme that is not present or deficient by infusing the enzyme into the body.[34] However, a challenge of this treatment option is that the enzymes being replaced do not have the ability to cross the blood–brain barrier, one of the places sulfate heparan accumulates.[6] Additionally, antibodies that can break down the added enzyme are present in individuals with Sanfilippo syndrome, which can reduce the efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy.[16] In studies, injection of the enzyme sulfamidase into the brain or cerebrospinal fluid of mice has been shown to reduce symptoms of Sanfilippo syndrome. Interestingly, injecting sulfamidase in places outside the CNS has not shown to be as effective.[citation needed]\nSubstrate reduction therapy (SRT) is also currently being studied to treat Sanfilippo syndrome. Since Sanfilippo syndrome occurs due to the body's inability to break down GAGs, SRT functions by targeting the genes responsible for the synthesis of GAGs to restore the balance of production and breakdown of GAGs.[16] While this therapy is innovative, the technology to deliver the therapy to ensure effectiveness is not yet available. A part of SRT, genistein is also believed to play a role in reducing GAG synthesis in cells by blocking hormones that are responsible for enhancing GAG production.[35][16] The safety of oral genistein has been confirmed in clinical trials with children;[35] however, results on its effectiveness are inconclusive. One clinical trial showed reduction of heparan sulfate but no clinical benefit, while another trial showed behavioral improvement due to reduction in heparan sulfate and neuroinflammation.[citation needed] There is currently one clinical trial ongoing on genistein therapy.[36]\nSeveral support and research groups have been established to speed the development of new treatments for Sanfilippo syndrome.[37][38][39][40][41]",
    "Prognosis": "According to a study of people with Sanfilippo syndrome, the median life expectancy varies depending on the subtype. In Sanfilippo syndrome type A, the mean age at death (± standard deviation) was 15.22 ± 4.22 years; for type B, it was 18.91 ± 7.33 years; and, for type C, it was 23.43 ± 9.47 years. The mean life expectancy for type A has increased since the 1970s.[42] In severe cases of Sanfilippo syndrome, less than twenty percent of people survive past 20 years of age.[10]",
    "Epidemiology": "It is estimated that approximately 1 in 70,000 newborns are born with Sanfilippo syndrome.[43] The point prevalence (the proportion of people in a population that has the trait at a given point of time) can vary from 1 to 9 in 1,000,000 people.[43] Sanfilippo syndrome varies geographically, with approximately 1 case per 280,000 live births in Northern Ireland,[44] 1 per 66,000 in Australia,[45] and 1 per 50,000 in the Netherlands.[46] Globally, there are an estimated 12,000 to 19,000 individuals living with types A, B, and C.[47] Subtypes A and B are predominately found in Europe, with subtype A specific to the northern region and subtype B specific to the southern region.[14]\nStudies were performed across several countries assessing the mean age of diagnosis for each type of Sanfilippo syndrome.[43] For patients with Sanfilippo syndrome type A, mean age at diagnosis was found to between 3.5 and 4.9 years of age. For patients with Sanfilippo syndrome type B, mean age at diagnosis was found to be between 3.5 and 4.9 years of age. For patients with Sanfilippo syndrome type C, mean age at diagnosis was found to be between 4.5 and 19 years of age. For patients with Sanfilippo syndrome type D, mean age at diagnosis was found to be between 8.2 and 8.3 years of age.[43]\nWorldwide, Sanfilippo syndrome type A and B affects the most people with types C and D seen less commonly; however, the actual number of persons affected may be more than reported due to incorrect or delayed diagnosis of the disorder.[10] An Australian study estimated the following incidences for each subtype of Sanfilippo syndrome in the Australian population:\nOver 50% of individual with Sanfilippo syndrome type A's die from pneumonia.[42] The remaining causes of death for type A are spread out between cardiorespiratory failure, gastrointestinal complications, central nervous system complications, and other.[42] Pneumonia is also the primary cause of death for Sanfilippo syndrome type B.[42] Over 30% of individuals with Sanfilippo syndrome type B die from pneumonia. The remaining causes of death for type B are spread out between cardiorespiratory failure, gastrointestinal complications and other.[42] Due to the rarity of Sanfilippo syndrome type C and D, not enough data was collected to estimate mortality rates.[42]",
    "Society and culture": "The economic burden of Sanfilippo syndrome worldwide has not been studied; however, new research shows the disease's impact in monetary and disability-adjusted life year (DALYs) terms in the United States. DALYs stands for \"disability-adjusted life years\" and the article describes it as \"...years of life lost from early death and the years lived with a disability or ill-health, compared to a typical healthy life.\"[49] The disease is estimated to cost the U.S. $1.55 billion in the next twenty years, and due to the heavy burden caregivers of children with Sanfilippo syndrome carry, they were estimated to lose an average of 2.08 DALYs (father) or 4.08 DALYs (mother), with an economical loss of $4.54 million and $5.61 million DALYs. A child diagnosed with the disease loses 53 (male) or 58 DALYs (female).[49]"

    "Disease": "Scarlet fever",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Scarlet fever typically presents with a sudden onset of sore throat, fever, and malaise. Headache, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain may also be present.[11] Scarlet fever usually follows from a group A streptococcal infection that involves a strep throat, such as streptococcal tonsillitis or more usually streptococcal pharyngitis. Often these can present together, known as pharyngotonsillitis. The signs and symptoms are therefore those of a strep throat but these are followed by the inclusion of the characteristic widespread rash.[12] The rash usually appears one to two days later, but may appear before or up to seven days following feeling ill.[1]\nIt generally hurts to swallow.[1] However, not all cases present with a fever, the degree of tiredness may vary, the sore throat and tongue changes might be slight or absent, and in some the rash can be patchy rather than diffuse.[5][page needed] Cough, hoarseness, runny nose, diarrhea, and conjunctivitis are typically absent in scarlet fever; such symptoms indicate what is more likely a viral infection.[13]\nStrep throat is usually associated with fatigue and a fever of over 39 °C (102.2 °F).[13] The tonsils may appear red and enlarged and are typically covered in exudate.[12] The throat may be red with small red spots on the roof of the mouth.[4] The uvula can look red and swollen.[5] 30% to 60% of cases have associated enlarged and tender lymph nodes in the neck.[5] During the first two days of illness the tongue may have a whitish coating from which red swollen papillae protrude, giving the appearance of a \"white strawberry tongue\".[5] After four to five days when the white coating sheds it becomes a \"red strawberry tongue\".[5] The symptomatic appearance of the tongue is part of the rash that is characteristic of scarlet fever.[14][15][16]\nThe characteristic rash has been denoted as \"scarlatiniform\", and it appears as a diffuse redness of the skin with small bumps resembling goose bumps.[17] It typically appears as small flat spots on the neck or torso before developing into small bumps that spread to the arms and legs.[18] It tends to feel rough like sandpaper.[19] The cheeks might look flushed with a pale area around the mouth.[1] The scarlet fever rash generally looks red on white and pale skin, and might be difficult to visualise on brown or black skin, in whom the bumps are typically larger, the skin looks like sandpaper, and the perioral pallor less obvious.[5] The palms and soles are spared.[18] The reddened skin blanches when pressure is applied to it.[5] The skin may feel itchy, but is not painful.[5] A more intense redness on the inside of skin folds and creases might be noticed.[4] These are lines of petechiae, appearing as pink/red areas located in arm pits and elbow pits.[18] It takes around a week for the main rash to disappear.[1] This may be followed by several weeks of peeling of the skin of typically fingers and toes.[1] The desquamation process usually begins on the face and progresses downward on the body.[5] Sometimes, this peeling is the only sign that scarlet fever occurred.[12] If the case of scarlet fever is uncomplicated, recovery from the fever and clinical symptoms, other than the process of desquamation, occurs in 5–10 days.[20] After the desquamation, the skin will be left with a sunburned appearance.[21]\nChildren younger than five years old may have atypical presentations and many of the common signs and symptoms may be missing or different. Children younger than 3 years old can present with nasal congestion and a lower grade fever.[22] Infants may present with symptoms of increased irritability and decreased appetite.[22]\nThe complications, which can arise from scarlet fever when left untreated or inadequately treated, can be divided into two categories: suppurative and nonsuppurative.[4]\nSuppurative complications: These are rare complications that arise either from direct spread to structures that are close to the primary site of infection, or spread through the lymphatic system or blood. In the first case, scarlet fever may spread to the pharynx. Possible problems from this method of spread include peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscesses, cellulitis, mastoiditis, or sinusitis.[citation needed]\nIn the second case, the streptococcal infection may spread through the lymphatic system or the blood to areas of the body further away from the pharynx. A few examples of the many complications that can arise from those methods of spread include endocarditis, pneumonia, or meningitis.[23]\nNonsuppurative complications: These complications arise from certain subtypes of group A streptococci that cause an autoimmune response in the body through what has been termed molecular mimicry. In these cases, the antibodies which the person's immune system developed to attack the group A streptococci are also able to attack the person's own tissues. The following complications result, depending on which tissues in the person's body are targeted by those antibodies.[17]",
    "Causes": "Strep throat spreads by close contact among people, via respiratory droplets (for example, saliva or nasal discharge).[21] A person in close contact with another person infected with group A streptococcal pharyngitis has a 35% chance of becoming infected.[22] One in ten children who are infected with group A streptococcal pharyngitis will develop scarlet fever.[16]",
    "Diagnosis": "Although the presentation of scarlet fever can be clinically diagnosed, further testing may be required to distinguish it from other illnesses.[5] Also, history of a recent exposure to someone with strep throat can be useful in diagnosis.[21] There are two methods used to confirm suspicion of scarlet fever; rapid antigen detection test and throat culture.[22]\nThe rapid antigen detection test is a very specific test but not very sensitive. This means that if the result is positive (indicating that the group A strep antigen was detected and therefore confirming that the person has a group A strep pharyngitis), then it is appropriate to treat the people with scarlet fever with antibiotics. But, if the rapid antigen detection test is negative (indicating that they do not have group A strep pharyngitis), then a throat culture is required to confirm, as the first test could have yielded a false negative result.[34] In the early 21st century, the throat culture is the current \"gold standard\" for diagnosis.[22]\nSerologic testing seeks evidence of the antibodies that the body produces against the streptococcal infection, including antistreptolysin-O and antideoxyribonuclease B. It takes the body 2–3 weeks to make these antibodies, so this type of testing is not useful for diagnosing a current infection. But it is useful when assessing a person who may have one of the complications from a previous streptococcal infection.[16][22]\nThroat cultures done after antibiotic therapy can show if the infection has been removed. These throat swabs, however, are not indicated, because up to 25% of properly treated individuals can continue to carry the streptococcal infection while being asymptomatic.[24]\nScarlet fever might appear similar to Kawasaki disease, which has a characteristic red but not white strawberry tongue, and staphylococcal scarlatina which does not have the strawberry tongue at all.[12] Other conditions that might appear similar include impetigo, erysipelas, measles, chickenpox, and hand-foot-and-mouth disease, and may be distinguished by the pattern of symptoms.[4]",
    "Treatment": "Antibiotics to combat the streptococcal infection are the mainstay of treatment for scarlet fever. Prompt administration of appropriate antibiotics decreases the length of illness. Peeling of the outer layer of skin, however, will happen despite treatment.[5] One of the main goals of treatment is to prevent the child from developing one of the suppurative or nonsuppurative complications, especially acute rheumatic fever.[22] As long as antibiotics are started within nine days, it is very unlikely for the child to develop acute rheumatic fever.[21] Antibiotic therapy has not been shown to prevent the development of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.[5] Another important reason for prompt treatment with antibiotics is the ability to prevent transmission of the infection between children. An infected individual is most likely to pass on the infection to another person during the first two weeks.[24] A child is no longer contagious (able to pass the infection to another child) after 24 hours of antibiotics.[21]\nThe antibiotic of choice is Penicillin V which is taken by mouth. In countries without a liquid Penicillin V product, children unable to take tablets can be given amoxicillin which comes in a liquid form and is equally effective. Duration of treatment is 10 days.[22] Benzathine penicillin G can be given as a one time intramuscular injection as another alternative if swallowing pills is not possible.[43] If the person is allergic to the family of antibiotics which both penicillin and amoxicillin are a part of (beta-lactam antibiotics), a first generation cephalosporin is used.[34] Cephalosporin antibiotics, however, can still cause adverse reactions in people whose allergic reaction to penicillin is a Type 1 Hypersensitivity reaction. In those cases it is appropriate to choose clindamycin or erythromycin instead.[34] Tonsillectomy, although once a reasonable treatment for recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis, is not indicated, as a person can still be infected with group A streptococcus without their tonsils.[24]\nA drug-resistant strain of scarlet fever, resistant to macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin, but retaining drug-sensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin, emerged in Hong Kong in 2011, accounting for at least two deaths in that city—the first such in over a decade.[44] About 60% of circulating strains of the group A streptococcus that cause scarlet fever in Hong Kong are resistant to macrolide antibiotics, according to Professor Yuen Kwok-yung, head of Hong Kong University's microbiology department. Previously, observed resistance rates had been 10–30%; the increase is likely the result of overuse of macrolide antibiotics in recent years.[citation needed]\nThere was also an outbreak in the UK in 2014, and the National Health Service reported a 68% increase in the number of S. pyogenes identified in laboratory reports between 2014 and 2018.[10]\nNew research published in October 2020 indicates that the bacterium appears to be getting more robust after being infected with viruses,[10] specifically the North-East Asian serotype M12 (emm12) (group A Streptococcus, GAS).[45] They found three new genes, acquired from viruses, which cause development of \"superantigens\" targeting white blood cells, resulting in a more virulent strain of the bacterium.[10]\nA vaccine that will protect against the 180 to 200 types of bacteria causing the disease has been worked on for over 20 years, but as of 2020[update] a safe one had not yet been developed.[10]",
    "Epidemiology": "Scarlet fever occurs equally in both males and females.[16] Children are most commonly infected, typically between 5–15 years old. Although streptococcal infections can happen at any time of year, infection rates peak in the winter and spring months, typically in colder climates.[21]\nThe morbidity and mortality of scarlet fever has declined since the 18th and 19th centuries when there were epidemics of this disease.[46] Around 1900 the mortality rate in multiple places reached 25%.[47] The improvement in prognosis can be attributed to the use of penicillin in the treatment of this disease.[13] The frequency of scarlet fever cases has also been declining over the past century.\nThere have been several reported outbreaks of the disease in various countries in the past decade.[48] The reason for these increases remains unclear in the medical community. Between 2013 and 2016 population rates of scarlet fever in England increased from 8.2 to 33.2 per 100,000 and hospital admissions for scarlet fever increased by 97%.[49] Further increases in the reporting of scarlet fever cases have been noted in England during the 2021–2022 season (September to September) and so far also in the season 2022–2023.[50] The World Health Organization has reported an increase in scarlet fever (and iGAS – invasive GAS cases) in England, and other European countries during this time. Increases have been reported in France and Ireland.[51] In the US, cases of scarlet fever are not reported, but as of December 2022, the CDC was looking at a possible increase in the numbers of invasive GAS infections reported in children.[52] In late December 2022, the CDC's Health Alert Network issued an advisory on the reported increases in invasive GAS infections.[53]"

    "Disease": "Schmitt Gillenwater Kelly syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The family had hypoplastic radii, which resulted in approximately 50% shorter radii. Because of this, the ulna was bowed outwards with outermost part of the ulna being pushed towards the skin. This resulted in a shorter reach.",
    "Causes": "Although more research is needed, the genetic cause of radial hypoplasia is believed to come from a rare allele of the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) gene.[3] This gene produces the Shh protein that induces development of the ulna, and the index, middle, ring, and pinky fingers while increasing the expression of fibroblast growth factor (FGF), another signaling molecule, which induces development of the radius and thumb. Both Shh and FGF are widely expressed during early embryo development.[4][5] When this rare allele of Shh gene is expressed, the result is reduced Shh protein production, which hampers FGF expression, potentially leading to radial hypoplasia.[6]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment usually begins after birth and minor cases involve stretching, manipulation, and splinting. The goal of surgery is to increase length and straighten forearm and thumb reconstruction.[3]",

    "Disease": "Schnitzler syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The typical onset is at around 55 years old, and the symptoms are recurrent hives, mostly on the torso and limbs, often with recurring fever, joint pain, bone pain, muscle pain, headache, fatigue, and loss of weight.[1]",
    "Causes": "As of 2017 the cause of the disease was not understood.[1] A 2024 review by Braud and  Lipsker aimed to \"describe what is currently known about the pathogenesis of this peculiar disease, as well as to address its diagnosis and management\" and concluded that \"physiopathology of Schnitzler syndrome remains elusive\" and \"the main question regarding the relationship between the autoinflammatory features and the monoclonal gammopathy remains to be answered\".[3]",
    "Diagnosis": "Blood tests show a high concentration of specific gamma-globulins (monoclonal gammopathy) of the IgM type. It almost always has light chains of the κ-type. A variant in which IgG is raised has been described, which appears to be one-tenth as common. The immunoglobulins may show up in the urine as Bence Jones proteins. Signs of inflammation are often present: these include an increased white blood cell count (leukocytosis) and a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. There can be anemia of chronic disease.[4] Bone abnormalities can be seen on radiological imaging (often increased density or osteosclerosis) or  biopsy.[1]\nThere are two sets of diagnostic criteria, the Lipsker criteria published in 2001 and the Strasbourg criteria that were produced at a meeting in that city in 2012.[1]\nThe Lipsker criteria require hives, the presence of monoclonal IgM, and at least 2 of the following: fever, joint pain or arthritis, bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, enlarged spleen or liver, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, high levels of white blood cells, and findings of problems in bone imaging.[1][4]\nIn the Strasbourg criteria, the person must have hives and the presence of monoclonal IgM or IgG.  Schnitzler's is diagnosed if the person has IgM and two of the following, or IgG and three of the following: recurrent fevers, abnormalities in bone imaging, with or without bone pain, findings of neutrophil infiltration in a skin biopsy, high levels of white blood cells or C-reactive protein.[1][5]\nOther conditions which can cause periodic fevers, paraproteins or chronic hives that should be ruled out, include (and are not limited to) autoimmune or autoinflammatory disorders such as adult-onset Still's disease, angioedema, hematological disorders such as lymphoma or monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), other causes of hives, cryoglobulinemia, mastocytosis, chronic neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease or Muckle–Wells syndrome.[1][6]",
    "Treatment": "As of 2017, no drug was approved to treat Schnitzlers. Drugs that inhibit interleukin 1 activity have been the preferred treatment since they emerged in 2005; since 2012 a consensus guideline has recommended treatment with anakinra.  Immunosuppressant drugs such as corticosteroids, cyclooxygenase inhibitors, interferon alpha may be effective.[1] A 2020 review reported that canakinumab was \"an effective long-term treatment with a favorable safety profile in patients with Schnitzler syndrome\".[7]\nIn June 2018 NHS England published a Clinical Commissioning Policy: Anakinra to treat periodic fevers and autoinflammatory disorders (all ages) which stated that \"Anakinra\nmay be used as a first line treatment in patients with a documented diagnosis of Schnitzler syndrome\".[8]\nBecause anakinra is so highly and rapidly effective for inducing complete remission of Schnitzler syndrome, it has been suggested that in patients who do not respond to anakinra, the diagnosis should be reconsidered.[9] Anakinra is not curative, however; symptoms recur soon after treatment stops.[10]",
    "Prognosis": "Generally treatment with anakinra prevents outbreaks but they resume if treatment is stopped.[1] In around 15–20% of people, a lymphoproliferative disorder as a complication, most commonly Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, develops. AA amyloidosis has also been reported in people with Schnitzler syndrome.[1]\nThe life span in patients with Schnitzler syndrome has not been shown to differ much from the general population.[11]",
    "Epidemiology": "It is a rare condition; as of September 2014, 281 cases had been reported[10] and as of 2017 around 300 cases had been reported.[1] In December 2024 it was calculated that 748 cases had been reported worldwide.[12]"

    "Causes": "Schwartz–Jampel syndrome is caused by mutations in the HSPG2 gene, which makes the protein perlecan, which is found in muscle and cartilage.[3] Relationships between the disease and perlecan deficiency have been studied.[4] In Schwartz–Jampel syndrome, it is suspected that abnormal perlecan function leads to a deficiency in acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme involved in breaking down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which incites muscle contraction. If acetylcholine is not broken down, it can lead to prolonged muscle contraction/stiffening of the muscles (myotonia).[3] The condition is believed to follow an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, although some reported cases suggest an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.[5]",
    "Diagnosis": "Schwartz–Jampel syndrome is diagnosed on the basis of characteristic facial features, skeletal features and myotonia. Blood tests may show elevated serum creatine kinase or aldolase. X-rays, muscle biopsy or electromyography (EMG) may be useful. Genetic testing for the HSPG2 gene may confirm diagnosis.[3]",
    "Treatment": "There is no cure for Schwartz–Jampel syndrome. Treatment is aimed at reducing muscle stiffness and cramping and may include massage, muscle warming and gradual strengthening exercises. Muscle relaxants or anti-seizure medications, especially carbamazepine, may be used. Eye symptoms such as blepharospasm might be relieved by Botox. Otherwise, a variety of surgical procedures have been found to be effective. Malignant hyperthermia, a potential complication of surgery, is a greater risk for people Schwartz–Jampel syndrome and an important consideration when considering surgery.[3]",
    "Prognosis": "Most people with Schwartz–Jampel syndrome have a nearly normal life expectancy.[3]",
    "Society and culture": "In March 2013, there was media coverage of a British 7-year-old boy named Owen, with chronically tense muscles due to SJS, and his three-legged pet dog. They became first-place winners of the 2013 Crufts Kennel Club's annual Friends for Life competition, which \"celebrates dogs that have truly earned the title of man’s best friend through bravery, support or companionship\".[8][9][10] The dog was also awarded The Braveheart Honour in the ceremony of The British Animal Honours in April 2013 (Haatchi the dog).

    "Disease": "Scleroderma",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Potential signs and symptoms include:[13][14][15][16]",
    "Causes": "Scleroderma is caused by genetic and environmental factors.[4][5][17][18] Mutations in HLA genes seem to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of some cases; likewise silica, aromatic and chlorinated solvents, ketones, trichloroethylene, welding fumes, and white spirits exposure seems to contribute to the condition in a small proportion of affected persons.[4][5][17][18][19]",
    "Diagnosis": "Typical scleroderma is classically defined as symmetrical skin thickening, with about 70% of cases also presenting with Raynaud's phenomenon, nail-fold capillary changes, and antinuclear antibodies. Affected individuals may experience systemic organ involvement. No single test for scleroderma works all of the time; hence, diagnosis is often a matter of exclusion. Atypical scleroderma may show any variation of these changes without skin changes or with finger swelling only.[28]\nLaboratory testing can show antitopoisomerase antibodies, like anti-scl70 (causing a diffuse systemic form), or anticentromere antibodies (causing a limited systemic form and the CREST syndrome). Other autoantibodies can be seen, such as anti-U3 or anti-RNA polymerase.[29]\nAntidouble-stranded DNA  autoantibodies are likely to be present in serum.[citation needed]\nDiseases that are often in the differential include:[30]\nScleroderma is characterised by the appearance of circumscribed or diffuse, hard, smooth, ivory-colored areas that are immobile and which give the appearance of hidebound skin, a disease occurring in both localised and systemic forms:[31]",
    "Treatment": "No cure for scleroderma is known, although relief of symptoms is often achieved; these include treatment of:[13][32]\nSystemic disease-modifying treatment with immunosuppressants is often used.[17][33][34][35][36][37] Immunosuppressants used in its treatment include azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate, intravenous immunoglobulin, rituximab, sirolimus, alefacept, and the tyrosine kinase inhibitors, imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib.[17][32][33][34][35][36][37][38]\nExperimental therapies under investigation include endothelin receptor antagonists, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, beta-glycan peptides, halofuginone, basiliximab, alemtuzumab, abatacept, and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.[39][40]",
    "Prognosis": "As of 2012[update], the five-year survival rate for systemic scleroderma was about 85%, whereas the 10-year survival rate was just under 70%.[44] This varies according to the subtype; while localized scleroderma rarely results in death, the systemic form can, and the diffuse systemic form carries a worse prognosis than the limited form. The major scleroderma-related causes of death are: pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis, and scleroderma renal crisis.[29] People with scleroderma are also at a heightened risk for developing osteoporosis and for contracting cancer (especially liver, lung, haematologic, and bladder cancers).[45] Scleroderma is also associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.[46]\nAccording to a study of an Australian cohort, between 1985 and 2015, the average life expectancy of a person with scleroderma increased from 66 years to 74 years (the average Australian life expectancy increased from 76 to 82 years in the same period).[47]",
    "Epidemiology": "Scleroderma most commonly first presents between the ages of 20 and 50 years, although any age group can be affected.[13][29] Women are four to nine times more likely to develop scleroderma than men.[29]\nThis disease is found worldwide.[29] In the United States, prevalence is estimated at 240 per million, and the annual incidence of scleroderma is 19 per million people.[29] Likewise, in the United States, it is slightly more common in African Americans than in their white counterparts. Choctaw Native Americans are more likely than Americans of European descent to develop the type of scleroderma that affects internal organs.[29] In Germany, the prevalence is between 10 and 150 per million people, and the annual incidence is between three and 28 per million people.[44] In South Australia, the annual incidence is 23 per million people, and the prevalence 233 per million people.[48]"

    "Disease": "Simpson%E2%80%93Golabi%E2%80%93Behmel syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "May include one or more of the following symptons:[citation needed]",
    "Causes": "Although not all causes of SGBS have been identified, one cause of SGBS type I is a mutation of the glypican-3 gene (GPC3) on the X chromosome locus q26.1. This particular gene is widely expressed, especially in tissues derived from the mesoderm during fetal development. The function of this gene is to produce a protein that acts as a cell surface receptor that binds to transcription factors. Binding of the transcription factors allows regulation of cellular responses to growth factors such as members of the hedgehog protein family. When large or small deletions and missense mutations occur along the GPC3 gene, GPC3 can no longer negatively regulate Hedgehog signaling during development, therefore increasing cell proliferation and the risk of developing cancer.[3] Limb patterning and skeletal development may also go awry when GPC3 mutations inhibit regulations of responses to bone morphogenetic proteins, another type of growth factor.[4]\nIt has been suggested that SGBS type II may be caused by duplication of the GPC4 gene, which helps to regulate cell division and growth.[5]\nAlso, some patients diagnosed with SGBS do not have any GPC3 or GPC4 deletions or mutations. Possible explanations include promoter mutation or silencing of the GPC3 gene causing reduced expression in these patients.[6]",
    "Diagnosis": "Detection usually begins with a routine doctor visit when the fundal height is being measured or during an ultrasound examination. When large for gestational age fetuses (LGA) are identified, there are two common causes: maternal diabetes or incorrect dates. However, if these two causes can be ruled out, an ultrasound is performed to detect for overgrowth and other abnormalities. At this point, it becomes essential for a clinical geneticist to assist in the correct selection of tests and possible diagnosis.[8]\nFirst signs of SGBS may be observed as early as 16 weeks of gestation. Aids to diagnosing might include the presence of macrosomia, polyhydramnios, elevated maternal serum-α-fetoprotein, cystic hygroma, hydrops fetalis, increased nuchal translucency, craniofacial abnormalities, visceromegaly, renal abnormalities, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, polydactyly, and a single umbilical artery.[5]\nIf there is a known mutation in the family, prenatal testing is available. Prenatal testing is also possible by looking for evidence of SGBS phenotype in the mother and the positive SGBS phenotype in male family members. Family members who have SGBS may undergo mutational analysis of genes GPC3, GPC4, and CXORF5. Genomic balance in Xp22 and Xq26 may also be analyzed through array comparative genomic hybridization. Evaluation by a medical geneticist is recommended for those strong indications or likelihood of SGBS and for immediate relatives of those genetically confirmed to have SGBS.[5]\nDue to the high percentage of male deaths during the neonatal period, early detection of tumors is crucial. In order to detect the presence of tumors, screening in SGBS patients should include abdominal ultrasound, urinalysis, and biochemical markers that screen for embryonic tumors.[8]\nPET scan with CT is recommended for accurate diagnostic procedure in adult SGBS patients who have manifested tumors and or cysts, especially those of the kidneys, lungs, and or patients which express atypical lesion of the liver or who may be suspect for neuroblastoma.[citation needed]\nOnce the infant is born, possibility of hypoglycemia must be assessed along with cardiac, genitalia, liver, and adrenal evaluations. Such tests include chest radiographs, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, renal sonography, and abdominal sonography and CT to test for possible abnormalities.[9]",
    "Treatment": "Since the syndrome is caused by a genetic mutation in the individual's DNA, a cure is not available. Treatment of the symptoms and management of the syndrome, however, is possible.[citation needed]\nDue to the likelihood of patients developing tumors, full body CT scans are a recommended diagnostic tool. As there have been cases in which the genetic mutation is accompanied by further genetic presence of the bard 1 gene and presence of triple negative cancers, those with such dual expressions cannot rely upon standardized biopy for determination of cancer, but should resort to further diagnostic tools (i.e. those such as pet scans which measure chemical and decay rate factors for diagnosis).[citation needed]\nDepending on the manifestation, surgery, special dietary consideration in the event of gastrointestinal affectations, special education, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and physical therapy are some methods of managing the syndrome and associated symptoms.[10]"

    "Disease": "Sirenomelia",
    "Causes": "The ultimate cause of sirenomelia is a subject of debate. The first hypothesis of its origin was developed in 1927 and proposed that a lack of blood supply to the lower limbs during their development is responsible for the defect. This \"vascular steal\" hypothesis was developed in response to the observed absence or severe underdevelopment of the aorta below the umbilical artery, which \"steals\" the blood supply from the lower limbs. Other hypotheses involve an insult to the embryo between 28 and 32 days affecting the caudal mesoderm, a teratogen exposure affecting the neural tube during neurulation, and a defect in the twinning process that either stops the process of caudal differentiation or generates a second primitive streak.[1]\nMaternal diabetes mellitus has been associated with caudal regression syndrome and sirenomelia,[5][6] although a few sources question this association.[7] Prenatal cocaine exposure has also been suggested as an association with sirenomelia.[1]\nIn animal models, several genes have been found to cause or be associated with sirenomelia. The srn (siren) gene is observed to cause hindlimb fusion in homozygous mice.[1][8] Mice with knockouts or mutations in both tsg1 and bmp7 will also have hindlimb fusion.[1][9][10]",
    "Diagnosis": "Though obvious at birth, sirenomelia can be diagnosed as early as 14 weeks gestation on prenatal ultrasound. When there is low amniotic fluid around the fetus (oligohydramnios), the diagnosis is more difficult.[1]",
    "Prognosis": "Sirenomelia is usually fatal. Many pregnancies with a sirenomelic fetus spontaneously miscarry. One-third to one-half of infants are stillborn, with all but a few dying in the neonatal period.[1]\nIn cases of monoamniotic twins where one is affected, the twin with sirenomelia is protected from Potter sequence (particularly pulmonary hypoplasia and abnormal facies) by the normal twin's production of amniotic fluid.[11][1]",

    "Disease": "Slipped capital femoral epiphysis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Usually, a SCFE causes groin pain, but it may cause pain in only the thigh or knee, because the pain may be referred along the distribution of the obturator nerve.[2] The pain may occur on both sides of the body (bilaterally), as up to 40 percent of cases involve slippage on both sides.[3] In cases of bilateral SCFEs, they typically occur within one year of each other.[4]  About 20 percent of all cases include a SCFE on both sides at the time of presentation.[5]\nSigns of a SCFE include a waddling gait, decreased range of motion. Often the range of motion in the hip is restricted in internal rotation, abduction, and flexion.[2] A person with a SCFE may prefer to hold their hip in flexion and external rotation.[citation needed]\nFailure to treat a SCFE may lead to: death of bone tissue in the femoral head (avascular necrosis), degenerative hip disease (hip osteoarthritis),[6] gait abnormalities and chronic pain.  SCFE is associated with a greater risk of arthritis of the hip joint later in life.[6] 17–47 percent of acute cases of SCFE lead to the death of bone tissue (osteonecrosis) effects.[2]",
    "Causes": "In general, SCFE is caused by increased force applied across the epiphysis, or a decrease in the resistance within the physis to shearing.[4] Obesity is the by far the most significant risk factor. A study in Scotland looked at the weight of 600,000 infants, and followed them up to see who got SCFE.[1] This study identified that obese children had an almost twenty times greater risk than thin children, with a 'dose-response'- so the greater the weight of the child, the greater the risk of SCFE. In 65 percent of cases of SCFE, the person is over the 95th percentile for weight.[2] Endocrine diseases may also contribute (though are far less of a risk than obesity), such as hypothyroidism, hypopituitarism, and renal osteodystrophy.[2][7]\nSometimes no single cause accounts for SCFE, and several factors play a role in the development of a SCFE i.e. both mechanical and endocrine (hormone-related) factors. Skeletal changes may also make someone at risk of SCFE, including femoral or acetabular retroversion,[4] those these may simply be chronic skeletal manifestations of childhood obesity.",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is a combination of clinical suspicion plus radiological investigation.  Children with a SCFE experience a decrease in their range of motion, and are often unable to complete hip flexion or fully rotate the hip inward.[10]  20–50% of SCFE are missed or misdiagnosed on their first presentation to a medical facility.[citation needed]  SCFEs may be initially overlooked, because the first symptom is knee pain, referred from the hip.  The knee is investigated and found to be normal.[7]\nThe diagnosis requires x-rays of the pelvis, with anteriorposterior (AP) and frog-leg lateral views.[11]  The appearance of the head of the femur in relation to the shaft likens that of a \"melting ice cream cone\", visible with Klein's line.  The severity of the disease can be measured using the Southwick angle.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "The disease can be treated with external in-situ pinning or open reduction and pinning.  Consultation with an orthopaedic surgeon is necessary to repair this problem.  Pinning the unaffected side prophylactically is not recommended for most patients, but may be appropriate if a second SCFE is very likely.[11]\nOnce SCFE is suspected, the patient should be non-weight bearing and remain on strict bed rest. In severe cases, after enough rest the patient may require physical therapy to regain strength and movement back to the leg. A SCFE is an orthopaedic emergency, as further slippage may result in occlusion of the blood supply and avascular necrosis (risk of 25 percent).  Almost all cases require surgery, which usually involves the placement of one or two pins into the femoral head to prevent further slippage.[12]  The recommended screw placement is in the center of the epiphysis and perpendicular to the physis.[13] Chances of a slippage occurring in the other hip are 20 percent within 18 months of diagnosis of the first slippage and consequently the opposite unaffected femur may also require pinning.[citation needed]\nThe risk of reducing this fracture includes the disruption of the blood supply to the bone.  It has been shown in the past that attempts to correct the slippage by moving the head back into its correct position can cause the bone to die.  Therefore the head of the femur is usually pinned 'as is'. A small incision is made in the outer side of the upper thigh and metal pins are placed through the femoral neck and into the head of the femur. A dressing covers the wound.[citation needed]",
    "Epidemiology": "SCFE affects approximately 1–10 per 100,000 children.[4]  The incidence varies by geographic location, season of the year, and ethnicity.[4] In eastern Japan, the incidence is 0.2 per 100,000 and in the northeastern U.S. it is about 10 per 100,000.[2] Africans and Polynesians have higher rates of SCFE.[2]\nSCFEs are most common in adolescents 11–15 years of age,[6] and affects boys more frequently than girls (male 2:1 female).[2][4]  It is strongly linked to obesity, and weight loss may decrease the risk.[14]  Other risk factors include: family history, endocrine disorders, radiation / chemotherapy, and mild trauma.\nThe left hip is more often affected than the right.[2] Over half of cases may have involvement on both sides (bilateral).[2]"

    "Disease": "Sly syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The most severe cases of Sly syndrome can result in hydrops fetalis, which results in fetal death or death soon after birth. Some people with Sly syndrome may begin to have symptoms in early childhood. Symptoms can include an enlarged head, fluid buildup in the brain, coarse facial features, enlarged tongue, enlarged liver, enlarged spleen, problems with the heart valves, and abdominal hernias. People with Sly syndrome may also have sleep apnea, frequent lung infections, and problems with vision secondary to cloudy corneas. Sly syndrome causes various musculoskeletal abnormalities that worsen with age. These can include short stature, joint deformities, dysostosis multiplex, spinal stenosis, and carpal tunnel syndrome.[1]\nWhile some individuals have developmental delay, others may have normal intelligence.[1] However, the accumulation of GAGs in the brain usually leads to the slowing of development from ages 1–3, and then a loss of previously learned skills until death.[2]",
    "Diagnosis": "Most people with Sly disease will have elevated levels of GAGs seen in the urine. A confirmatory test is necessary for diagnosis. Skin cells and red blood cells of affected people will have low levels of β-glucuronidase activity. Sly syndrome can also be diagnosed through prenatal testing.[2]",
    "Treatment": "Vestronidase alfa-vjbk (trade name Mepsevii), an enzyme replacement therapy which is a recombinant form of human β-glucuronidase, is approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of Sly syndrome.[4] Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) has been used to treat other types of MPS diseases, but this is not yet available for MPS-VII. Animal experiments suggest that HSCT may be an effective treatment for MPS-VII in humans.[2]",
    "Prognosis": "The life expectancy of individuals with MPS VII varies depending on the symptoms. Some individuals are stillborn, while some may survive into adulthood.[1]",
    "Epidemiology": "MPS-VII is one of the rarest forms of MPS. It occurs in less than 1 in 250,000 births. As a family, MPS diseases occur in 1 in 25,000 births, and the larger family of lysosomal storage diseases occur in 1 out of 7,000 to 8,000 births.[2]"

    "Disease": "Small-cell carcinoma",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Small-cell carcinoma of the lung usually presents in the central airways and infiltrates the submucosa leading to the narrowing of bronchial airways. Common symptoms include cough, dyspnea, weight loss, and debility. Over 70% of patients with small-cell carcinoma present with metastatic disease; common sites include the liver, adrenals, bone, and brain.[24][25]\nDue to its high grade neuroendocrine nature, small-cell carcinomas can produce ectopic hormones, including adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and anti-diuretic hormone (ADH).[5] Ectopic production of large amounts of ADH leads to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone hypersecretion (SIADH).[26][13] Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome is a well-known paraneoplastic condition linked to small-cell carcinoma.[27][5] Approximately half of all individuals diagnosed with Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome will eventually be found to have a small-cell carcinoma of the lung.[27]",
    "Diagnosis": "Small-cell carcinoma is an undifferentiated neoplasm composed of primitive-appearing cells. As the name implies, the cells in small-cell carcinomas are smaller than normal cells and barely have room for any cytoplasm. Some researchers identify this as a failure in the mechanism that controls the size of the cells.[32]\nAt the time of diagnosis, 60–70% of people already have metastases.[14]\nChest X-rays are typically the first step to evaluate someone for any type of lung cancer. If images show suspicious spots on the patient's lung, a healthcare provider may order chest CT, PET, needle biopsy or bronchoscopy for further check.[33]\nIt is possible to use bronchoscopic biopsy to diagnose Lung small-cell carcinoma. However, small-cell carcinoma tissue obtained through bronchoscopy is prone to tissue compression and unclear morphology. However, pathologists can stain lesions with immunohistochemistry Ki-67, CD56, TTF-1, CgA, Syn, P63, CK5/6, LCA, and 34βE12 to help, in order to make a differential diagnosis.[34]\nThe common metastasis sites of SCLC include the lung, brain, bone, adrenal gland, liver, colorectum, and lymph nodes.\nIf the tumor metastasises to the brain, It is necessary to comprehensively evaluate the patient's condition in combination with PET/CT and MRI. In patients with brain metastases from small cell lung cancer, MRI has specificity and sensitivity of 75% to 90% and 70% to 85%, respectively.[35] In MRI, T1- and T2-weighted images had medium-to-high signal intensity.[36] Presently, brain metastasis diagnosis by FDG-PET/CT often uses TBR ≥1.6 of increased absorption as the appropriate diagnostic index for positive brain metastasis.[36][37] Researchers also found cerebellum is the risk site with a high incidence of metastasis.[38] In patients with SCLC brain metastasis, the general manifestation on plain CT is of low and medium density, and high-density signals of lesions are rare. However, the imaging with enhanced CT is more clear, showing obvious enhanced signals of cancer lesions. The extensive low-density edema zone of finger edema can be observed.[37] What's more, it is difficult to detect small metastasis in the brain <0.5 cm, which contributes to the high false-positive rate of brain CT.[36][39]",
    "Treatment": "In cases of LS-SCLC, combination chemotherapy is administered together with concurrent chest radiotherapy.[40][41][42] Chest radiotherapy has been shown to improve survival in LS-SCLC.[43] Because SCLC usually metastasizes widely very early on in the natural history of the tumor, and because nearly all cases respond dramatically to chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, there has been little role for surgery in this disease since the 1970s.[44] However, in cases of small, asymptomatic, node-negative SCLC's (\"very limited stage\"), surgical excision may improve survival when used prior to chemotherapy.[45]\nIn ES-SCLC, platinum-based combination chemotherapy is the standard of care.[46]\nCombination chemotherapy consists of a wide variety of agents, including cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine and carboplatin. Response rates are high even in extensive disease, with between 15% and 30% of subjects having a complete response to a combination chemotherapy, and the vast majority having at least some objective response. Responses in ES-SCLC are often of short duration, and the evidence surrounding the risk of treatment compared to the potential benefit of chemotherapy for people who have extensive SCLC is not clear.[46]\nSmall-cell lung cancer is most commonly treated with chemotherapy in a combination of two drugs, which is more effective than one drug alone.\nThe drug paclitaxel may be useful in the treatment of cisplatin-resistant cancer. About 68.1% of cisplatin-resistant cells appear to be sensitive to paclitaxel and 66.7% of paclitaxel-resistant cells to cisplatin. The mechanism for this activity is unknown.[47] Paclitaxel-based chemotherapy showed modest activity in SCLC patients refractory to both etoposide- and camptothecin-based chemotherapy.[48] The newer agent lurbinectedin is active in relapsed SCLC and was approved for medical use in the United States in June 2020.[49][50][51][52][53]\nThe FDA has approved three immunotherapies for small cell lung cancer:\nCanadian regulator rejected funding Tecentriq (Atezolizumab) for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer in 2020 \"as too costly\" followed by the United Kingdom also citing \"drug's cost-effectiveness.\"[60][61]\nChest radiation helps SCLC patients live longer by killing cancer cells and helping prevention of cancer recurrence.[62] Another type of radiation, prophylactic cranial radiation, prevents central nervous system recurrence and can improve survival in patients with good performance status who have had a complete response or very good partial response to chemoradiation in LD or chemotherapy in ED.[41]\nIf small cell lung cancer comes back after treatment, the following combination of drugs may be used as salvage therapy:[63]\nGuidelines recommended as of 2018 that patients who relapse > 6 months from initial therapy should be retreated with the original chemotherapy regimen. For patients who relapse in < 6 months, single-agent chemotherapy either topotecan second-line therapy, or paclitaxel can be used.[65]\nSeveral newer agents, including temozolomide and bendamustine, have activity in relapsed SCLC. Of note, temozolomide yielded a response rate of 38% for brain metastases due to SCLC.[65]\nIn a clinical trial of 50 patients, a combination of olaparib and temozolomide in relapsed small-cell lung cancer yielded an overall response rate of 41.7%, median progression-free survival of 4.2 months, and overall survival was 8.5 months.[66]\nLurbinectedin showed an increased overall survival rate in relapsed small cell lung cancer in a trial.[67] Lurbinectedin is As of 2019[update] available in the U.S. under an expanded access program (EAP).[68][69][70]\nTrilaciclib, a CKD4/6 inhibitor, reduces chemotherapy-induced toxicity in patients being treated for small-cell lung cancer.[71][72][73]\nIn 2021, the FDA approved trilaciclib (Cosela) as a treatment to reduce the frequency of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression for patients receiving certain types of chemotherapy for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer.[74]",
    "Prognosis": "As of 2015, 5-year survival rates for small cell lung cancer (extensive and limited) range between 3.6% and 32.2% for women, and between 2.2% and 24.5% for men.[75] Relative 5-year survival rate for both sexes has increased from 3.6% in 1975 to 6.7% in 2014.[75] In limited-stage disease, the relative 5-year survival rate (both sexes, all races, all ages) is 21.3%; however, women have higher 5-year survival rates, 26.9%, and men have lower survival rates, 21.3%.[76] The prognosis is far grimmer in extensive-stage small-cell lung carcinoma where 5-year relative survival rate (both sexes, all races, all ages) is 2.8%; however, women have higher 5-year survival rates, 3.4%, and men have lower 5-year survival rates, 2.2%.[76]\nSmall-cell carcinoma is very responsive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and in particular, regimens based on platinum-containing agents. However, most people with the disease relapse, and median survival remains low. The overall incidence and mortality rates of SCLC in the United States have decreased during the past few decades.[77]\nLong-term survival of more than 5 years can be achieved with proper treatment. According to the 17th World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC), \"patients who received chest radiation and prophylactic cranial irradiation along with a mean of five chemotherapy cycles could achieve a median survival of more than 5 years.\"[78][75] In some cases, long-term survival of 10+ years is achieved with chemotherapy and radiation alone.[79][80]\nA 2023 article stated that the median overall survival is about 1 year, the worst of any lung cancer subtype.[81]",
    "Epidemiology": "Small cell lung carcinoma accounts for 15% of lung cancers in the United States.[83] Small cell lung cancer occurs almost exclusively in smokers – most commonly in heavy smokers and rarely in non-smokers.[84][85]",
    "Society and culture": "In 2013, the US Congress passed the Recalcitrant Cancer Research Act, which mandated increased attention to certain recalcitrant cancers (cancers having a 5-year relative survival rate of less than 50%), including small cell lung cancer. That led to the National Cancer Institute supporting small cell-specific research.[86][87]"

    "Disease": "Sneddon%27s syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Sneddon's syndrome generally manifests with stroke or severe, transient neurological symptoms, and a skin rash (livedo reticularis). Livedo reticularis appears as a bluish-purple, netlike mottling of the skin.  Sneddon's syndrome may instead present with livedo racemosa, which involves larger, less organized patches of bluish-purple mottling of the skin. Both are generally found first in the extremities, both worsen in cold and either may occur without Sneddon's syndrome or any other systemic disease.[citation needed]\nSneddon's syndrome can be characterized by: transient amnesia, transient aphasia, palsy, headaches, hypertension, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), stroke,[3] coronary disease and dementia.[4] The skin manifestations may precede the neurologic symptoms by years.[3]",
    "Diagnosis": "There are no diagnostic tests on which all Sneddon's patients will have abnormal results, although brain MRI and skin biopsy are often abnormal. The diagnosis is based on a detailed history and physical examination.  About 40-60% of patients with the syndrome test positive for antiphospholipid antibodies.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Sneddon's patients are generally treated with warfarin, maintaining a high INR of 3–4.[1] Because most will experience significant relief of symptoms after several months of consistent INR in this range, treatment with warfarin is often used as a diagnostic tool.",
    "Epidemiology": "Sneddon's syndrome is a rare condition that is usually misdiagnosed.[3]  It occurs in families and may be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Sneddon's syndrome most often becomes apparent in women in their thirties, though cases do occur in men and in children. Generally, Livedo precedes cerebrovascular involvement by roughly ten years, and many years of cerebrovascular involvement precede the development of dementia, when it occurs.[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "Sotos syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The classic features of Sotos syndrome are a characteristic facial appearance, learning disability, and height and/or weight circumference greater than 2 standard deviations over the mean.[2] Characteristic facial features include a long face, broad forehead, sparse hair over the forehead and side of the head, downslanting palpebral fissures, narrow jaw, long chin, and flushing of the cheeks.[2] The facial appearance is most notable in early childhood. Affected infants and children tend to grow quickly; they are significantly taller than their siblings and peers, and have an unusually large skull and large head.[2] Adult height is usually in the normal range, although Broc Brown has the condition and was named the world's tallest teenager; as of late 2016, he was 2.34 m (7 ft 8 in) tall and still growing.[3][2]\nIndividuals with Sotos syndrome often have intellectual impairment,[4][5] and most also display behavioral impairments.[6] During early development, these individuals may have delayed motor skills, poor coordination, and problems with feeding.[2][7] Later on they may have trouble with nonverbal reasoning and quantitative reasoning. Intellectual impairment in Sotos syndrome is usually mild and does not worsen over time.[4] Behavioral impairments may include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), phobias, obsessive compulsive disorder, autism, tantrums, and impulsive behaviors (impulse control disorder). Problems with speech and language are also common.[8] Affected individuals may often have stuttering, difficulty with sound production, or a monotone voice. Additionally, weak muscle tone (hypotonia) may delay other aspects of early development, particularly motor skills such as sitting and crawling.[2]\nOther major features of Sotos syndrome include heart abnormalities, brain abnormalities, joint hypermobility, hearing loss, vision problems, vesicoureteral reflux, scoliosis, and seizures.[2] Signs of Sotos syndrome can be seen in the before birth as well with increased nuchal translucency, large head size, polyhydramnios, fetal overgrowth, renal abnormalities or cranial abnormalities.[9] Those pregnant with an affected fetus may experience maternal pre-eclampsia.[2] Some infants with this disorder experience jaundice and poor feeding at birth.  A small number of patients with Sotos syndrome (about 3%) have developed cancer, most often in childhood, but no single form of cancer has been associated with this condition. Some of the cancers reported in Sotos syndrome include wilms tumor, hepatoblastoma, neuroblastoma, sacrococcygeal teratoma, presacral ganglioma, acute lymphocytic leukemia, small cell lung cancer, and astrocytomas.[2][7] It remains uncertain whether Sotos syndrome increases the risk of specific types of cancer. If persons with this disorder have any increased cancer risk, their risk is only slightly greater than that of the general population.[10]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis of Sotos syndrome is usually made during childhood and is based on clinical examination and bone age.[13] The clinical evaluation begins with a physician conducting a thorough history and physical examination, focusing on signs of excessive growth along with other previously mentioned symptoms. Family history is particularly important to identify any affected family members and provide genetic counseling if necessary.[7] Physicians will also perform an assessment of growth velocity with growth charts and head circumference measurements.[7] Bone age is determined by obtaining an X-ray. Additional diagnostic tests may be performed to rule out other disorders. This includes a complete blood count, karyotype analysis, and measurement of IGF-1, IGFBP-3, free T4, and TSH levels.[7] There are no biochemical markers for Sotos syndrome.[14] The diagnosis is confirmed through genetic testing. Physicians will obtain a blood or saliva sample for genetic testing which looks for a mutation within the NSD1 gene.[2] If there is clinical suspicion of Sotos syndrome in a fetus, physicians may perform genetic testing on the fetus.[9]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment of Sotos syndrome is symptomatic.[14] As an infant, those with Sotos syndrome may require treatment for jaundice, vesicuoureteral reflux, and poor feeding. Children with Sotos syndrome should follow up closely with their primary care provider and any other specialists that are necessary in order to monitor for the development of complications such as seizures, infections, scoliosis, and more as discussed above.[13] Screening for tumors is not recommended as the probability of occurrence is less than 3 percent.[2] Patients should also be connected with occupational therapy, speech therapy, psychology and adaptive physical education to support their unique intellectual and physical needs.[13] Those with Sotos syndrome may additionally require special education classes, but not always.",
    "Prognosis": "Sotos syndrome is not a life-threatening disorder and patients may have a normal life expectancy. Developmental delays may improve in the school-age years; however, coordination problems may persist into adulthood, along with any learning disabilities and/or other physical or mental issues.[15]",

    "Disease": "Spinocerebellar ataxia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is one of a group of genetic disorders characterized by slowly progressive incoordination of gait and is often associated with poor coordination of hands, speech, and eye movements. A review of different clinical features among SCA subtypes was recently published describing the frequency of non-cerebellar features, like parkinsonism, chorea, pyramidalism, cognitive impairment, peripheral neuropathy, seizures, among others.[4] As with other forms of ataxia, SCA frequently results in atrophy of the cerebellum,[5] loss of fine coordination of muscle movements leading to unsteady and clumsy motion, and other symptoms. Ocular deficits can be quantified using the SODA scale.[6]\nThe symptoms of an ataxia vary with the specific type and with the individual patient. Many subtypes of spinocerebellar ataxia result in cases where an individual retains full mental capacity but progressively loses physical control, but nearly half of the identified subtypes result in cognitive dysfunction, dementia, and intellectual disability.[7]",
    "Causes": "The hereditary ataxias are categorized by mode of inheritance and causative gene or chromosomal locus. The hereditary ataxias can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked manner.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "A few SCAs remain unspecified and can not be precisely diagnosed, but in the last decade[as of?] genetic testing has allowed precise identification of dozens of different SCAs  and more tests are being added each year.[11] In 2008, a genetic ataxia blood test developed to test for 12 types of SCA, Friedreich's ataxia, and several others.  However, since not every SCA has been genetically identified some SCAs are still diagnosed  by neurological examination, which  may include a physical exam, family history, MRI scanning of the brain and spine, and spinal tap.[12]\nMany SCAs below fall under the category of polyglutamine diseases, which are caused when a disease-associated protein (i.e., ataxin-1, ataxin-3, etc.) contains a large number of repeats of glutamine residues, termed a polyQ sequence or a \"CAG trinucleotide repeat\" disease for either the one-letter designation or codon for glutamine respectively. The threshold for symptoms in most forms of SCA is around 35, though for SCA3 it extends beyond 50. Most polyglutamine diseases are dominant due to the interactions of resulting polyQ tail.[citation needed]\nThe first ataxia gene was identified in 1993 and called \"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1\" (SCA1); later genes were called SCA2, SCA3, etc. Usually, the \"type\" number of \"SCA\" refers to the order in which the gene was found. At this time, there are at least 49 different gene mutations that have been found.[citation needed]\nThe following is a list of some of the many types of Spinocerebellar ataxia.\nOthers include SCA18, SCA20, SCA21, SCA23, SCA26, SCA28, and SCA29.\nFour X-linked types have been described ( 302500,  302600,  301790,  301840), but only the first of these has so far been tied to a gene (SCAX1).",
    "Treatment": "There is no cure for spinocerebellar ataxia, which is currently considered to be a progressive and irreversible disease, although not all types cause equally severe disability.[28]\nIn general, treatments are directed towards alleviating symptoms, not the disease itself. Many patients with hereditary or idiopathic forms of ataxia have other symptoms in addition to ataxia. Medications or other therapies might be appropriate for some of these symptoms, which could include tremor, stiffness, depression, spasticity, and sleep disorders, among others. Both onset of initial symptoms and duration of disease are variable. If the disease is caused by a polyglutamine trinucleotide repeat CAG expansion, a longer expansion may lead to an earlier onset and a more radical progression of clinical symptoms. Typically, a person with this disease will eventually be unable to perform daily tasks (ADLs).[29] However, rehabilitation therapists can help patients to maximize their ability of self-care and delay deterioration to certain extent.[30] Researchers are exploring multiple avenues for a cure including RNA interference\n(RNAi) technology, the use of stem cells, and several other avenues.[31]\nOn January 18, 2017, BioBlast Pharma announced completion of Phase 2a clinical trials of their medication, trehalose, in the treatment of SCA3.  BioBlast has received FDA Fast Track status and orphan drug status for their treatment.  The information provided by BioBlast in their research indicates that they hope this treatment may prove efficacious in other SCA treatments that have similar pathology related to PolyA and PolyQ diseases.[32][33]\nIn addition, Dr. Beverly Davidson has been working on a methodology using RNAi technology to find a potential cure for over 2 decades.[34]  Her research began in the mid-1990s and progressed to work with mouse models about a decade later and most recently has moved to a study with non-human primates.  The results from her most recent research \"are supportive of clinical application of this gene therapy\".[35]\nFinally, another gene transfer technology discovered in 2011 has also been shown by Boudreau et al. to hold great promise and offers yet another avenue to a potential future cure.[36]\nN-Acetyl-Leucine is an orally administered, modified amino acid that is being developed as a novel treatment for multiple rare and common neurological disorders by IntraBio Inc (Oxford, United Kingdom).[37]\nN-Acetyl-Leucine has been granted multiple orphan drug designations from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA)[38] and the European Medicines Agency (EMA)[39] for the treatment of various genetic diseases, including spinocerebellar ataxias. N-Acetyl-Leucine has also been granted Orphan Drug Designations in the US and EU for the related inherited cerebellar ataxia ataxia-telangiectasia U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA)[40] and the European Medicines Agency (EMA).[41]\nPublished case series studies have demonstrated the effects of acute treatment with N-Acetyl-Leucine for the treatment of inherited cerebellar ataxias, including spinocerebellar ataxias.[42][43] These studies further demonstrated that the treatment is well tolerated, with a good safety profile.[citation needed]\nA multinational clinical trial investigating N-Acetyl-L-Leucine for the treatment of a related inherited cerebellar ataxia, ataxia-telangiectasia, began in 2019.[44]\nIntraBio is also conducting parallel clinical trials with N-Acetyl-L-Leucine for the treatment of Niemann-Pick disease type C[45] and GM2 gangliosidosis (Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff disease).[46] Future opportunities to develop N-Acetyl-Leucine include Lewy body dementia,[47] amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, restless leg syndrome, multiple sclerosis, and migraine.[48]\nPhysical therapists can assist patients in maintaining their level of independence through therapeutic exercise programmes.  One recent research report demonstrated a gain of two SARA points (Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia) from physical therapy.[30] In general, physical therapy emphasises postural balance and gait training for ataxia patients.[49] General conditioning such as range-of-motion exercises and muscle strengthening would also be included in therapeutic exercise programmes.  Research showed that spinocerebellar ataxia 2 (SCA2) patients[50] with a mild stage of the disease gained significant improvement in static balance and neurological indices after six months of a physical therapy exercise training program.[51] Occupational therapists may assist patients with incoordination or ataxia issues through the use of adaptive devices. Such devices may include a cane, crutches, walker, or wheelchair for those with impaired gait. Other devices are available to assist with writing, feeding, and self care if hand and arm coordination are impaired. A randomised clinical trial revealed that an intensive rehabilitation program with physical and occupational therapies for patients with degenerative cerebellar diseases can significantly improve functional gains in ataxia, gait, and activities of daily living. Some level of improvement was shown to be maintained 24 weeks post-treatment.[52] Speech language pathologists may use both behavioral intervention strategies as well as augmentative and alternative communication devices to help patients with impaired speech.[citation needed]"

From the first symptoms, duration is typically between one and three decades, where earlier onset correlates with faster progression.[1]\nSpinocerebellar ataxia 1, like other SCAs, often causes dysarthria, a motor disorder of speech often manifest as slurring of words; pathological nystagmus, a disorder in which eyes drift involuntarily affecting vision; and gait and balance issues. SCA1 is also commonly present with dysphagia, a swallowing disorder that can cause choking while eating and drinking; and hypermetric saccades, where the eye tends to move faster or further than intended as it tracks an object or moves from one focus to another. As the disease progresses, more severe neurologic symptoms can appear like dysmetria, where limb movements consistently overshoot the desired position; dysdiadochokinesia, where repeated body movements become uncoordinated; or hypotonia, where muscles atrophy. While new symptoms appear as SCA1 progresses,  nystagmus may disappear as eye movements and saccades slow down. Fatality may ultimately be caused by loss of bulbar functions, but complications from symptoms, such as pneumonia from swallowing problems, or trauma from falls, can be fatal as well.[1] The severity and exact phenotype of these symptoms may vary between types of SCA. SCA 1 dysarthria may vary in severity depending on the task and is often associated with more strained, strangled or harsh sounding vocalization than that of other disorders.[2]\nBecause of the significant variance between cases of SCA1, typical signs and symptoms may appear alongside more subtle or rare symptoms. Maculopathy has been reported in rare cases, and may be linked effects from the mutation on the ATXN1 locus on genes in neighboring loci.[3] Task specific dystonias have been reported in individual cases, often in the form of writer's cramps[4] or cervical dystonia.[5]\nSCAs can also be detected before serious atrophy with electrophysiologic techniques, using electrodes on the scalp to detect changes in electric potential within the brain in response to sensations or movements. Individuals with SCA1 often exhibit abnormal brainstem auditory evoked potential, including prolonged latency and absent or poorly defined waveforms, with one study reporting 73.3% of test subjects exhibiting abnormalities. The same study also found abnormalities in visual evoked potential and median somatosensory evoked potential in some SCA1 persons. These results were similar to those exhibited in other SCAs and differences between the SCAs were not statistically significant, so electrophysiologic techniques cannot replace genetic testing for specific diagnoses of SCAs.[6]\nAll SCAs cause atrophy in various neural tissues that are detectable using magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, or other imaging techniques. In SCA1 some degradation in the grey matter of the cerebellum and brain stem can sometimes be detected in presymptomatic individuals with the expansion in ATXN1.[7] Typically, grey matter loss can be observed in cerebellar vermis in all lobules of the cerebellum and in the paramedian portions of both hemispheres. White matter loss can also be observed in the middle cerebellar peduncles. The volume loss can be correlated to severity and duration.[8]\nAn estimated 77% of cases of progressive cerebellar disease are reported to have one or more mental health disorders, and 19% exhibit cognitive disorders.[9] These estimates are consistently higher than the portion with mental health disorders in the general population, but still follow other general patterns, like correlations between depression frequency and sex or age. It is unclear if depression can be linked causally to cerebellar degeneration; one study reports data consistent with depression primarily being a response to the disability, not a symptom of it,[10] while another reports evidence that depression may have a causal link; prevalence of depression varies differently between SCA types than does the rate of progression of disability.[11]",
    "Diagnosis": "Most SCAs and other ataxic disorders are clinically heterogeneous, meaning clinical signs and symptoms are similar between diseases and distinguishing between diseases with a neurologic exam alone is difficult.[1] In symptomatic persons, diagnosis of ataxia related disorders often requires a neurological exam, evaluation of neurological and family history, and molecular genetic testing. Absence of a family history does not exclude hereditary causes like spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 because family history may not have been collected or may be unavailable for certain individuals and new cases may originate from anticipation in an allele with a mutable number of repeats.[38]: 2–4  To establish a diagnosis, molecular genetic testing is currently commercially available for 14 SCA types, including SCA1. In cases where SCAs are not present in family history or where family history is unavailable, testing for the 4 most common SCAs will return positive results for 50% of suspected SCA cases.[38]: 11  Individuals who are at risk of inheriting SCA1 but are currently presymptomatic can also be screened with molecular genetic testing.[39]\nGenetic testing is the only definitive way to differentiate between spinocerebellar ataxia types because of the similarity between clinical characteristics of these diseases and the large  variance between cases. Genetic testing is available for many SCA types, including the relatively common types SCA1, 2, 3, 6, and 7; and the less common SCA8, 10, 12, 14, and 17.[39] However, genetic testing is high in cost and has a low diagnostic yield, with positive diagnoses being found in only 24% of tests ordered by a subspecialist and 10% overall.[40]\nGenetic testing can be administered at various stages of disease progression. When genetic testing is administered after the onset of symptoms, the test is said to be diagnostic; in adults prior to onset of symptoms it is presymptomatic, and the test can be performed for prenatal or preimplantation diagnoses. The European Molecular Quality Genetics Network (EMQN) recommends criteria for each type, which must be met before testing can begin. The EQMN recommends that labs receive a written clinical evaluation of symptoms by a neurologist and a disclosure of family history, or lack of history, before initiating diagnostic genetic testing.[41][42] Because no preventative or curative treatments are known for SCAs, genetic testing for at risk individuals is not recommended for all cases, and is typically issued on an individual basis.[43] Presymptomatic, prenatal, and preimplantation testing are typically requested through a genetic counsellor and require existing family history and documentation of informed consent of the consultand.[41][42] Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 was one of the first late onset diseases for which presymptomatic testing was demonstrated effective and predictive; prior to the development of testing for SCA1, Huntington's disease was the only similar disease for which presymptomatic testing was available.[44]\nMolecular genetic testing of SCAs must be able to differentiate samples with the pathogenic allele from those without and be able to accurately measure the number of repeats in repeat expansion disorders. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) is one method that has met these criteria and is recommended by the EMQN.[41][42] Another method that is common is polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Both methods require amplification of all loci of interest for a given test. Amplification is done using polymerase chain reactions or PCR. The choice of primers can allow either for a single gene to be amplified or for many genes to amplified for use in a multiplex assay which can save time in cases where a panel of many tests may be required. PAGE and CE both use timed cycles of electricity to draw pieces of DNA through a porous polymer, separating analytes by a combination of ionic mobility, size and mass. CE is advantageous over PAGE in that molecular weight measurements like mass spectrometry can be used with analytes, whereas PAGE requires the use of Southern blot to allow comparison to a sequencing ladder.[45] For repeat lengths within the range where interruptions are relevant, assays like CE and PAGE will not determine if the strain is pathogenic and additional testing will be required.[41][42]\nNo formal diagnostic criteria exist for most SCAs, and genetic testing is the only certain diagnostic method, but clinical examination of signs and symptoms may be vital to distinguishing SCAs from non-genetic ataxias, and from other types of genetic ataxias. Clinical examination can also help distinguish between SCA types to some extent, so genetic tests for certain types can be prioritized over others. Diagnosis of SCAs often begins with the detection of symptoms that suggest a cerebellar disorder, like progressive ataxia or dysarthria, or with recognition of similar symptoms to a case identified in the individuals family history, especially in first or second degree relatives.[1] Many laboratory studies can be used to further narrow the potential cause of ataxia; imaging of brain and spinal cord and various electrophysiology exams may be useful for identifying disease phenotypes and blood and urine studies may rule out acquired causes.[38]: 4\nWhen evaluating ataxic disorders and their treatments, there are numerous tests that a neurologist may perform. Tests may be evaluated individually or follow a scale for evaluating the ataxia. A cerebellar exam may include saying phrases with many consonants to detect scanning speech, detecting horizontal gaze nystagmus by following a finger with the eyes, performing rapid alternating movements like rotating a hand from palm to back repeatedly, testing the Holmes rebound phenomenon, and testing patellar reflex for hypotonia or hypertonia.[46] Common scales include the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) and Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxic Disorders (SARA) for evaluating the severity of ataxia as a symptom. ICARS measures on a 100 scale, where 0 is normal function and 100 is the highest possible impairment, assigning different point values for different tests.[47] The tests are divided into categories evaluating posture and gait, kinetic functions, speech, and oculomotor functions. While these categories create useful categorization to assess which areas need to be focused on in therapies, this redundancy results in a longer test time, which can skew results of tests performed at the end of a session; and can result in contradictory scores.[48] SARA is a shorter exam, evaluated on a scale of 0 to 40, where again zero is normal function and 40 is highest possible impairment. It comprises eight tests: gait, stance, finger chase, finger-to-nose test, fast alternating hand movements, heel-shin slide, and three limb kinectic function tests.[49]\nDifferential diagnosis of SCAs by clinical methods is difficult because these diseases are clinically heterogenous and there is significant variance between the expression of individual cases. Using clinical information for differential diagnosis is used to prioritize genetic testing not as a stand-alone diagnosis. Many potential differentiating symptoms have been found, and methods of assessing many symptoms and their progression to guide genetic testing have been developed. Even if a specific type of spinocerebellar ataxia cannot be immediately determined clinical history, family history, clinical examination can help distinguish between other ataxias and can help reduce the number of genetic tests needed to identify a type of SCA. Examination of relatives of individuals thought to have sporadic ataxia can often reveal enough family history to identify a transmission mode.[50]\nThere are some common trends that may be useful to discriminate SCAs. SCA1 tends to progress faster than SCA2, 3, and 6, with greater annual change in SARA scores and earlier loss of functions after onset.[51] In the diagnostics of clinical ataxia, imaging may not be useful to distinguish SCA1 from other SCAs as there is significant variance between individual cases and significant overlap between diseases.[31] Vestibulo-ocular reflex can be tested using a video recorded head impulse test or vHIT. In this test, SCA1 typically has normal reflex latency, and does not consistently show a deficit in VOR function, distinguishing it from SCA3 and Friedreich's ataxia.[52] Certain patterns in ocular motor disorders, detectable with video-oculography, appear to typify certain SCA types. While SCA1 was not significantly correlated with a unique pattern, other possible SCAs can be linked  and absence of a vertical nystagmus following horizontal head shaking reduces the likelihood of an SCA6 diagnosis, while the absence of a square wave pattern during fixation reduces the likelihood of SCA3.[53]\nOne possible system for the differential diagnosis of SCA types is to record the progression of symptoms and use Bayesian probability to build a predictive model, or a Bayesian classifier, that compares the observed data to trends like those described above to find the likelihood of each diagnosis to be correct. One such Bayesian classifier was shown to accurately predict 78% of SCA cases out of a cohort with known types of SCA. The sensitivity and specificity for SCA1 within this model was 76.9% and 98.2% respectively. Regional variance in prevalence, symptoms and clinical assessment might still limit the use of this system on large scales, though the system may implemented by individual clinics using their own regional data.[54]",
    "Treatment": "There is currently no cure for Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1. However, some of its symptoms may be managed with physical, occupational or speech therapies, lifestyle and dietary changes, or with medications. Managing symptoms will not prevent the disease from progressing but can be important for maintaining quality of life.[12]: 48  It is important to note, however, that many disorders that cause ataxia and related symptoms exist, and that management strategies that work for some, such as vitamin E supplements for certain acquired ataxias, will not work for hereditary ataxias like SCA1 and can be dangerous to a person's health.[12]: 52\nSmall cohort studies have shown that individuals with cerebellar disorders recover coordination and have lower SARA scores regardless of stage or severity of their ataxia before therapy when they are regularly participating in physiotherapy or exergaming over individuals who are not. These studies suggest that multidomain physical therapy, more focused coordinative training, and exergaming routines all produced improvements in SARA scores equivalent to at least one year of normal progression, 2.2 points or more on average, over the course of several weeks. While these results are promising, larger scale studies may be necessary to validate these results.[55] Overall, physical therapy for individuals with ataxia has modest evidence supporting its efficaciousness, but current practice uses custom treatments without a standard decision making procedure between clinics, which limits the ability to reproducibly assess the quality of routines in literature.[56] Among the earliest developed neurorehabilitation practices is Frenkel exercises, which was developed by Heinrich Frenkel in the mid nineteenth century;[57] these exercises were drawn from contemporary physical medicine and rehabilitation techniques, called medical gymnastics, and from everyday activities, like standing up from a chair, to find exercises which are closely related to the pathology of ataxia and rely on slow practice and on the individuals perseverance to relearn key motor skills, replacing lost proprioception with visual feedback. There are exercises for lower limbs, like extending the legs, and upper limbs, like placing pegs in boards, and depending on the severity of the ataxia can be performed laying down, sitting, or standing up. All exercises often start with simple movements and become progressively more difficult to emulate real world movements affected by the disorder.[58]\nCommon recommendations for persons with dysphagia, or swallowing problems, include pureeing food, replacing difficult to eat foods in the diet, or changing posture during eating. When swallowing problems become severe enough that aspiration pneumonias are frequent or dietary changes fail to prevent weight loss, a feeding tube may be considered.[12]: 82–86  Typically these are percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy jejunal tubes (PEG-Js), however these do not necessarily lead to a decreased incidence of aspiration, as clogs may result in gastroesophageal reflux which can be aspirated. Direct PEG-Js seem to cause less frequent reflux and have lower incidence of aspiration pneumonia compared to the standard PEG-J procedure.[59] Numerous strategies for treating dysphagia have been investigated including physical exercises like modified Valsalva maneuvers, pharmaceutical treatments focused on treating spasticity, and compensatory practices including adjusting posture and longer chewing. These strategies, like the treatment of many symptoms hereditary ataxias, have small scale evidence for their usefulness but are not yet established by large studies.[60]\nAs with all hereditary diseases, concerns about the impact on family members, especially children, are often very important. Individuals diagnosed with SCA 1 may seek genetic counseling to aid in family planning, developing coping skills, and planning for the future. Persons with SCA 1 may consider in vitro fertilization with preimplantation testing to prevent passing the disease on to their children.[39]",
    "Prognosis": "Penetrance for SCA1 is 100% for most alleles, so almost all individuals who have at least one copy of the mutated gene will eventually develop symptoms.[51] At least one case has been reported where penetrance may have been incomplete in a woman with 44 glutamine repeats with histidine interruptions whose father had exhibited symptoms, but herself had not shown symptoms at the age of 66.[1][61] Individuals with a low number of repeats, around 39 to 55, typically live past reproductive age and can pass on the disease to their children, while high repeats may express juvenile onset and fatality.[62]",
    "Epidemiology": "The National Institute of Health reports that SCA1 has a prevalence of approximately 1 or 2 per 100,000[63] however a review of literature has shown that these estimates vary significantly from study to study and can be less than 1 per 100,000 or as high as 6 per 100,000.[64] Among all types of SCA, SCA1 is among the most common and the portion accounted for by SCA1 varies between geographic regions, with percentages as high as 40% of all SCA diagnoses in populations in Russia and South Africa being SCA1. In the United States SCA1 accounts for 6% of SCA diagnoses.[65] Overall, SCA1 accounts for 6-27% of all cases dominant ataxias.[38]: 6  Because of its late onset, often appearing after reproductive age, SCA1 exerts low selection intensity, ranking about 0.19 on the Crow's index, but intensity may vary with time within a population or family, as anticipation increases the number of CAG repeats. One implication of this is that SCA1 is unlikely to disappear from a population by natural selection alone.[62]\nPrevalence of each type of SCA varies with geographic region and ethnicity, possibly because of founder effects and historic migration patterns.[66] High prevalence regions include central Poland, where 68% of autosomal dominant cerebellar disorders are SCA1;[67] communities in Tamil Nadu, where up to 7.2% of the population has SCA1 in some small villages;[68] the Tohoku region on the northern portion of Honshu Island, with 24.8% of cases being SCA1;[69] and among Yakut populations in eastern Siberia, with a prevalence 46 per 100,000 in rural populations.[62]"

    "Disease": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6",
    "Signs and symptoms": "SCA6 is typified by progressive and permanent cerebellar dysfunction. These cerebellar signs include ataxia and dysarthria, likely caused by cerebellar atrophy. Prior to diagnosis and the onset of major symptoms, patients often report a feeling of \"wooziness\" and momentary imbalance when turning corners or making rapid movements. The age at which symptoms first occur varies widely, from age 19 to 71, but is typically between 43 and 52. Other major signs of SCA6 are the loss of vibratory and proprioceptive sensation and nystagmus.[1]\nWhile most patients present with these severe progressive symptoms, others, sometimes within the same family, display episodic non-progressive symptoms more similar to episodic ataxia. Still others present with symptoms common to both SCA6 and familial hemiplegic migraine.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "Spinocerebellar Ataxia Diagnosis is done via genetic testing.  Your Neurologist can administer the test.\nSpinocerebellar Ataxia is often misdiagnosed as other diseases such as ALC or Parkinson's Disease.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "There are no drug based treatments currently available for SCA Type 6, however, there are supportive treatments that may be useful in managing symptoms.\nPhysical Therapy, Speech Pathology can help patients manage the symptoms.[citation needed]",
    "Epidemiology": "The prevalence of SCA6 varies by culture. In Germany, SCA6 accounts for 10-25% of all autosomal dominant cases of SCA (SCA itself having a prevalence of 1 in 100,000).[8][9] This prevalence in lower in Japan, however, where SCA6 accounts for only ~6% of spinocerebellar ataxias.[10] In Australia, SCA6 accounts for 30% of spinocerebellar ataxia cases while 11% in the Dutch.[11][12]"

    "Disease": "Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "SSPE is characterized by a history of primary measles infection, followed by a normal, unremarkable recovery.[5] Symptoms of SSPE appear later.[5] On average, the first symptoms appear about 10 years after the initial infection, though this varies significantly, as some people have developed SSPE symptoms as soon as 1 month after infection, and others as long as 27 years later.[5]\nAfter the asymptomatic period, progressive neurological deterioration occurs, characterized by behavior change, intellectual problems, myoclonic seizures, blindness, ataxia, and eventually death.[7][8]\nThe very earliest symptoms are small, subtle changes in behavior, such as not paying attention or struggling with schoolwork.[9]  By the time family members have become concerned, the disease is at Stage 1, and shows nonspecific symptoms of neurological problems, such as being more irritable than usual, more affectionate than usual, lethargic, or having speech difficulties.[9]  Because the symptoms are nonspecific, it this stage it may be obvious to people who know the child well that something is wrong, but unclear what the problem is.\nLater symptoms are not subtle.  They include myoclonic seizures, epileptic seizures, loss of vision, loss of coordination, and difficulty moving.[9]\nThere are multiple staging systems. Symptoms progress through four stages, such as these:[10][11]",
    "Diagnosis": "SSPE may be suspected in any child with symptoms of a progressive (keeps getting worse) neurological disease and who has never been vaccinated against measles.[9]\nTypical diagnostic tests include electroencephalography (EEG) to look for evidence of epilepsy or other disturbances to brain waves and a test of the cerebrospinal fluid to look for elevated levels of antibodies against measles and to rule out multiple sclerosis.[9] Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain usually looks normal early in the disease.[9]",
    "Treatment": "There is no cure.[14] Most treatments are supportive measures, such as anticonvulsants to reduce seizures.[8]\nIf the diagnosis is made early, oral isoprinosine (Inosiplex) is standard,[9] but it is expensive and only stabilizes or improves symptoms for about 30% of people with SSPE.[5] Less effective medications include intraventricular interferon alfa, amantadine, ribavirin, and others.[5] Immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG) is also used.[9]  Isoprinosine is sometimes combined with interferon alfa.[5][9]\nFollowing onset of stage 2, the disease is invariably fatal.",
    "Prognosis": "Almost everyone who develops SSPE dies as a result of SSPE or secondary complications[5].  Commonly, the person dies within a few months to a few years.[5] Faster deterioration in cases of acute fulminant SSPE can lead to death within 3 months of diagnosis.[15][16]  This faster progression may be called measles inclusion body encephalitis.[9]\nAlthough the prognosis is bleak for SSPE past stage 1, there is a 5% spontaneous remission rate. This may take the form of either a full remission of symptoms that may last many years, or an improvement in condition, giving a longer progression period, or else at least a longer period with the less severe symptoms.[16][17]\nIf a remission is achieved, the subsequent relapse is untreatable.[18]",
    "Epidemiology": "The number of people who develop SSPE depends on the number of people who get sick with measles.[5]  For every 100,000 children or adults who get measles, between 4 and 11 of them will develop SSPE.[5]  An outbreak of measles within any community is \"inevitably\" followed by an uptick in SSPE among the people (usually children) who had been infected with measles.[9]\nThe chance of developing SSPE is higher for babies (about 1 in 600 infected babies will later develop SSPE) than for those who had measles when they were older.[5]  Boys develop SSPE about three times as often as girls.[9]\nSSPE is a rare condition, although there is still relatively high incidence in Asia and the Middle East. However, the number of reported cases is declining since the introduction of the measles vaccine. Eradication of the measles virus prevents the SSPE mutation and therefore the progression of the disease, or even the initial infection itself.[19]"

    "Disease": "Subglottic stenosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Symptoms may range from stridor during exercise to complete obstruction of the airway. In idiopathic cases, symptoms may be mistaken for asthma. In congenital cases, symptoms occur soon after birth, and include difficulty breathing, stridor, and air hunger. If the vocal cords are affected, symptoms may include inability to make sound, and an unusual cry.[2]",
    "Causes": "Most commonly, acquired cases are caused by trauma or certain medical procedures. The condition is more often caused by external trauma in adults. External injuries occur from vehicular accidents or clothesline injuries.[2] Iatrogenic cases can occur from intubation, tracheostomy, and an endotracheal tube cuff pressure that is too high.[3] 17 hours of intubation in adults and 1 week of intubation in neonates can cause the injury. Infants born prematurely can be intubated for a longer amount of time due to the fact that they have more flexible cartilage and a larynx located high in the airway. 90% of acquired cases in children are due to intubation, due to the ring of cartilage in the upper airway.[2] Less commonly, infections, such as bacterial tracheitis, tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, diphtheria, and laryngeal papillomatosis can cause it. Systemic diseases, such as amyloidosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, scleroderma, relapsing polychondritis, and polyarthritis, can also cause it. Other causes may include aspiration of foreign bodies, burns, and exposure to occupational hazards.[3] Very rarely, the condition may also have no known cause, in which case it is known as idiopathic subglottic stenosis.[2]",
    "Diagnosis": "CT scans and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) can help in diagnosis. X-rays can determine the location and size of the narrowed airway portion. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) can help observe the progression of the injury. Esophageal pH monitoring can help detect any acid reflux, which can worsen the condition. A laryngoscopy or an endoscope can be inserted and used to see the vocal cords, airway, and esophagus/trachea. Spirometry is a useful way to measure respiratory function. People affected by subglottic stenosis have a FEV1 of over 10.[2]\nSubglottic stenosis is graded according to the Cotton-Myer classification system from one to four based on the severity of the blockage. Grade 1  is up to 50% obstruction, Grade 2 is 50-70% obstruction, Grade 3 is 70-99% obstruction, and Grade 4 is with no visible lumen.[5]",
    "Treatment": "The goal of treatment is to relieve any breathing difficulty and to ensure that the airway remains open in the long term. In mild cases, the disease can be treated with endoscopic balloon dilation. In severe cases, open surgery is done. Owing to the risk of complications, tracheostomy is avoided if possible.[2]\nIn severe cases, the condition frequently recurs after dilation, and the main treatment is open surgery. There are three main surgical procedures that are used when treating subglottic stenosis. These include endoscopy, open neck surgery, and tracheotomy. Endoscopic procedures include dilation via balloon or rigid, incision via laser, and stent placement.[2]\nIn mild cases, such as cases with only granuloma or thin, web-like tissue, dilation is able to remove the lesion. In severe cases, dilation and laser treatment only works temporarily, and the condition frequently recurs. Repeated procedures, especially stents, come with the risk of increasing the damaged area. Also, laser resection has a risk of damaging the cartilage underneath. For this reason, surgery is typically done.[6] In addition to surgery, mitomycin can be applied topically and glucocorticoids can be injected.[2]\nSteroid injections may be used as an initial treatment, or as an on-going maintenance treatment. The treatment involves injecting a steroid through your neck into your airway. The doctor will use local anesthesia to numb the neck, airway and nose. Typically, people who have this treatment have a series of injections every four to six weeks.[7]\nIdiopathic cases are usually treated via endoscopic balloon or laser dilation, and dilation may be improved by injecting corticosteroids. Endoscopic balloon dilation is the safest and main treatment in pregnant women. It allows dilation via noninvasive measures such as expanding a balloon catheter via ventilation.[2]",
    "Prognosis": "The condition frequently recurs after dilation. The prognosis after surgery is good if it is done carefully to avoid complications.[2]",
    "Epidemiology": "The condition has decreased in frequency over time, due to improved management of people on a ventilator. The condition occurs in around 1% of endotracheal tube users.[4] Subglottic stenosis is a rare condition, affecting 1 in every 400,000 people.[7]\nIdiopathic subglottic stenosis is even more rare, approximately 15-19% of all cases of subglottic stenosis are idiopathic and the vast majority of cases are found in women.[8] The exact incidence and prevalence is unknown because people may go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, determining the true frequency of idiopathic subglottic stenosis in the general population is difficult.[9]"

    "Disease": "Superficial siderosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Superficial siderosis is characterized by many symptoms resulting from brain damage:[4]",
    "Causes": "The most commonly described underlying cause of superficial siderosis is chronic bleeding into the subarachnoid space of the brain, which releases erythrocytes, or blood cells, into the cerebrospinal fluid. The chronic bleeding can come from many sources such as from an arteriovenous malformation or cavernous malformation, myxopapillary ependymoma of the spinal cord, from chronic subdural hematoma, from a ventricular shunt, or from chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage. Chronic bleeding sources can also be a result of past brain surgery or CNS trauma, which may be the most common cause of superficial siderosis, with superficial siderosis showing up many years later.[5] In up to as many as half of all described cases the source of bleeding was never found.[5]",
    "Diagnosis": "Early detection of superficial siderosis is usually via MRI. The iron deposition that is characteristic of superficial siderosis shows up as a hypointense band in affected tissues, with a characteristic rim of intensity appearing on the cerebellum; a hyperintense rim is rarely seen.[8] Taking samples of cerebrospinal fluid may also reveal siderosis through xanthochromia, elevated presence of red blood cells, high iron and ferritin concentrations, and elevated levels of the proteins Tau, amyloid beta (Aβ42), neurofilament light chain (NFL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), but the CSF is sometimes normal.[10] Detection is complicated by the fact that superficial siderosis is a rare disease and is not well described in neurological texts, so it may go unnoticed until noticeable symptoms appear.[11]",
    "Treatment": "There is no current cure for superficial siderosis, only treatments to help alleviate the current symptoms and to help prevent the development of further symptoms. If a source of bleeding can be identified (sources are frequently not found), then surgical correction of the bleeding source can be performed; this has proved to be effective in halting the development of further symptoms in some cases and has no effect on symptoms that have already presented.[8] \nPatients with superficial siderosis are often treated with deferiprone (brand name is Ferriprox), a lipid-soluble iron chelator, as this medication has been demonstrated to chelate iron in the central nervous system.[12]  \nDeferiprone use is associated with severe neutropenia, but this risk and associated complications are usually minimised by administering a weekly blood test that measures absolute neutrophil count.[13]\nAlleviation of the most common symptom, hearing loss, has been varyingly successful through the use of cochlear implants. Most people do not notice a large improvement after successful implantation, which is most likely due to damage to the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII) and not the cochlea itself.[14] Some people fare far better, with a return to near-normal hearing, but there is little ability to detect how well a person will respond to this treatment at this time.[15]"

    "Disease": "Superior canal dehiscence syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The superior canal dehiscence can affect both hearing and balance to different extents in different people.[citation needed]\nSymptoms of the SCDS include:",
    "Causes": "According to current research, in approximately 2.5% of the general population the bones of the head develop to only 60–70% of their normal thickness in the months following birth. This genetic predisposition may explain why the section of temporal bone separating the superior semicircular canal from the cranial cavity, normally 0.8 mm thick, shows a thickness of only 0.5 mm, making it more fragile and susceptible to damage through physical head trauma or from slow erosion. An explanation for this erosion of the bone has not yet been found.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "The presence of dehiscence can be detected by a high definition (0.6 mm or less) coronal CT scan of the temporal bone, currently the most reliable way to distinguish between superior canal dehiscence syndrome (SCDS) and other conditions of the inner ear involving similar symptoms such as Ménière's disease, perilymphatic fistula and cochlea-facial nerve dehiscence.[10][11] Other diagnostic tools include the vestibular evoked myogenic potential or VEMP test, videonystagmography (VNG), electrocochleography (ECOG) and the rotational chair test. An accurate diagnosis is of great significance as unnecessary exploratory middle ear surgery may thus be avoided. Several of the symptoms typical to SCDS (e.g. vertigo and Tullio) may also be present singly or as part of Ménière's disease, sometimes causing the one illness to be confused with the other. There are reported cases of patients being affected by both Ménière's disease and SCDS concurrently.[citation needed]\nAs SCDS is a very rare and still a relatively unknown condition, obtaining an accurate diagnosis of this distressing (and even disabling) disease may take some time as many health care professionals are not yet aware of its existence and frequently dismiss symptoms as being mental health-related.[12]",
    "Treatment": "Once diagnosed, the gap in the temporal bone can be repaired by surgical resurfacing of the affected bone or plugging of the superior semicircular canal.[13][unreliable source?][14] These techniques are performed by accessing the site of the dehiscence either via a middle fossa craniotomy or via a canal drilled through the transmastoid bone behind the affected ear. Bone cement has been the material most often used, in spite of its tendency to slippage and resorption, and a consequent high failure rate; recently, soft tissue grafts have been substituted.[15]"

    "Signs and symptoms": "Signs and symptoms include early satiety, nausea, vomiting, extreme \"stabbing\" postprandial abdominal pain (due to both the duodenal compression and the compensatory reversed peristalsis), abdominal distention/distortion, burping, external hypersensitivity or tenderness of the abdominal area, reflux, and heartburn.[5] In infants, feeding difficulties and poor weight gain are also frequent symptoms.[6]\nIn some cases of SMA syndrome, severe malnutrition accompanying spontaneous wasting may occur.[7] This, in turn, increases the duodenal compression, which worsens the underlying cause, creating a cycle of worsening symptoms.[8]\nFear of eating is commonly seen among those with the chronic form of SMA syndrome. For many, symptoms are partially relieved when in the left lateral decubitus or knee-to-chest position, or in the prone (face down) position. A Hayes maneuver, which corresponds to applying pressure below the umbilicus in cephalad and dorsal direction, elevates the root of the SMA, also slightly easing the constriction. Symptoms can be aggravated when leaning to the right or taking a face up position.[7]",
    "Causes": "Retroperitoneal fat and lymphatic tissue normally serve as a cushion for the duodenum, protecting it from compression by the SMA. SMA syndrome is thus triggered by any condition involving an insubstantial cushion and narrow mesenteric angle. SMA syndrome can present in two forms: chronic/congenital or acute/induced.[citation needed]\nPatients with the chronic, congenital form of SMA syndrome predominantly have a lengthy or even lifelong history of abdominal complaints with intermittent exacerbations depending on the degree of duodenal compression. Risk factors include anatomic characteristics such as: asthenic (very thin or \"lanky\") body build, an unusually high insertion of the duodenum at the ligament of Treitz, a particularly low origin of the SMA, or intestinal malrotation around an axis formed by the SMA.[9]  Predisposition is easily aggravated by any of the following: poor motility of the digestive tract,[3] retroperitional tumors, loss of appetite, malabsorption, cachexia, exaggerated lumbar lordosis, visceroptosis, abdominal wall laxity, peritoneal adhesions, abdominal trauma,[10] rapid linear adolescent growth spurt, weight loss, starvation, catabolic states (as with cancer and burns), and history of neurological injury.[11]\nThe acute form of SMA syndrome develops rapidly after traumatic incidents that forcibly hyper-extend the SMA across the duodenum, inducing the obstruction, or sudden weight loss for any reason. Causes include prolonged supine bed rest, scoliosis surgery, left nephrectomy, ileo-anal pouch surgery.[citation needed]\nSMA syndrome is usually difficult to differentiate with anorexia nervosa.[12] Patients with SMA syndrome can be hindered restoring weight in those with anorexia nervosa.[13]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is very difficult, and usually one of exclusion. SMA syndrome is thus considered only after patients have undergone an extensive evaluation of their gastrointestinal tract including upper endoscopy, and evaluation for various malabsorptive, ulcerative and inflammatory intestinal conditions with a higher diagnostic frequency. Diagnosis may follow X-ray examination revealing duodenal dilation followed by abrupt constriction proximal to the overlying SMA, as well as a delay in transit of four to six hours through the gastroduodenal region.  Standard diagnostic exams include abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan with oral and IV contrast, upper gastrointestinal series (UGI), and, for equivocal cases, hypotonic duodenography.  In addition, vascular imaging studies such as ultrasound and contrast angiography may be used to indicate increased bloodflow velocity through the SMA or a narrowed SMA angle.[14][15]\nDespite multiple case reports, there has been controversy surrounding the diagnosis and even the existence of SMA syndrome since symptoms do not always correlate well with radiologic findings, and may not always improve following surgical correction.[16] However, the reason for the persistence of gastrointestinal symptoms even after surgical correction in some cases has been traced to the remaining prominence of reversed peristalsis in contrast to direct peristalsis.[17]\nSince females between the ages of 10 and 30 are most frequently affected, it is not uncommon for physicians to initially and incorrectly assume that emaciation is a choice of the patient instead of a consequence of SMA syndrome.  Patients in the earlier stages of SMA syndrome often remain unaware that they are ill until substantial damage to their health is done, since they may attempt to adapt to the condition by gradually decreasing their food intake or naturally gravitating toward a lighter and more digestible diet.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "SMA syndrome can present in acute, acquired form (e.g., abruptly emerging within an inpatient stay following scoliosis surgery) as well as chronic form (i.e., developing throughout the course of a lifetime and advancing due to environmental triggers, life changes, or other illnesses). According to a number of recent sources, at least 70% of cases can typically be treated with medical treatment, while the rest require surgical treatment.[5][11][19]\nMedical treatment is attempted first in many cases. In some cases, emergency surgery is necessary upon presentation.[11] A six-week trial of medical treatment is recommended in pediatric cases.[5] The goal of medical treatment for SMA syndrome is the resolution of underlying conditions and weight gain. Medical treatment may involve nasogastric tube placement for duodenal and gastric decompression, mobilization into the prone or left lateral decubitus position,[20] the reversal or removal of the precipitating factor with proper nutrition and replacement of fluid and electrolytes, either by surgically inserted jejunal feeding tube, nasogastric intubation, or peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC line) administering total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Pro-motility agents such as metoclopramide may also be beneficial.[21]  Symptoms may improve after restoration of weight, except when reversed peristalsis persists, or if regained fat refuses to accumulate within the mesenteric angle.[17] Most patients seem to benefit from nutritional support with hyperalimentation irrespective of disease history.[22]\nIf medical treatment fails, or is not feasible due to severe illness, surgical intervention is required. The most common operation for SMA syndrome, duodenojejunostomy, was first proposed in 1907 by Bloodgood.[7] Performed as either an  open surgery or laparoscopically, duodenojejunostomy involves the creation of an anastomosis between the duodenum and the jejunum,[23] bypassing the compression caused by the AA and the SMA.[1]  Less common surgical treatments for SMA syndrome include Roux-en-Y duodenojejunostomy, gastrojejunostomy, anterior transposition of the third portion of the duodenum, intestinal derotation, division of the ligament of Treitz (Strong's operation), and transposition of the SMA.[24] Both transposition of the SMA and lysis of the duodenal suspensory muscle have the advantage that they do not involve the creation of an intestinal anastomosis.[9]\nThe possible persistence of symptoms after surgical bypass can be traced to the remaining prominence of reversed peristalsis in contrast to direct peristalsis. However, the precipitating factor (the duodenal compression) has been bypassed or relieved. Reversed peristalsis has been shown to respond to duodenal circular drainage, a complex and invasive open surgical procedure originally implemented and performed in China.[17]\nIn some cases, SMA syndrome may occur alongside a serious, life-threatening condition such as cancer or AIDS. Even in these cases, though, treatment of the SMA syndrome can lead to a reduction in symptoms and an increased quality of life.[25][26]",
    "Prognosis": "Delay in the diagnosis of SMA syndrome can result in fatal catabolysis (advanced malnutrition), dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, hypokalemia, acute gastric rupture or intestinal perforation (from prolonged mesenteric ischemia), gastric distention, spontaneous upper gastrointestinal bleeding, hypovolemic shock, and aspiration pneumonia.[1][14][27]\nA small number of sources have quoted a roughly 33% mortality rate for superior mesenteric artery syndrome.[28] Despite extensive research, no source data has been found to support this mortality rate, suggesting it is likely unreliable. While research establishing an official mortality rate may not exist, two studies of SMA syndrome patients, one published in 2006 looking at 22 cases[11] and another in 2012 looking at 80 cases,[19] noted mortality rates of 0%[11] and 6.3%,[19] respectively. According to the authors in one of these studies, the expected outcome for SMA syndrome treatment is generally considered excellent.[11]",
    "Epidemiology": "According to a 1956 study, only 0.3% of patients referred for an upper-gastrointestinal-tract barium studies fit this diagnosis, and is thus a rare disease.[29] Recognition of SMA syndrome as a distinct clinical entity is controversial, due in part to its possible confusion with a number of other conditions,[30] though it is now widely acknowledged.[1] However, unfamiliarity with this condition in the medical community coupled with its intermittent and nonspecific symptomatology probably results in its underdiagnosis.[26]\nAs the syndrome involves a lack of essential fat, more than half of those diagnosed are underweight, sometimes to the point of sickliness and emaciation.  Females are impacted more often than males, and while the syndrome can occur at any age, it is most frequently diagnosed in early adulthood.  The most common co-morbid conditions include mental and behavioral disorders including eating disorders and depression, infectious diseases including tuberculosis and acute gastroenteritis, and nervous system diseases including muscular dystrophy, Parkinson's disease, and cerebral palsy.[19]",
    "Society and culture": "American actor, director, producer, and writer Christopher Reeve had the acute form of SMA syndrome as a result of spinal cord injury.[citation needed] Former model Lisa Brown died in 2017 due to her SMAS after her insurance denied the potentially life saving surgery she needed. Her initial surgery failed causing her to require an intestinal transplant that was expected to cost up to $1 million leading her insurance to deny it. She planned her own funeral.[32][33]\nIn 2017 the only US non-profit began distributing grants to those with SMAS. They are registered to the IRS under the name Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome Research, Awareness and Support, but also work under the DBA of SMAS Patient Assistance. They offer several resources on their website smasyndrome.com and their Facebook business page. SMAS Patient assistance works to disprove inaccurate information, educate on better diagnostic testing, and more successful surgeries such as Duodenal Deroation with LADDS.[34]"

    "Disease": "Synovial chondromatosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "People usually complain of pain in one joint, which persists for months, or even years, does not ease with exercise, steroid injection or heat treatment, shows nothing on X-ray, but shows a definite restriction of movement.\nThere are 3 defined stages to this disease:\nIn the early stages of the disease it is often confused with tendinosis and/or arthritis. Once it reaches transitional the loose bodies become apparent with X-ray in greater than 70% of cases, with MRI often showing where xray fails. In experienced hands, ultrasound is also useful for the diagnosis.[2]\nRare and little known, with currently no known cure, the disease gradually forms blisters in the thin flexible membrane of the synovium, which calcify and enlarge. These nodules eventually break free and float around the joint space becoming larger – these add to the discomfort and stiffness of the joint. The affected tissue will show up as a semi-solid mass in an MRI scan, final diagnosis is usually confirmed by taking a biopsy. The disease generally affects only one of the larger weight bearing joints (hip, ankle, knee) – although the elbow, and wrist can also be affected. It rarely involves the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and most publications are case reports.[3]\nSynovial chondromatosis occurs twice as commonly in males as females and usually in their forties. However, online communities for synovial chondromatosis patients have yielded a stark contrast, with equal representation from both genders and members diagnosed as young as late teenage/early 20s. Familial synovial chondromatosis with dwarfism introduces characteristics of dwarfism.",
    "Causes": "The exact underlying cause of synovial chondromatosis is unknown. Some evidence suggests trauma may play a role in its development as it mainly presents in weight-bearing joints. Infection has also been considered as a contributing factor. The condition is not inherited.[4]\nSynovial chondromatosis can reportedly occur as either a primary or secondary form. Primary synovial chondromatosis, which is more rare, occurs spontaneously and does not appear to relate to any pre-existing conditions. Secondary synovial chondromatosis is the more common form and often occurs when there is pre-existent osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteonecrosis, osteochondritis dissecans, neuropathic osteoarthropathy (which often occurs in diabetic individuals), tuberculosis, or osteochondral fractures (torn cartilage covering the end of a bone in a joint) in the affected individual.[4]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is by medical imaging; X-ray, CT scan and MRI.[1]\nFor diagnosis of the TMJ, Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) can also be useful.[6]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment is frequently by means of removal of the loose bodies and of a partial or full synovectomy (removal of the synovium)\nFull synovectomy is a moderately major operation and involves completely exposing the joint and removing the affected tissue. Partial synovectomy is normally done arthroscopically. Synovectomies are normally carried out by shaving the lining of the knee but there are other ways of achieving this by either freezing the synovium or by the use of radiation treatment.\nThe need for further procedures is greater than 25% although normally the frequency of the required removal of loose bodies is reduced by the previous synovectomy. There have been documented cases of malignant transformation however this is rare.\nWhilst the condition can be described as a ‘benign growth’ it seldom affects more than one joint, and does not usually affect surrounding tissue."

    "Disease": "Syringomyelia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Syringomyelia causes a wide variety of neuropathic symptoms, due to damage to the spinal cord. Patients may experience severe chronic pain, abnormal sensations and loss of sensation, particularly in the hands. Some patients experience paralysis or paresis, temporarily or permanently. A syrinx may also cause disruptions in the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems, leading to Horner syndrome, abnormal body temperature or sweating, bowel control issues, or other problems. If the syrinx is higher up in the spinal cord or affecting the brainstem, as in syringobulbia, vocal cord paralysis, ipsilateral tongue wasting, trigeminal nerve sensory loss, and other signs may be present.[6] Rarely, bladder stones can occur at the onset of weakness in the lower extremities.[7]\nClassically, syringomyelia spares the dorsal column/medial lemniscus of the spinal cord, leaving pressure, vibration, touch and proprioception intact in the upper extremities. Neuropathic arthropathy, also known as a Charcot joint, can occur, particularly in the shoulders, in patients with syringomyelia.[8] The loss of sensory fibers to the joint is theorized to lead to degeneration of the joint over time.[9]",
    "Causes": "Generally, there are two forms of syringomyelia: congenital and acquired. Syringomyelia is generally a chronic disorder that occurs over time, resulting in muscular atrophy. Acquired Syringomyelia can be caused by a serious physical trauma to the body such as in a road traffic accident. Syringomyelia can also be classified into communicating and noncommunicating forms. Communicating typically occurs due to lesions on the foramen magnum and noncommunicating occurring due to other spinal cord diseases.[10]\nThe first major form relates to an abnormality of the brain called an Arnold–Chiari malformation or Chiari malformation. This is the most common cause of syringomyelia, where the anatomic abnormality, which may be due to a small posterior fossa, causes the lower part of the cerebellum to protrude from its normal location in the back of the head into the cervical or neck portion of the spinal canal. A syrinx may then develop in the cervical region of the spinal cord. Here, symptoms usually begin between the ages of 25 and 40 and may worsen with straining, called a valsalva maneuver, or any activity that causes cerebrospinal fluid pressure to fluctuate suddenly. Some patients, however, may have long periods of stability. Some patients with this form of the disorder also have hydrocephalus, in which cerebrospinal fluid accumulates in the skull, or a condition called arachnoiditis, in which a covering of the spinal cord—the arachnoid membrane—is inflamed.[11]  Some cases of syringomyelia are familial, although this is rare.[12]\nThe second major form of syringomyelia occurs as a complication of trauma, meningitis, hemorrhage, a tumor, or arachnoiditis. Here, the syrinx or cyst develops in a segment of the spinal cord damaged by one of these conditions. The syrinx then starts to expand. This is sometimes referred to as noncommunicating syringomyelia. Symptoms may appear months or even years after the initial injury, starting with pain, weakness, and sensory impairment originating at the site of trauma.[13]\nThe primary symptom of post-traumatic syringomyelia (often referred to using the abbreviation of PTS)[14] is pain, which may spread upward from the site of injury. Symptoms, such as pain, numbness, weakness, and disruption in temperature sensation, may be limited to one side of the body. Syringomyelia can also adversely affect sweating, sexual function, and, later, bladder and bowel control. A typical cause of PTS would be a car accident or similar trauma involving a whiplash injury.[citation needed]\nWhat can make PTS difficult to diagnose is the fact that symptoms can often first appear long after the actual cause of the syrinx occurred (e.g., a car accident occurring and then the patient first experiencing PTS symptoms such as pain, loss of sensation, and reduced ability on the skin to feel varying degrees of hot and cold a number of months after the car accident).[15]",
    "Diagnosis": "Physicians now use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose syringomyelia. The MRI radiographer takes images of body anatomy, such as the brain and spinal cord, in vivid detail. This test will show the syrinx in the spine or any other conditions, such as the presence of a tumor. MRI is safe, painless, and informative and has greatly improved the diagnosis of syringomyelia.[18]\nThe physician may order additional tests to help confirm the diagnosis. One of these is called electromyography (EMG), which show possible lower motor neuron damage.[19] Note this test isn't used diagnostically for injuries to the spine but to nerves and muscles. This would be part of a patient's rehab routine. In addition, computed axial tomography (CT) scans of a patient's head may reveal the presence of tumors and other abnormalities such as hydrocephalus.[20]\nLike MRI and CT scans, another test, called a myelogram, uses radiographs and requires a contrast medium to be injected into the subarachnoid space. Since the introduction of MRI, this test is rarely necessary to diagnose syringomyelia.[21]\nThe possible causes are trauma, tumors, and congenital defects. It is most usually observed in the part of the spinal cord corresponding to the neck area. Symptoms are due to spinal cord damage and include pain, decreased sensation of touch, weakness, and loss of muscle tissue. The diagnosis is confirmed with a spinal CT, myelogram or MRI of the spinal cord. The cavity may be reduced by surgical decompression.[22]\nFurthermore, evidence also suggests that impact injuries to the thorax area highly correlate with the occurrence of a cervical-located syrinx.[23]",
    "Treatment": "Treating syringomyelia sometimes requires surgery. Surgery involving the spinal cord carries certain risks, and as with any medical treatment, the potential benefits have to be weighed against the possible complications. On the other hand, delaying treatment can increase the risk of permanent damage. Evaluation of the condition is necessary because syringomyelia can remain stationary for long periods of time, and in some cases progress rapidly.[24]\nThe main goal of surgical intervention is to correct the condition which led to the formation of the syrinx. Draining the syrinx can also help, by preventing it from becoming worse, but the symptoms the syrinx has already caused may not go away.[citation needed]\nIn cases involving an Arnold–Chiari malformation, the main goal of surgery is to provide more space for the cerebellum at the base of the skull and upper cervical spine, without entering the brain or spinal cord. This often causes the syrinx to shrink or disappear over time, as the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid is restored. If syringomyelia is caused by a tumor, removing the tumor – if possible – is the treatment of choice.[25]\nMost patients' symptoms stabilize or have a modest improvement following surgery. Syringomyelia can come back, however, requiring additional surgeries which may be less effective.[26]\nIn some cases, including both communicating and non-communicating forms of the condition, a syrinx may require ongoing drainage. This is done with a shunt, which uses tubes and valves to let cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drain from the syrinx into another cavity within the body (usually the abdomen). This type of shunt, called a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, is particularly useful in cases involving hydrocephalus. By continually draining the syrinx, a shunt can arrest the progression of symptoms and relieve pain, headache, and tightness.[27]\nMany factors affect the decision to use a shunt. There are risks of injury to the spinal cord, infection, drainage becoming blocked, and bleeding, and they do not always achieve the intended results. Draining the fluid more quickly does not produce better outcomes, but for some syrinxes, a shunt is the only drainage option.[28]\nIn the case of trauma-related syringomyelia, the surgeon operates at the level of the initial injury. The syrinx collapses at surgery, but a tube or shunt is usually necessary to prevent it from returning.[29]\nSurgery is not always recommended for syringomyelia patients. While there is no medication which can cure the condition, for many patients, the main treatment is analgesia to manage the symptoms. Physicians specializing in pain management can develop a medication and treatment plan to ameliorate pain. Medications to combat any neuropathic pain symptoms such as shooting and stabbing pains (e.g. gabapentin or pregabalin) would be first-line choices. Opiates are usually prescribed for pain for management of this condition. Conversely, facet joint injections are not indicated for the treatment of syringomyelia.[30]\nRadiation is rare, but may be used if a tumor is involved. In these cases, it can halt the extension of a cavity and may help to alleviate pain.[31]\nTreatment is usually reserved for cases which are causing symptoms. Treatment may not provide enough benefits to be recommended for elderly patients, or when symptoms are stable instead of worsening. Whether treated or not, many patients are advised to avoid activities that involve straining.[15]\nA conservative approach may be recommended, as the natural history of syringomyelia is not yet well understood. When surgery is not currently advised, patients are monitored with regular physical evaluations and MRI's.[32]"

    "Disease": "Systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Children with sJIA are frequently severely unwell when diagnosed. They often have lost weight and are tired, feverish, experiencing myalgia and arthralgia, as well as occasional chest and stomach pain. These characteristics may overshadow the arthritis in the early stages of the disease.[6]\nThe presence of fever at presentation is practically universal in those with sJIA.[7] The distinctive fever pattern associated with sJIA is characterized by temperatures that surge above 39 °C once or twice a day and then quickly fall to normal or below baseline.[8]\nMore than 80% of patients have a salmon-colored macular or maculopapular rash that appears along with their fever. Urticarial rash is less prevalent. The eruption is usually limited to the trunk, neck, and proximal extremities, but it might spread more widely. Macules typically measure less than 5 mm in diameter, while bigger macules may be present with center fading.[9] The degree of erythema varies in the same patient, however, it is usually migratory and nonpruritic.[10]\nThe existence of arthritis must be validated before meeting the diagnostic criteria. Although arthralgias are often present at onset, arthritis may not be visible at first and can develop weeks, months, or even years later.[9] Additionally, there is a wide range of joint involvement, from polyarticular patterns to oligoarticular patterns (four or fewer joints with arthritis). The wrists, knees, and ankles are the joints that are most frequently affected.[7] Any joint, including the temporomandibular joints,[11] cervical spine,[12] hips,[13] and tiny joints of the hands and feet, may be impacted. Myalgia and tenosynovitis are two other typical musculoskeletal symptoms.[9]\nSJIA is characterized by splenic and lymph node enlargements, which can happen separately or simultaneously. Particularly prevalent locations for prominent symmetrical lymphadenopathy are the anterior cervical, axillary, and inguinal regions. The enlarged lymph nodes are usually firm, movable, and nontender. Splenomegaly, which affects less than 10% of individuals, typically manifests within the first few years of onset and can be severe.[6]\nPericardial involvement frequently occurs. In one study, 81% of children with active systemic symptoms had abnormal echocardiographic findings, and 36% of patients had an effusion or pericardial thickening. The majority of pericardial effusions don't cause any symptoms; they can only be identified by echocardiography and don't show any overt cardiomegaly or usual ECG abnormalities. The characteristic sign of acute pericarditis is chest pain, especially when laying supine and with or without dyspnea.[6]\nThe most frequent respiratory symptom, pleural effusions, can be associated with pericarditis. They are typically asymptomatic and only discovered by chance on chest radiography.[6]\nRoughly one-third of kids with sJIA have occult macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), a potentially fatal illness. MAS is a condition that causes T cells and macrophages to rapidly multiply and get activated, resulting in a \"cytokine storm.\" \"Nonclassic features\" in children with MAS can include a persistent fever instead of a sporadic one, a fixed rash, or both.[14] In addition, myocarditis, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, bleeding due to coagulopathy, and involvement of the central nervous system or respiratory system may be present, depending on the degree of MAS.[15] Significant mortality and cardiopulmonary arrest are linked to MAS.[14]",
    "Causes": "It is mainly unknown what causes sJIA. There have been reports of seasonal fluctuations in the incidence of sJIA in some places but not in others. Although it has frequently been claimed that infectious organisms cause the condition to manifest, microbiologic and virologic analyses are unable to pinpoint a single agent as the cause. Since a negative septic screen is required for the diagnosis, sJIA is not an infectious disease by definition. There is evidence that suggests a genetic predisposition plays a role in the etiology of sJIA.[16]",
    "Diagnosis": "SJIA is diagnosed clinically and corroborated by typical test findings; it is a diagnosis of exclusion.[6] Other causes of fever, such as infections, cancer, and other inflammatory/rheumatologic disorders such autoinflamatory syndromes, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Kawasaki disease, must be ruled out. When a child is suspected of having sJIA, they should always have a full evaluation for infection and cancer. This evaluation should include blood and urine cultures, imaging tests, and perhaps a bone marrow exam or lymph node biopsy to rule out leukemia or lymphoma.[14]\nAccording to the most recent International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) criteria, a child must have arthritis, ≥2 weeks of daily fever that is documented as occurring daily for ≥3 days, and any one of the following symptoms to be classified as having sJIA: organomegaly, lymphadenopathy, serositis, or non-fixed/evanescent rash[29]\nWhile there are typical patterns of laboratory abnormalities, such as elevated C-reactive protein levels, high erythrocyte sedimentation rates, neutrophilia, thrombocytosis, and microcytic anemia, there are no particular laboratory tests for sJIA.[16]",
    "Treatment": "Since the presentation and course of disease differ greatly from patient to patient, treatment must take into account the degree of involvement, the existence of systemic versus arthritic characteristics, and the presence or absence of MAS. Often, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications can be administered safely to offer analgesic and antipyretic effects without changing the results of the first diagnostic assessment.[14]\nClinical trials have shown that anti-interleukin-6 drugs, such as tocilizumab,[30] and anti-interleukin-1 medications, such as anakinra,[31] canakinumab,[32] or rilonacept,[33] are highly successful in managing the disease's systemic symptoms.[14]",
    "Epidemiology": "According to estimates, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) affects 1 to 4 out of every 1000 children, making it the most prevalent rheumatic illness in children.[34][35] With incidence rates ranging from 0.4 to 0.8 children per 100,000 children, sJIA accounts for 10% to 20% of JIA cases.[36]\nThe peak age of presentation is between 1 and 5 years of age. However, children might have symptoms throughout childhood and adolescence. In contrast to other JIA subtypes, children of both genders are equally afflicted.[7] Children from all ethnic origins develop sJIA.[29] Japan and India have reported a somewhat higher prevalence rate than the US or Canada.[37][38]"

    "Disease": "Tarlov cyst",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Walls of Tarlov cysts are thin and fibrous; they are prone to rupture if touched, making surgery difficult. The nerve fibers embedded in the walls of the cysts have the appearance and size of dental floss; these nerve fibers are usually not arranged in any specific alignment.[18] Histologic examination reveals the Tarlov-cyst outer wall is composed of vascular connective tissue, and the inner wall is lined with flattened arachnoid tissue. In addition, part of the lining containing nerve fibers also occasionally contains ganglion cells.[19] The cysts can contain anywhere from a couple of milliliters of CSF to over 2.5 litres (0.5 imp gal; 0.7 US gal) of CSF.[18][20][21]\nTarlov cysts are most commonly located in the S1 to S4/S5 region of the spinal canal, but can be found along any region of the spine. Tarlov cysts typically form on the extradural portions of the sacral nerve roots, most often near the dorsal root ganglion of the dorsal (sensory) nerve roots. They arise within the perineural space, between the endoneurium and perineurium. Occasionally, these cysts are observed in the lumbar and thoracic spine.[19] The cysts are often multiple, extending around the circumference of the nerve, and can enlarge over time to compress neighboring nerve roots, to cause bone erosion.[22]\nThe cysts may also form on the anterior (front) side of the sacrum and have been known to extend into the pelvic cavity. These cysts, though rare, can be found to grow large - over 3–4 centimetres (1.2–1.6 in) in size, often causing severe pelvic pain from compression on the cyst itself as well as adjoining nerves.[citation needed]\nAlthough Tarlov Cysts can develop anywhere along the spine, they are most commonly symptomatic in the sacrum. Women are more likely to exhibit symptoms.[1] They can also appear in clusters or bilaterally along the spine, thus symptoms can be unilateral, bilateral, or with symptoms more dominant on one side. The cases of reported symptomatic Tarlov cysts ranges from 15% to 30% of the overall reported Tarlov cyst cases, depending on the source of literature. Nevertheless, these cysts are important clinical entities because of their tendency to increase in size over time, potentially causing complications and eroding the surrounding bone tissue.[23][22][24]\nBelow is a list of commonly reported symptoms associated with sacral Tarlov cysts. [1]",
    "Causes": "There are several hypotheses proposed regarding the formation of Tarlov cysts, including: hemorrhagic infiltration of spinal tissue, inflammation within the nerve root cysts followed by inoculation of fluids, developmental or congenital origin, arachnoidal proliferation along and around the exiting sacral nerve root, and breakage of venous drainage in the perineuria and epineurium secondary to hemosiderin deposition after trauma.[25]\nTarlov himself theorized that the perineural cysts form as a result of blockage of venous drainage in the perineurium and epineurium secondary to hemosiderin deposition, after local trauma.[22][26]\nAnother theory gaining increasing popularity, over the past decade, is one postulated by Fortuna et al.; it described perineural cysts to be the results of congenital arachnoidal proliferation along the exiting sacral nerve roots.[20] Some research on the migration of inflammatory cell into spinal has been studied. Additionally, in vivo and in vitro studies show inflammation induced by CNS injury causes distinct cystic cavitations created by astrocyte migration.[27]\nMany authors state that blood and its breakdown products acting as foreign-body substance in the subarachnoid space produce local adhesive arachnoiditis with no symptoms, but it also can create cystic degeneration. The subarachnoid space abhors all foreign body substances. Even the presence of injected air is considered to be a  \"foreign body\". Blood definitely is considered a  foreign body, particularly in its breakdown products. Repeated exposure to foreign body substances in the subarachnoid space or spinal injury can initiate auto-immune amnestic reactions which may potentiate and magnify the ongoing inflammatory process causing cystic cavitation in spinal tissue.[citation needed]\nTarlov cysts are known to have the tendency to enlarge over time. The prominent theory that explains this phenomenon reasons the enlargement of the cysts is due to the cerebrospinal fluid being pushed into the cyst during systole pulsation, but unable to get out during the diastole phase, resulting in enlargement observed in clinical settings over time. Increased ICP from trauma or other injury, childbirth, and overexertion are thought to trigger enlargement along with inflammation and hemorrhagic infiltration. With the cysts often containing a valve like mechanism fluid becomes trapped, and the meningeal sac or nerve sheath grows in size. Some patients have been diagnosed for up to 20 years with little change in size, and those with small stable cysts may avoid much progression of symptoms. Those with generally larger sacral cysts pressed along the sacrum cause the sacrum to become eroded and thin.[citation needed]\nWhen Tarlov cysts are ruptured or drained they cause leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Ruptures of Tarlov cysts have been reported associated with communicating aneurysms and from fracture in the proximity of the cysts.[28] An undetected rupture can cause intracranial hypotension, including orthostatic neurological symptoms along with headache, nausea, and vomiting that improve when supine. The ruptured cysts can be patched either with a biosynthetic dural patch or using a blood patch to stem the flow of CSF.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "MRI, or Magnetic Resonance Imaging, is considered the imaging study of choice in identifying Tarlov cysts. MRI provides better resolution of tissue density, absence of bone interference, multiplanar capabilities, and is noninvasive. Plain films may show bony erosion of the spinal canal or of the sacral foramina.[citation needed]\nOn MRI pictures, the signal is the same as the CSF one.\nIf MRI made with a contrast medium:[citation needed]\nA computed tomography (CT) scan is another examination method often used for the diagnosis of Tarlov cyst. Unenhanced CT scans may show sacral erosion, asymmetric epidural fat distribution, and cystic masses that have the same density with CSF.[19]  CT Myelogram is minimally invasive,[31]  and could be employed when MRI cannot be performed on patient.\nA  highly targeted Diagnostic Nerve Root Block (DNRB) using local anesthetic (eg, 1 cc of 0.25% bupivacaine) can be used as a diagnostic test to determine if a Tarlov cyst is symptomatic.[32][33][34]\nDespite increasing clinical documentation, symptomatic Tarlov cysts remain frequently underdiagnosed.[32] This has been attributed to persistent misconceptions in clinical practice and the common perception that these cysts represent incidental findings.[3] Radiologists often omit documenting them on MRI reports or describe them as clinically insignificant, which may contribute to delayed or missed diagnoses.[35] Smaller cysts, in particular, are more likely to be overlooked.[36]\nTarlov cysts are considered Type II lesions, being defined as extradural meningeal cysts with nerve fibers.[37]\nNabors et al. classify Arachnoïd cysts into three types:",
    "Treatment": "Because of the unclear pathogenesis and pathophysiology of Tarlov cysts, there is no consensus on the optimal treatment of symptomatic sacral perineural cysts. Patients often choose to pursue treatment when the progression of neurological deficits seriously impacts their quality of life.\nSince cysts are innervated, micro fenestration and surgical sleeving of the cysts to diminish the amount of accumulated cerebrospinal fluid and decrease compression of the spine and spinal nerves has been successful in a number of patients. The cysts are carefully separated enough from surrounding tissue to be wrapped with fatty tissue or pericardial biomaterial to excise the fluid from the cyst. If the cyst does not drain spontaneously, then it is drained and patched using a biosynthetic dural patch.\nThe use of this technique is done in the U.S. and is spreading in Europe but recovery is generally extensive. Micro fenestration alone has been done with some success in Asia.\nA biopolymer plate is also being used experimentally to strengthen a sacrum thinned by cystic erosion.\nThe risks of CSF leakage are higher on patients that have bilateral cysts on the same spinal level or clusters of cysts along multiple vertebrae, but immediate recognition of the leakage and repair can mitigate that risk.[citation needed]\nVarious treatment methods have been tried in the past, including the extraction of cerebrospinal fluids from the cyst, fibrin glue injection and the complete or partial removal of cyst. Epidurals can provide temporary relief but are not generally recommended as they can cause cysts to enlarge. Extraction of fluid can provide limited or no relief depending on rate the cysts refill and the need to repeat the procedure. Removal of the cyst results in irreversible damage to the intersecting spinal nerve.\nAlthough fibrin-glue therapy initially had been thought to be a promising therapy in the treatment of these cysts, there have been multiple problems associated with the fibrin glue therapy including seepage of fibrin. It is no longer [when?] recommended for use at present by the Health Department in some countries and neurosurgeons previously performing the procedures. \nNevertheless, all types of surgical treatment pose common risks, including neurological deficits, infection and inflammation, spinal headache, urinary disturbances, and leakage of cerebrospinal fluids.[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "Tay%E2%80%93Sachs disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Tay–Sachs disease is typically first noticed in infants around 6 months old displaying an abnormally strong response to sudden noises or other stimuli, known as the \"startle response\". There may also be listlessness or muscle stiffness (hypertonia). The disease is classified into several forms, which are differentiated based on the onset age of neurological symptoms.[8][9]\nInfants with Tay–Sachs disease appear to develop normally for the first six months after birth.[citation needed] Then, as neurons become distended with GM2 gangliosides, a relentless deterioration of mental and physical abilities begins. The child may become blind, deaf, unable to swallow, atrophied, and paralytic. Death usually occurs before the age of four.[8]\nJuvenile Tay–Sachs disease is rarer than other forms of Tay–Sachs and usually is initially seen in children between two and ten years old. People with Tay–Sachs disease experience cognitive and motor skill deterioration, dysarthria, dysphagia, ataxia, and spasticity.[10] Death usually occurs between the ages of five and fifteen years.[4]\nA rare form of this disease, known as Adult-Onset or Late-Onset Tay–Sachs disease, usually has its first symptoms during the 30s or 40s. In contrast to the other forms, late-onset Tay–Sachs disease is usually not fatal as the effects can stop progressing. It is frequently misdiagnosed. It is characterized by unsteadiness of gait and progressive neurological deterioration. Symptoms of late-onset Tay–Sachs – which typically begin to be seen in adolescence or early adulthood – include speech and swallowing difficulties, unsteadiness of gait, spasticity, cognitive decline, and psychiatric illness, particularly a schizophrenia-like psychosis.[11] Late-onset Tay–Sachs patients may become fully wheelchair-bound.[12]\nUntil the 1970s and 1980s, when the disease's molecular genetics became known, the juvenile and adult forms of the disease were not always recognized as variants of Tay–Sachs disease. Post-infantile Tay–Sachs was often misdiagnosed as another neurological disorder, such as Friedreich's ataxia.[13]",
    "Diagnosis": "In patients with a clinical suspicion of Tay–Sachs disease, with any age of onset, the initial testing involves an enzyme assay to measure the activity of hexosaminidase in serum, fibroblasts, or leukocytes. Total hexosaminidase enzyme activity is decreased in individuals with Tay–Sachs as is the percentage of hexosaminidase A. After confirmation of decreased enzyme activity in an individual, confirmation by molecular analysis can be pursued.[28] All patients with infantile-onset Tay–Sachs disease have a \"cherry red\" macula in the retina, easily observable by a physician using an ophthalmoscope.[8][29] This red spot is a retinal area that appears red because of gangliosides in the surrounding retinal ganglion cells. The choroidal circulation is showing through \"red\" in this foveal region where all retinal ganglion cells are pushed aside to increase visual acuity. Thus, this cherry-red spot is the only normal part of the retina; it shows up in contrast to the rest of the retina. Microscopic analysis of the retinal neurons shows they are distended from excess ganglioside storage.[30] Unlike other lysosomal storage diseases (e.g., Gaucher disease, Niemann–Pick disease, and Sandhoff disease), hepatosplenomegaly (liver and spleen enlargement) is not seen in Tay–Sachs.[31]",
    "Treatment": "As of 2010, no treatment addressed the cause of Tay–Sachs disease or could slow its progression; people receive supportive care to ease the symptoms and extend life by reducing the chance of contracting infections.[37] Infants are given feeding tubes when they can no longer swallow.[38] In late-onset Tay–Sachs, medication (e.g., lithium for depression) can sometimes control psychiatric symptoms and seizures, although some medications (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, phenothiazines, haloperidol, and risperidone) are associated with significant adverse effects.[25][39]",
    "Prognosis": "As of 2010, even with the best care, children with infantile Tay–Sachs disease usually die by the age of 4. Children with the juvenile form are likely to die between the ages of 5–15, while the lifespans of those with the adult form will probably not be affected.[37]",
    "Epidemiology": "Ashkenazi Jews have a high incidence of Tay–Sachs and other lipid storage diseases. In the United States, about 1 in 27 to 1 in 30 Ashkenazi Jews is a recessive carrier. The disease incidence is about 1 in every 3,500 newborns among Ashkenazi Jews.[40] French Canadians and the Cajun community of Louisiana have an occurrence similar to the Ashkenazi Jews. Irish Americans have a 1 in 50 chance of being a carrier.[41] In the general population, the incidence of carriers as heterozygotes is about 1 in 300.[9] The incidence is approximately 1 in 320,000 newborns in the general population in the United States.[42]\nThree general classes of theories have been proposed to explain the high frequency of Tay–Sachs carriers in the Ashkenazi Jewish population:\nTay–Sachs disease was one of the first genetic disorders for which epidemiology was studied using molecular data. Studies of Tay–Sachs mutations using new molecular techniques such as linkage disequilibrium and coalescence analysis have brought an emerging consensus among researchers supporting the founder effect theory.[44][46][47]"

    "Disease": "Thanatophoric dysplasia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Infants with this condition have disproportionately short arms and legs with extra folds of skin. Other signs of the disorder include a narrow chest, small ribs, underdeveloped lungs, and an enlarged head with a large forehead and prominent, wide-spaced eyes.\nThanatophoric dysplasia is a lethal skeletal dysplasia divided into two subtypes. Type I is characterized by extreme rhizomelia, bowed long bones, narrow thorax, a relatively large head, normal trunk length and absent cloverleaf skull. The spine shows platyspondyly, the cranium has a short base, and, frequently, the foramen magnum is decreased in size. The forehead is prominent, and hypertelorism and a saddle nose may be present. Hands and feet are normal, but fingers are short. Type II is characterized by short, straight long bones and cloverleaf skull.[1]\nIt presents with typical telephone-handle shaped long bones and H-shaped vertebrae.[citation needed]",
    "Causes": "It can be associated with missense mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor-3. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.[2][3]\nWhile the condition can be inherited, most cases of thanatophoric dysplasia are caused by new mutations in people with no family history of the disorder. No individual with thanatophoric dysplasia is known to have had children, so the disorder has not been observed to have been passed down to the next generation. Thanatophoric dysplasia occurs in 1 in 20,000 to 50,000 newborns, and type I thanatophoric dysplasia is more common than type II thanatophoric dysplasia.[4]",
    "Diagnosis": "Infants with type 1 thanatophoric dysplasia also have curved thigh bones, flattened bones of the spine (platyspondyly) and shortened thoracic ribs. Note: Prenatal ultra-sound images of the ribs sometimes appear asymmetrical when in fact they are not. In certain cases, this has caused a misdiagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) type II.[citation needed]\nAn unusual head shape called kleeblattschaedel (\"cloverleaf skull\") can be seen with type 2 thanatophoric dysplasia.[5]",
    "Prognosis": "The term thanatophoric is Greek for \"death bearing\". Children with this condition are usually stillborn or die shortly after birth from respiratory failure. A small number have survived into childhood, and a very few beyond. Survivors have difficulty breathing on their own and require respiratory support such as high flow oxygen through a canula or ventilator support via tracheostomy. There may also be evidence of spinal stenosis and seizures.\nThe oldest known living TD survivor as of 2013 was a 29-year-old woman.[6] One man lived to be 26 years old. Another man lived to age 20. It was reported in 1998 that a 21 year old man with the condition lived in the United States, while two children with TD (aged 10 and 12, a boy and a girl) were known in Germany. There was also a 6-year-old boy living with TD and two 1-year-old boys.[7] As of 2024, Christopher Álvarez, 27, is a Colombian living with TD in New York City.[8]"

    "Disease": "Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The signs and symptoms of TTP may at first be subtle and nonspecific. Many people experience an influenza-like or diarrheal illness before developing TTP.[7] Neurological symptoms are very common and vary greatly in severity. Frequently reported symptoms include feeling very tired, confusion, and headaches.[7] Seizures and symptoms similar to those of a stroke can also be seen.[7] Other symptoms include, but are not limited to jaundice or paleness of the skin, a fast heart rate or shortness of breath,[8] or dots on the skin known as petechiae.[9] High blood pressure has also been observed as a symptom.[10]\nAs TTP progresses, blood clots form within small blood vessels (microvasculature), and platelets (clotting cells) are consumed. As a result, bruising, and rarely bleeding can occur. The bruising often takes the form of purpura, while the most common site of bleeding, if it occurs, is from the nose or gums. Larger bruises (ecchymoses) may also develop.[11] The classic presentation of TTP, which occurs in less than 10% of people, includes five medical signs. These are:[3]",
    "Causes": "TTP, as with other microangiopathic hemolytic anemias (MAHAs), is caused by spontaneous aggregation of platelets and activation of coagulation in the small blood vessels. Platelets are consumed in the aggregation process and bind vWF. These platelet-vWF complexes form small blood clots which circulate in the blood vessels and cause shearing of red blood cells, resulting in their rupture and formation of schistocytes.[12] The two best understood causes of TTP are due to autoimmunity (acquired TTP), caused by autoantibodies targeting ADAMTS13,[13] or congenital TTP: an inherited deficiency of ADAMTS13 (known as the Upshaw–Schulman syndrome).[12]\nIn 1998, the majority of cases were shown to be caused by the inhibition of the enzyme ADAMTS13 by antibodies. Knowledge of this relationship between reduced ADAMTS13 and the pathogenesis of TTP is credited to two independent groups of researchers (Furlan and Tsai) who published their research in the same issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.[14]\nADAMTS13 is a metalloproteinase responsible for the breakdown of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a protein that links platelets, blood clots, and the blood vessel wall in the process of blood coagulation. Very large vWF multimers are more prone to lead to coagulation. Hence, without proper cleavage of vWF by ADAMTS13, coagulation occurs at a higher rate, especially in the microvasculature, part of the blood vessel system where vWF is most active due to high shear stress.[5]\nTTP may also be congenital. Such cases may be caused by mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene.[17][18] This hereditary form of TTP is called Upshaw–Schulman syndrome (also spelled Upshaw–Schülman).[19][20] People with this inherited ADAMTS13 deficiency have a surprisingly mild phenotype, but develop TTP in clinical situations with increased von Willebrand factor levels (e.g. infection). Reportedly, less than 5% of all TTP cases are due to Upshaw–Schulman syndrome.[21] People with this syndrome generally have 5–10% of normal ADAMTS-13 activity.[22][23]\nA 2024 study suggested that hereditary TTP is underdiagnosed and should be considered in cases of unexplained stroke, neonatal jaundice, and severe pre-eclampsia.[24] The study estimated the global prevalence of hereditary TTP at 40 per million, in contrast to previously reported estimates of 0.5 to 2.0 per million.[19]\nSecondary TTP is diagnosed when the person's history mentions one of the known features associated with TTP. It comprises about 40% of all cases of TTP. Predisposing factors are:[12]\nThe mechanism of secondary TTP is poorly understood, as ADAMTS13 activity is generally not as depressed as in idiopathic TTP, and inhibitors cannot be detected. Probable etiology may involve, at least in some cases, endothelial damage,[26] although the formation of thrombi resulting in vessel occlusion may not be essential in the pathogenesis of secondary TTP.[27] These factors may also be considered a form of secondary aHUS; people presenting with these features are, therefore, potential candidates for anticomplement therapy.",
    "Diagnosis": "Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) initially presents with a range of symptoms that may include severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count usually < 30,000/mm³), microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (evidenced by schistocytes in the blood smear), and various clinical signs such as petechiae, purpura, neurologic symptoms, myocardial ischemia, mesenteric ischemia, and renal abnormalities. Notably, the complete classic pentad of TTP symptoms—microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal abnormalities, fever, and neurologic abnormalities—is only seen in about 10% of acute cases at initial presentation.[30] Clinical suspicion of TTP is often established with an initial emergent presentation of one or more classic symptoms and a complete blood count revealing severe thrombocytopenia.[31]\nThe PLASMIC score,[32] Bentley score,[33] and French TMA score[34] have been used to assess clinical probability of TTP.[35]\nA definitive diagnosis of TTP may be established when a laboratory assay of ADAMTS13 identifies under 10% of normal enzyme function. Borderline or normal ADAMTS13 activity suggests a different diagnosis is more likely.[31]\nThe ISTH guidelines suggested diagnostic and early management strategy.[36] Suggestions included 1) for high pretest probability based on PLASMIC score or French score, start TPE and corticosteroids, and collect plasma samples for ADAMTS13 testing before therapy. Consider caplacizumab if ADAMTS13 test results are expected within 72 hours.  If ADAMTS13 <10 IU/dL, continue caplacizumab and rituximab. If ADAMTS13 is ≥20 IU/dL, consider to stop caplacizumab and seek other diagnoses. If ADAMTS13 activity is borderline, use clinical judgment; 2) for low or intermediate pretest probability, still consider TPE and corticosteroids, but withhold caplacizumab until plasma ADAMTS13 test results are available; if ADAMTS13 activity is <10 IU/dL, consider adding caplacizumab and rituximab; if ADAMTS13 activity is ≥20 IU/dL, no caplacizumab should be used and other diagnoses should be sought; if ADAMTS13 activity falls borderline, consider other diagnoses.\nTTP is a form of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA),[37] the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body, which can lead to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia.[37] This characteristic is shared by two related syndromes, hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS).[4] Consequently, differential diagnosis of these TMA diseases is essential. Both TTP and HUS are characterized by fever, anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, and neurological symptoms. Generally, TTP has higher rates of neurological symptoms (≤80%) and lower rates of renal symptoms (9%) than HUS (10–20% and 90%, respectively).[38]\nUnlike HUS and aHUS,[39][40] TTP is known to be caused by a defect in the ADAMTS13 protein,[41] so a lab test showing ≤5% of normal ADAMTS13 levels is indicative of TTP.[28] ADAMTS13 levels above 5%, coupled with a positive test for shiga-toxin/enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), are more likely indicative of HUS,[42] whereas absence of shiga-toxin/EHEC can confirm a diagnosis of aHUS.[28]",
    "Treatment": "Due to the high mortality of untreated TTP, a presumptive diagnosis of TTP is made even when only microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia are seen, and therapy is started. Transfusion is contraindicated in thrombotic TTP, as it fuels the coagulopathy. Since the early 1990s, plasmapheresis has become the treatment of choice for TTP.[43][44] This is an exchange transfusion involving removal of the person's blood plasma through apheresis and replacement with donor plasma (fresh frozen plasma or cryosupernatant); the procedure must be repeated daily to eliminate the inhibitor and abate the symptoms. If apheresis is not available, fresh frozen plasma can be infused, but the volume that can be given safely is limited due to the danger of fluid overload.[45] Plasma infusion alone is not as beneficial as plasma exchange.[43] Corticosteroids (prednisone or prednisolone) are usually given.[44] Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody aimed at the CD20 molecule on B lymphocytes, may be used on diagnosis; this is thought to kill the B cells and thereby reduce the production of the inhibitor.[44] A stronger recommendation for rituximab exists where TTP does not respond to corticosteroids and plasmapheresis.[44]\nCaplacizumab is an adjunct option in treating TTP as it has been shown that it induces a faster disease resolution compared with those people who were on placebo.[46] However, the use of caplacizumab was associated with increase bleeding tendencies in some studied subjects.[47] Its cost-effectiveness has also been questioned.[48] Use of caplacizumab without plasmapheresis has been reported in select patients.[49] The MAYARI study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of this option.\n[50]\nThe ISTH guidelines[51] recommended for first acute episode and relapses of immune-mediated TTP (iTTP), add corticosteroids to therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) and consider adding rituximab and caplacizumab. For asymptomatic iTTP with low plasma ADAMTS13 activity, consider rituximab outside of pregnancy, but prophylactic TPE during pregnancy. For asymptomatic congenital TTP, offer prophylactic plasma infusion during pregnancy, and consider plasma infusion or a wait and watch approach outside of pregnancy.\nPeople with refractory or relapsing TTP may receive additional immunosuppressive therapy, e.g. vincristine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine A, or splenectomy.[3][45]\nChildren with Upshaw-Schulman syndrome receive prophylactic plasma every two to three weeks; this maintains adequate levels of functioning ADAMTS13. Some tolerate longer intervals between plasma infusions. Additional plasma infusions may be necessary for triggering events, such as surgery; alternatively, the platelet count may be monitored closely around these events with plasma being administered if the count drops.[52]\nMeasurements of blood levels of lactate dehydrogenase, platelets, and schistocytes are used to monitor disease progression or remission.[13][53] ADAMTS13 activity and inhibitor levels may be measured during follow-up, but in those without symptoms the use of rituximab is not recommended.[44]\nApadamtase alfa (Adzynma) was approved for medical use in the United States in November 2023.[54][55] The use of ADAMTS13 is well established for the treatment of congenital TTP.[56]",
    "Prognosis": "The mortality rate is around 95% for untreated cases, but the prognosis is reasonably favorable (80–90% survival) for people with idiopathic TTP diagnosed and treated early with plasmapheresis.[57]",
    "Epidemiology": "The incidence of TTP is about 4–5 cases per million people per year.[58] Idiopathic TTP occurs more often in women as well as people of African descent, and TTP secondary to autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus occurs more frequently in people of African descent, although other secondary forms do not show this distribution.[59] Although Black people are at an increased risk for TTP, its presentation in Black people does not have any distinguishable features compared to those of other races.[60] Pregnant women and women in the post partum period accounted for a notable portion (12–31%) of the cases in some studies; TTP affects about one in 25,000 pregnancies.[61]"

    "Disease": "Timothy syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The most striking sign of Timothy syndrome type 1 is the co-occurrence of both syndactyly (about 0.03% of births) and long QT syndrome (1% per year) in a single patient. Other common symptoms include cardiac arrhythmia (94%), heart malformations (59%), and autism or an autism spectrum disorder (80% who survive long enough for evaluation). Facial dysmorphologies such as flattened noses also occur in about half of patients. Children with this disorder have small teeth, which is due to poor enamel coating, are prone to dental cavities and often require removal. The average age of death due to complications of these symptoms is 2.5 years,[2][3][4] although there have been multiple reports of patients living in to their mid- or late-twenties.[5]\nTimothy syndrome type 2 has largely the same symptoms as the classical form. Differences in the type 2 form are the lack of syndactyly, the presence of musculoskeletal problems (particularly hyperflexible joints), and often hip dysplasia. Patients with Timothy syndrome type 2 also have more facial deformities, including protruding foreheads and tongues.[6]\nChildren with Timothy syndrome tend to be born via caesarean section due to fetal distress.[2][3]",
    "Diagnosis": "Syndactyly and other deformities are typically observed and diagnosed at birth. Long QT syndrome sometimes presents itself as a complication due to surgery to correct syndactyly. Other times, children collapse spontaneously while playing. In all cases, it is confirmed with ECG measurements. Sequencing of the CACNA1C gene further confirms the diagnosis.[5]",
    "Treatment": "Surgery is typically used to correct structural heart defects and syndactyly. Propranolol or other beta-adrenergic blockers are often prescribed, as well as insertion of a pacemaker to maintain proper heart rhythm. With the characterization of Timothy syndrome mutations indicating that they cause defects in calcium currents, calcium channel blockers may be effective as a therapeutic agent.[6]",
    "Prognosis": "The prognosis for patients diagnosed with Timothy syndrome is very poor. Of 17 children analyzed in one study, 10 died at an average age of 2.5 years. Of those that did survive, three were diagnosed with autism, one with an autism spectrum disorder, and the last had severe delays in language development.[4] One patient with the G402S mutation was largely normal with the exception of heart arrhythmia.[6] Likewise, the mother of two Timothy syndrome patients also carried the mutation, but lacked any obvious phenotype. In both of these cases, however, the lack of severity of the disorder was due to mosaicism.[6][4]"

    "Disease": "Tolosa%E2%80%93Hunt syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Symptoms are usually limited to one side of the head. In most cases, the individual affected will experience intense, sharp pain and paralysis of muscles around the eye.[3] Symptoms may subside without medical intervention, yet recur without a noticeable pattern.[4] Patients with this disorder describe it as almost like being stabbed in the head. The pain also comes from behind the eyes, forehead, and around the temple area. Not only is the disorder painful, but it is also severe.\nIn addition, affected individuals may experience paralysis of various facial nerves and drooping of the upper eyelid (ptosis). Other signs include double vision, fever, chronic fatigue, vertigo or arthralgia. Occasionally, the patient may present with a feeling of protrusion of one or both eyeballs (exophthalmos).[3][4]  Patients may lose their sight, and experience nausea and vomiting.[5]\nTolosa-Hunt Syndrome should not be mistaken for idiopathic inflammatory orbital pseudotumor (IIPO).[6] Both disorders have similar symptoms and respond similarly to steroid medications.\nThese may go for up to 8 weeks. Treatment can reduce the symptoms, but the disorder may recur.[5] In one clinical case in 2019, a 14-year-old boy was admitted to the hospital as he exhibited severe headaches, but MRI scans showed no brain abnormalities. Over 4 weeks, the symptoms worsened, and the patient showed paralysis in the mouth region. After being given medications to alleviate the symptoms, symptoms came back after 8 weeks and the patient had to get hospitalized.[7]\nThese also can return unpredictably, sometimes with months or years.",
    "Causes": "The cause of Tolosa–Hunt syndrome is not known. The disorder is thought to be, and often assumed to be, associated with inflammation of the areas behind the eyes (cavernous sinus and superior orbital fissure).[8] These granulomatous inflammations involve lymphocytes, plasma cells, and multinucleate giant cells. Clinical cases have shown that the disorder consists of the inflammation of multiple cranial nerves, with the highest prevalence of ocular motor nerves. In some cases, it also involves the inflammation of sensory nerves, specifically the trigeminal nerves.",
    "Diagnosis": "Symptoms come from the International Classification of Headache Disorders which was done in 2013.[7]\nDue to the nature of the disorder, biopsy has been recommended as the best tool to assess whether a patient has the disorder or not.\nTolosa–Hunt syndrome is also diagnosed via exclusion, and as such, a vast amount of laboratory tests are required to rule out other causes of the patient's symptoms.[3] These tests include a complete blood count (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, glucose, hemoglobin A1c, electrolytes, liver function tests),[7] thyroid function tests and serum protein electrophoresis.[3] Studies of cerebrospinal fluid (cell count and differential, cultures such as bacterial, fungal, viral, glucose, oligoclonal bands, opening pressure and protein) and serologic testing (angiotensin-converting enzyme, antinuclear antibody, anti-dsDNA, antimitochondrial antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, borrelia burgdorferi serology, HIV).[7] may also be beneficial in distinguishing between Tolosa–Hunt syndrome and conditions with similar signs and symptoms.[3]\nMRI scans of the brain and orbit with and without contrast, magnetic resonance angiography or digital subtraction angiography and a CT scan of the brain and orbit with and without contrast may all be useful in detecting inflammatory changes in the cavernous sinus, superior orbital fissure and/or orbital apex.[3] Inflammatory change of the orbit on cross-sectional imaging in the absence of cranial nerve palsy is described by the more benign and general nomenclature of orbital pseudotumor.[citation needed] Sometimes a biopsy may need to be obtained to confirm the diagnosis, as it is useful in ruling out a neoplasm.[3] Other diagnoses to consider include craniopharyngioma, migraine and meningioma.[3]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment of Tolosa–Hunt syndrome includes immunosuppressives such as corticosteroids (often prednisolone) or steroid-sparing agents (such as methotrexate or azathioprine).[3]\nRadiotherapy has also been proposed[9] as an addition.[10] For patients to be given additional form of treatment, they need to perform follow up check ups.[11]\nAlthough there are known medications for patients, there is not much known about the instructions on administering the medications. Most medications given to patients with this disorder are based on other corticosteroids and other steroids, in which patients will be given a high dosage at first, and as it goes on, the dosage is decreased. Most patients will experience pain relief between 24–72 hours after the medications are given, but these times depend on the type of symptoms that the patient is experiencing.[11] Recurrences are common despite the alleviation of the symptoms. Additionally, depending on the severity of the disorder, not everyone responds the same way. Some patients may respond well to medications, while some patients may not need them at all. Doctors advise on proper diagnosis and evaluation.[12]",
    "Prognosis": "Tolosa–Hunt syndrome typically has a good prognosis. Patients usually respond to corticosteroids, and spontaneous remission can occur, although movement of ocular muscles may remain damaged.[3] Roughly 30–40% of patients who are treated for Tolosa–Hunt syndrome experience a relapse.[3]",
    "Epidemiology": "Tolosa-Hunt syndrome affects all age groups, but most cases have been in adults aged 40–50 years, with the average age being 41 years.[11] There is no specific gender of the disorder, but most cases have shown a higher prevalence for males than females. Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome in the pediatric population is similar to that of adults. In addition, the cases have been found in multiple continents such as America, Europe, Asia, and Africa, thus, it is not known whether there are any differences between populations of different ethnic and racial makeup.[16] Currently, there is about one case per million a year.[11]\nSome reports have shown that the disorder is more common in adults than children, but many other pediatric cases have been reported. Some indicate that diagnoses in children are more difficult than in adults due to children's difficulty in describing the disorder to doctors. This could be a problem when finding treatment for the disorder.[17]"

TBM can be caused by damage to the support cartilage or membranous wall of the trachea, this can be the result of physical trauma (such as from prolonged Tracheal intubation) or pathological changes caused by inflammatory diseases like Relapsing polychondritis.[5] In patients with TBM in one study, the number of longitudinal elastic fibers in the pars of membranacea was reduced throughout the whole trachea.[6]\nPeople with heritable connective tissue disorders like Ehlers–Danlos syndrome seem to have at an increased risk of both congenital and acquired TBM, although the extent of that risk is unknown.[7]\nThere have been studies linking long-term use of inhaled Corticosteroids to Tracheobronchomalacia.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis is conducted according to the severity of the symptoms. Initially pulmonary function tests[8] are administered. These tests include the lungs' capability of air intake and outtake, and gas flow of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the body and environment. Following these function tests a special type of Chest CT scan or a bronchoscopy will be ordered. The results of the scan and bronchoscopy[9] will display the status of the condition. A mild case of tracheobronchomalacia would be if the patient's trachea condenses 50% of its normal space when exhaling. Moderate tracheobronchomalacia would be 25% of the normal trachea space constricting and a severe case would be if the walls touch each other.[10]\nTracheobronchomalacia is thought to be underdiagnosed as mild cases may be asymptomatic and symptoms are often mistaken for more common respiratory conditions like Asthma and Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.[11]",
    "Treatment": "To properly treat a patient with tracheobronchomalacia, the subtype must be determined (primary or secondary). After the type is named, the cause must be identified, whether it is from genetics, a trauma accident, or chronic tracheal illness. If a trauma case or chronic tracheal illnesses were the cause, the first steps of treatment would be to address these underlying issues. If the cause is genetic or the previous underlying issues could not be fixed, other treatments would be assessed. More severe treatments include silicone stenting to prevent tracheal constriction, surgery to strengthen or attempt to rebuild the walls, continuous positive airway pressure[12] that has a machine blow small amounts of air into the trachea to keep it open (mainly at night), or a tracheostomy,[13] which is surgically inserted into the patient's neck that leads to the trachea to help with breathing. Another form of treatment may include a tracheobronchoplasty which is a specific surgical procedure that helps control the airway by splinting the trachea. The splint helps strengthen the trachea with the hopes that the symptoms improve.[2] People with tracheobronchomalacia who do not experience symptoms do not need treatment and are often undiagnosed.[2]\nOn 28 May 2013, it was reported that a cure had been developed via a 3D printed windpipe.[14] This cure has currently saved the lives of at least 3 infants."

    "Disease": "Transient acantholytic dermatosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Grover's disease often starts quite suddenly. There are intensely itchy spots on the central back, mid chest and occasionally elsewhere. Frequently, it follows sweating or some unexpected heat stress.\nThe itchy eruption lasts an average of 10–12 months. It is characterized by papules and papulovesicles with excoriations occurring on the chest, back, lower sternum, arms, and thighs.[4]  The papules are most commonly found on the mid chest.\nSometimes the features of Grover's are found in people who do not itch or have a conspicuous rash.  Most of the people with Grover's who visit a dermatologist, however, itch a lot.",
    "Causes": "The cause of Grover's disease is unknown. Suspected triggers of disease activity include heat and sweating, sunlight, and adverse reaction to medications[5]: 24  as well as ionizing radiation, end-stage renal disease/hemodialysis, and mechanical irritation or prolonged bed rest.\nSome cases of Grover's disease have been associated with medications such as sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, ribavirin, cetuximab, and interleukin-4 [1,8-15]. One series of 300 patients with Grover's disease reported an association with other coexisting dermatoses including atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, and xerosis cutis.[6] More recent reports have indicated a connection with the Pfizer vaccine for Covid-19[7] and as a presenting symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection itself.[8]  Finally, smaller series have detailed an association with pyoderma gangrenosum, bacterial and viral infections, and occasionally, malignancies.[9]",
    "Diagnosis": "Grover's may be suspected by its appearance, but since it has such a characteristic appearance under the microscope a shave skin or punch biopsy is often performed.",
    "Treatment": "Sweating causes lesions to form, but lesions aggravated by sweat usually return to \"normal\" fairly quickly—avoiding sweat is not considered a reason to avoid exercise. Minor outbreaks can be controlled with prescription strength topical cortisone creams. More severe eruptions usually clear up after treatment for one to three months with Accutane or tetracycline. If these fail or the outbreak is severe, PUVA phototherapy treatments, antifungal medication and cortisone injections are alternatives.[10]\nSome research has suggested a correlation of Grover's disease with mercury toxicity[11] in which case Dimercaptosuccinic acid might help.[12]",
    "Epidemiology": "The prevalence and incidence of Grover's disease have not been firmly established. In a study from Switzerland, Grover's disease was diagnosed in just 24 of more than 30,000 skin biopsies.[4] Grover's disease is mainly seen in males over the age of forty.[13]\nGrover's disease affects chiefly white adults in the fifth decade or later, and appears to be around 1.6 to 2.1 times more common in men than in women. Grover's disease appears less commonly in darker-skinned individuals.[citation needed][9]"

    "Disease": "Transverse myelitis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Symptoms include weakness and numbness of the limbs, deficits in sensation and motor skills, dysfunctional urethral and anal sphincter activities, and dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system that can lead to episodes of high blood pressure.[1] Symptoms typically develop for hours to a few weeks.[1][4] Sensory symptoms of TM may include a sensation of pins and needles traveling up from the feet.[1]  The degree and type of sensory loss will depend upon the extent of the involvement of the various sensory tracts, but there is often a \"sensory level\" at the spinal ganglion of the segmental spinal nerve, below which sensation of pain or light touch is impaired.  Motor weakness occurs due to the involvement of the pyramidal tracts and mainly affects the muscles that flex the legs and extend the arms.[1]\nDisturbances in sensory nerves and motor nerves and dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system at the level of the lesion or below, are noted. Therefore, the signs and symptoms depend on the area of the spine involved.[5] Back pain can occur at the level of any inflamed segment of the spinal cord.[1]\nIf the upper cervical segment of the spinal cord is involved, all four limbs may be affected and there is the risk of respiratory failure – the phrenic nerve which is formed by the cervical spinal nerves C3, C4, and C5 innervates the main muscle of respiration, the diaphragm.[6]\nLesions of the lower cervical region (C5–T1) will cause a combination of upper and lower motor neuron signs in the upper limbs, and exclusively upper motor neuron signs in the lower limbs. Cervical lesions account for about 20% of cases.[5]\nA lesion of the thoracic segment (T1–12) will produce upper motor neuron signs in the lower limbs, presenting as a spastic paraparesis. This is the most common location of the lesion, and therefore most individuals will have weakness in the lower limbs.[7]\nA lesion of the lumbar segment, the lower part of the spinal cord (L1–S5) often produces a combination of upper and lower motor neuron signs in the lower limbs. Lumbar lesions account for about 10% of cases.[5]",
    "Causes": "TM is a heterogeneous condition, that is, there are several identified causes. Sometimes the term Transverse myelitis spectrum disorder is used.[8] In 60% of patients the cause is idiopathic.[9] In rare cases, it may be associated with meningococcal meningitis[10]\nWhen it appears as a comorbid condition with neuromyelitis optica (NMO), it is considered to be caused by NMO-IgG autoimmunity, and when it appears in multiple sclerosis (MS) cases, it's misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis (MS) or seen as a type of MS. But NMO is a different condition.[11]\nOther causes of TM include infections, immune system disorders, and demyelinating diseases.[12] Viral infections known to be associated with TM include HIV, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr.[13] Flavivirus infections such as Zika virus and West Nile virus have also been associated. Viral association of  transverse myelitis could result from the infection itself or from the response to it.[12] Bacterial causes associated with TM include Mycoplasma pneumoniae,  Bartonella henselae, and the types of Borrelia that cause Lyme disease. Lyme disease gives rise to neuroborreliosis  which is seen in a small percentage (4 to 5  per cent) of acute transverse myelitis cases.[14] The diarrhea-causing bacteria Campylobacter jejuni is also a reported cause of transverse myelitis.[15]\nOther associated causes include the helminth infection schistosomiasis, spinal cord injuries, vascular disorders that impede the blood flow through vessels of the spinal cord, and paraneoplastic syndrome.[12] Another exceptionally rare cause is heroin associated transverse myelitis.[16][17]",
    "Diagnosis": "In 2002, the Transverse Myelitis Consortium Working Group proposed the following diagnostic criteria for idiopathic acute transverse myelitis:[21]\nIndividuals who develop TM are typically transferred to a neurologist who can urgently investigate the patient in a hospital. If breathing is affected, particularly in upper spinal cord lesions, methods of artificial ventilation must be on hand before and during the transfer procedure. The patient should also be catheterized to test for and, if necessary, drain an over-distended bladder. A lumbar puncture can be performed after the MRI or at the time of  CT myelography. Corticosteroids are often given in high doses when symptoms begin with the hope that the degree of inflammation and swelling of the spinal cord will be lessened, but whether this is truly effective is still debated.[2]\nThe differential diagnosis of acute TM includes demyelinating disorders, such as multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica, infections, such as herpes zoster and herpes simplex virus, and other types of inflammatory disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and neurosarcoidosis. It is important to also rule out an acute cause of compression on the spinal cord.[22]",
    "Treatment": "If treated early, some people experience a complete or near complete recovery. Treatment options also vary according to the underlying cause. One treatment option includes plasmapheresis.[23] Recovery from TM is variable between individuals and also depends on the underlying cause. Some patients begin to recover between weeks 2 and 12 following onset and may continue to improve for up to two years. Other patients may never show signs of recovery.[24]",
    "Prognosis": "The prognosis for TM depends on whether there is improvement in 3 to 6 months. Complete recovery is unlikely if no improvement occurs within this time. Incomplete recovery can still occur; however, aggressive physical therapy and rehabilitation will be very important. One-third of people with TM experience full recovery, one-third experience fair recovery but have significant neurological deficits, such as spastic gait. The final third experience no recovery at all.[12]",
    "Epidemiology": "The incidence of TM is 4.6 per 1 million per year, affecting men and women equally. TM can occur at any age, but there are peaks around age 10, age 20, and after age 40.[25]",
    "Society and culture": "In 2016, former Slipknot drummer Joey Jordison revealed that he had been hospitalised by the disease in 2013 and that this was the reason for his controversial firing.[34] As the first celebrity to publicly speak about having transverse myelitis, this helped to raise public awareness of the disease. Jordison died in his sleep on July 26, 2021,[35] however it is not known whether the disease had any connection to his death."

    "Disease": "Treacher Collins syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Symptoms in people with Treacher Collins syndrome vary. Some individuals are so mildly affected that they remain undiagnosed, while others have moderate to severe facial involvement and life-threatening airway compromise.[9] Most of the features of TCS are symmetrical and are already recognizable at birth.[3]\nThe most common symptom of Treacher Collins syndrome is underdevelopment of the lower jaw and underdevelopment of the zygomatic bone. This can be accompanied by the tongue being retracted. The small mandible can result in a poor occlusion of the teeth or in more severe cases, trouble breathing or swallowing. The respiratory system of a child with Treacher Collins syndrome is the primary concern at birth, with other issues only addressed once respiratory function has been stabilized.[10] Underdevelopment of the zygomatic bone gives the cheeks a sunken appearance.[11][12]\nThe external ear is sometimes small, rotated, malformed, or absent entirely in people with TCS. Symmetric, bilateral narrowing or absence of the external ear canal, is also described.[12][13] In most cases, the bones of the middle ear and the middle ear cavity are misshapen. Inner ear malformations are rarely described. As a result of these abnormalities, a majority of the individuals with TCS have conductive hearing loss.[12][14]\nMost affected people also experience eye problems, including coloboma (notches) in the lower eyelids, partial or complete absence of eyelashes on the lower lid, downward angled eyelids, drooping of upper and lower eyelids, and narrowing of the tear ducts. Vision loss can occur and is associated with strabismus, refractive errors, and anisometropia. It can also be caused by severely dry eyes, a consequence of lower eyelid abnormalities and frequent eye infections.[12][13][15][16]\nAlthough an abnormally shaped skull is not distinctive for Treacher Collins syndrome, brachycephaly with bitemporal narrowing is sometimes observed.[13] Cleft palate is also common.[12]\nDental anomalies are seen in 60% of affected people, including tooth agenesis (33%), discoloration (enamel opacities) (20%), malplacement of the maxillary first molars (13%), and wide spacing of the teeth. In some cases, dental anomalies in combination with mandible hypoplasia result in a malocclusion. This can lead to problems with food intake and the ability to close the mouth.[12]\nLess common features of TCS may add to an affected person's breathing problems, including sleep apnea. Choanal atresia or stenosis is a narrowing or absence of the choanae, the internal opening of the nasal passages, which may also be observed. Underdevelopment of the pharynx can also narrow the airway.[12]\nFeatures related to TCS that are seen less frequently include nasal deformities, high-arched palate, macrostomia, preauricular hair displacement, cleft palate, hypertelorism, notched upper eyelid, and congenital heart defects.[11][12][16]\nAlthough facial deformity is often associated with developmental delay and intellectual disability, more than 95% of people affected with TCS have normal intelligence.[12] The psychological and social problems associated with facial deformity can affect quality of life in individuals with TCS.",
    "Diagnosis": "TCS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and the penetrance of the affected gene is almost complete.[26] Some recent investigations, though, described some rare cases in which the penetrance in TCS was not complete. Causes may be a variable expressivity, an incomplete penetrance[27] or germline mosaicism.[28] Only 40% of the mutations are inherited. The remaining 60% are a result of a de novo mutation, where a child has a new mutation in the responsible gene and did not inherit it from either parent.[12][29] In the outcome of the disease, inter- and intrafamilial variability occurs. This suggests that when an affected child is born, it is important to investigate the parents to determine whether the affected gene is present, because the parent could have a mild form of the disease that has not been diagnosed. In this case, the risk of having another affected child is 50%. If the parents do not have the affected gene, the recurrence risk appears to be low.[26] In following generations, the severity of the clinical symptoms increases.[21]\nMutations in the main genes responsible for TCS can be detected with chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis. Rare mutations may not be detected by these methods. Ultrasonography can be used to detect craniofacial abnormalities later in pregnancy, but may not detect milder cases.[12]\nTCS is often first suspected with characteristic symptoms observed during a physical exam. The clinical presentation of TCS can resemble other diseases, making diagnosis difficult.[30] The OMENS classification was developed as a comprehensive and stage-based approach to differentiate the diseases. This acronym describes five distinct dysmorphic manifestations, namely orbital asymmetry, mandibular hypoplasia, auricular deformity, nerve development, and soft-tissue disease.[31]\nOrbital symmetry\nMandible\nEar\nFacial nerve\nSoft tissue\nA few techniques are used to confirm the diagnosis in TCS.[30][32]\nAn orthopantomogram (OPG) is a panoramic dental X-ray of the upper and lower jaw. It shows a two-dimensional image from ear to ear. Particularly, OPG facilitates an accurate postoperative follow-up and monitoring of bone growth under a mono- or double-distractor treatment. Thereby, some TCS features could be seen on OPG, but better techniques are used to include the whole spectrum of TCS abnormalities instead of showing only the jaw abnormalities.[30]\nAnother method of radiographic evaluation is taking an X-ray image of the whole head. The lateral cephalometric radiograph in TCS shows hypoplasia of the facial bones, like the malar bone, mandible, and the mastoid.[30]\nFinally, occipitomental radiographs are used to detect hypoplasia or discontinuity of the zygomatic arch.[32]\nA temporal-bone CT using thin slices makes it possible to diagnose the degree of stenosis and atresia of the external auditory canal, the status of the middle ear cavity, the absent or dysplastic and rudimentary ossicles, or inner ear abnormalities such as a deficient cochlea. Two- and three-dimensional CT reconstructions with VRT and bone and skin-surfacing are helpful for more accurate staging and the three-dimensional  planning of mandibular and external ear reconstructive surgery.[citation needed]\nOther diseases have similar characteristics to Treacher Collins syndrome. In the differential diagnosis, one should consider the acrofacial dysostoses. The facial appearance resembles that of Treacher Collins syndrome, but additional limb abnormalities occur in those persons. Examples of these diseases are Nager syndrome and  Miller syndrome.[3]\nThe oculoauriculovertebral spectrum should also be considered in the differential diagnosis. An example is hemifacial microsomia, which primarily affects development of the ear, mouth, and mandible. This anomaly may occur bilaterally. Another disease which belongs to this spectrum is Goldenhar syndrome, which includes vertebral abnormalities, epibulbar dermoids and facial deformities.[33]",
    "Treatment": "The treatment of individuals with TCS may involve the intervention of professionals from multiple disciplines. The primary concerns are breathing and feeding, as a consequence of the hypoplasia of the mandibula and the obstruction of the hypopharynx by the tongue. Sometimes, they may require a tracheostomy to maintain an adequate airway,[34] and a gastrostomy to assure an adequate caloric intake while protecting the airway. Corrective surgery of the face is performed at defined ages, depending on the developmental state.[35]\nAn overview of the present guidelines:\nHearing loss in Treacher Collins syndrome is caused by deformed structures in the outer and middle ear. The hearing loss is generally bilateral with a conductive loss of about 50–70 dB. Even in cases with normal auricles and open external auditory canals, the ossicular chain is often malformed.[41]\nAttempts to surgically reconstruct the external auditory canal and improve hearing in children with TCS have not yielded positive results.[42]\nAuditory rehabilitation with bone-anchored hearing aids (BAHAs) or a conventional bone conduction aid has proven preferable to surgical reconstruction.[38]\nThe disorder can be associated with a number of psychological symptoms, including anxiety, depression, social phobia, and distress about body image. People who have this disorder may also experience discrimination, bullying, and name calling, especially when young. A multi-disciplinary team and parental support should include these issues.[43]",
    "Epidemiology": "TCS occurs in about one in 50,000 births in Europe.[44] Worldwide, it is estimated to occur in one in 10,000 to one in 50,000 births.[12]",
    "Society and culture": "In July 1977, a New York Times article describing new plastic surgery techniques which could partially correct the appearance of those with Treacher Collins syndrome was widely circulated resulting in raised awareness of the disease.[47]\nPrior to beginning his comedy career, Bob Saget made a documentary short called \"Through Adam's Eyes\" documenting his young nephew's experiences undergoing facial reconstructive surgery due to Treacher Collins; the film won a student Academy Award.[48]\nThe disorder was featured on the show Nip/Tuck, in the episode \"Blu Mondae\".[49] TLC's Born Without a Face[50] features Juliana Wetmore, who was born with the most severe case in medical history of this syndrome and is missing 30%–40% of the bones in her face.[50]\nIn 2010, BBC Three documentary Love Me, Love My Face[51] covered the case of a man, Jono Lancaster, with the condition. In 2011, BBC Three returned to Jono to cover his and his partner Laura's quest to start a family,[2] in So What If My Baby Is Born Like Me?,[52] which first aired as part of a BBC Three season of programmes on parenting.[53] The first film was replayed on BBC One shortly ahead of the second film's initial BBC Three broadcast. Lancaster's third BBC Three film, Finding My Family on Facebook, which looked at adoption, aired in 2011.[54]\nLancaster's memoir about living with the condition, Not All Heroes Wear Capes,[55] published in 2023.\nIn Wonder, a children's novel written by R. J. Palacio, the main character is a child who has Treacher Collins syndrome.[56] A 2017 film adaptation of Wonder, starring Julia Roberts, Owen Wilson and Jacob Tremblay, was released in November 2017.[57][58]\nAlison Midstokke, who appears in the drama film Happy Face (2018),[59] is an actress and activist who has the condition."

    "Disease": "Trichodysplasia spinulosa",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The disease is characterized by flesh-colored to erythematous (reddened) papules occurring in the central region of the face and sometimes elsewhere on the body, often accompanied by protrusive \"spicules\" or spines made of keratin and by alopecia of affected skin, typically the eyebrows and sometimes the eyelashes or scalp hairs. Pruritus (itching) has been described in about a third of reported cases.[2] Facial papules are generally 1- to 3-mm in size.[5]: 415  The condition is considered to be benign, but can be disfiguring; the spines are often prominent, and in later stages the affected facial skin thickens noticeably.[2][3]",
    "Causes": "TS has been reported almost exclusively in immunocompromised patients, primarily organ transplant recipients on regimens of immunosuppressive drugs, and also in patients with hematolymphoid malignancies.[2][3] As of 2016 there were no case reports in the literature describing cases of TS in patients with HIV-AIDS.[2]\nThere is compelling evidence that trichodysplasia spinulosa is caused by a polyomavirus called trichodysplasia spinulosa polyomavirus (TSPyV) or Human polyomavirus 8.[2][3][1][6] There is evidence that exposure to the virus is common among healthy adults; estimates of seroprevalence (that is, prevalence of detectable antibodies against viral proteins) in immunocompetent adults range from 70 to 80% in different sample populations.[3][7][8] TSPyV infects the skin, but viral DNA is rarely detectable there in asymptomatic individuals even if they possess antibodies to the virus indicating exposure.[3] It is not known whether TS represents new primary infection or opportunistic reactivation of a latent infection.[3]",
    "Diagnosis": "TS can be diagnosed based on clinical observations, but is usually confirmed by histopathology of a lesional biopsy or a plucked spicule. Characteristic histological findings include enlarged and abnormally organized hair follicles and hyperproliferation of inner root sheath cells containing large eosinophilic trichohyalin granules. Antibodies against major capsid protein VP1, the major component of the viral capsid, can be used to confirm the presence of viral particles in cell nuclei. Electron microscopy can also be used to detect viral particles. Quantification of viral load can be performed using quantitative PCR, as affected skin demonstrates much higher viral loads compared to unaffected skin or to asymptomatic individuals who test positive for viral DNA.[2][3]\nDifferential diagnosis includes other visually similar conditions affecting the hair follicles, many of which appear as drug side effects.[2] A proposed classification system lists TS as one of a group of cutaneous conditions with similar manifestations and distinct etiologies, collectively called the digitate keratoses.[10] Although confirmed TS is rare, the condition is thought to be underdiagnosed.[2]",
    "Treatment": "There have been too few cases of TS reported for a standard treatment to be established. In some cases, improvement in immune function has been noted to produce spontaneous improvement in TS symptoms. This pattern is consistent with the behavior of other viral diseases found in immunocompromised patients, most relevantly with the nephropathy associated in kidney transplant recipients with the polyomavirus BK virus. Antiviral drugs such as valganciclovir and cidofovir have shown benefit in treating this disorder in case reports.[2][3][11][12]",
    "Prognosis": "TS is considered to be a benign dysplasia, although it can be disfiguring and is sometimes itchy. It is not known whether TS lesions have the potential to develop into cancer; while this outcome has never been reported, some polyomaviruses are oncogenic. The natural history of untreated TS is not known and no long-term studies of its progress have been performed. Improvement in immune function has been reported to resolve symptoms in some individual cases. Treatment with antiviral drugs has also been reported to improve symptoms, but only as long as treatment continues.[2][3]"

  {
    "Disease": "Trigeminal neuralgia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "This disorder is characterized by episodes of severe facial pain along the trigeminal nerve divisions. The trigeminal nerve is a paired cranial nerve that has three major branches - the ophthalmic nerve (V1), the maxillary nerve (V2), and the mandibular nerve (V3). Any or all branches of the nerve may be affected. Trigeminal neuralgia most commonly involves the middle branch (the maxillary nerve or V2) and lower branch (mandibular nerve or V3) of the trigeminal nerve.[10]\nAn individual attack usually lasts from a few seconds to several minutes or hours, but these can repeat for hours with very short intervals between attacks. In other instances, only four to 10 attacks are experienced daily. The episodes of intense pain may occur paroxysmally. To describe the pain sensation, people often describe a trigger area on the face so sensitive that touching or even air currents can trigger an episode, but in many people, the pain is generated spontaneously without any apparent stimulation.\nIt affects lifestyle, as it can be triggered by common activities such as eating, talking, shaving, and brushing teeth. The wind, chewing, and talking can aggravate the condition in many patients. The attacks are said, by those affected, to feel like stabbing electric shocks, burning, sharp, pressing, crushing, exploding, or shooting pain that becomes intractable.[7]\nThe pain also tends to occur in cycles with remissions lasting months or even years. Pain attacks are known to worsen in frequency or severity over time in some people. Pain may migrate to other branches over time, but in some people remains very stable.[11]\nBilateral (occurring on both sides) trigeminal neuralgia is very rare except for trigeminal neuralgia caused by multiple sclerosis (MS). This normally indicates problems with both trigeminal nerves, since one nerve serves the left side of the face and the other serves the right side. Occasional reports of bilateral trigeminal neuralgia reflect successive episodes of unilateral (only one side) pain switching the side of the face rather than pain occurring simultaneously on both sides.[12]\nRapid spreading of the pain, bilateral involvement, or simultaneous participation with other major nerve trunks (such as painful tic convulsive of nerves V and VII or occurrence of symptoms in the V and IX nerves) may suggest a systemic cause. Systemic causes could include MS or expanding cranial tumors.[13]\nThe severity of the pain makes washing the face, shaving, and performing good oral hygiene more difficult. The pain has a significant impact on activities of daily living, especially as those affected live in fear of when they are going to get their next attack of pain and how severe it will be. It can lead to severe depression and anxiety.[14]\nNot all people, though, have the symptoms described above; several variants of TN occur, one of which is atypical trigeminal neuralgia (trigeminal neuralgia, type 2 or trigeminal neuralgia with concomitant pain),[15] based on a recent classification of facial pain.[16] In these instances, a more prolonged, lower-severity background pain can be present for over 50% of the time and is described more as a burning or prickling, rather than a shock.\nTrigeminal pain can also occur after an attack of herpes zoster. Postherpetic neuralgia has the same manifestations as in other parts of the body. Herpes zoster oticus typically presents with inability to move many facial muscles, pain in the ear, taste loss on the front of the tongue, dry eyes and mouth, and a vesicular rash. Less than 1% of varicella zoster infections involve the facial nerve and result in this occurring.[17]\nTrigeminal deafferentation pain (TDP), also termed anesthesia dolorosa, or colloquially as phantom face pain, is from unintentional damage to a trigeminal nerve following attempts to fix a nerve problem surgically. TDP is usually constant with a burning sensation and numbness and is very difficult to treat, as further surgeries are usually ineffective and possibly detrimental to the person.[18]",
    "Causes": "The trigeminal nerve is a mixed cranial nerve responsible for sensory data such as tactition (pressure), thermoception (temperature), and nociception (pain) originating from the face above the jawline; it is also responsible for the motor function of the muscles of mastication (those involved in chewing but not facial expression).[19]\nSeveral theories exist to explain the possible causes of this pain syndrome. The nerve was once thought to be compressed in the opening from the inside to the outside of the skull; but leading research indicates that it is an enlarged or lengthened blood vessel – most commonly the superior cerebellar artery – compressing or throbbing against the microvasculature of the trigeminal nerve near its connection with the pons.[20] Such a compression can injure the nerve's protective myelin sheath and cause erratic and hyperactive functioning of the nerve. This can lead to pain attacks at the slightest stimulation of any area served by the nerve, as well as hindering the nerve's ability to shut off the pain signals after the stimulation ends. This type of injury may rarely be caused by an aneurysm (an outpouching of a blood vessel), by an arteriovenous malformation,[21] by a tumor; such as an arachnoid cyst or meningioma in the cerebellopontine angle;[22] or by a traumatic event, such as a car accident.[23]\nShort-term peripheral compression is often painless.[4] Persistent compression results in local demyelination with no loss of axon potential continuity. Chronic nerve entrapment results in demyelination primarily, with progressive axonal degeneration subsequently.[4] It is, \"therefore widely accepted that trigeminal neuralgia is associated with demyelination of axons in the Gasserian ganglion, the dorsal root, or both.\"[24] This compression may be related to an aberrant branch of the superior cerebellar artery that lies on the trigeminal nerve.[24] Further causes, besides an aneurysm, MS, or cerebellopontine angle tumor, include a posterior fossa tumor, any other expanding lesion, or even brainstem diseases from strokes.[24]\nTrigeminal neuralgia is found in 3–4% of people with MS, according to data from seven studies.[25][26]  This is theorized to be due to damage to the spinal trigeminal complex.[27] Trigeminal pain has a similar presentation in patients with and without MS.[28]\nPostherpetic neuralgia, which occurs after shingles, may cause similar symptoms if the trigeminal nerve is damaged, called Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2.\nWhen no structural cause is apparent, the syndrome is called idiopathic TN.",
    "Diagnosis": "Trigeminal neuralgia is diagnosed by the result of neurological and physical tests, as well as the individual's medical history.[1] Magnetic resonance angiography can be used to detect vascular compression of the trigeminal nerve and refer patients to surgery.[29]\nAs with many conditions without clear physical or laboratory diagnoses, TN is often misdiagnosed, and other conditions are also frequently misdiagnosed as TN.[30][31] A person with TN may see three or four clinicians before a firm diagnosis is made.[30]\nTemporomandibular disorder (TMD) can present similarly to TN; differentiating between these conditions can be difficult.[32] Even suspected TN patients who experience brief attacks of sharp pain have had their symptoms resolve after being treated for TMD.[33] TMD pain can also be triggered by movements of the tongue or facial muscles, so TN must be differentiated from masticatory pain by differentiating between the clinical characteristics of deep somatic pain and neuropathic pain. Masticatory pain will not be arrested by a conventional mandibular local anesthetic block.[13] One quick test a dentist might perform is a conventional inferior dental local anesthetic block. If the pain is in the treated branch, the block will not arrest masticatory pain but will alleviate TN pain.[34]",
    "Treatment": "Some evidence points towards the need to quickly treat and diagnose TN. The longer a patient has TN, reversing the neural pathways associated with the pain are thought to be more difficult.[citation needed]\nMicrovascular decompression provides freedom from pain in about 75% of patients presenting with drug-resistant TN.[40][41][42] While there may be pain relief after surgery, there is also a risk of adverse effects, such as facial numbness. Percutaneous radiofrequency thermorhizotomy may also be effective[43] as may stereotactic radiosurgery; however the effectiveness decreases with time.[44]\nSurgical procedures can be separated into nondestructive and destructive:\nAll destructive procedures cause facial numbness after relief, as well as pain relief.[41]\nPsychological and social support have been found to play a key role in the management of chronic illnesses and chronic pain conditions, such as TN. Chronic pain can cause constant frustration to individuals and those around them.[46]",

    "Disease": "Trimethylaminuria",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Trimethylamine is most noticeable in urine, as it is captured, concentrated, and released in intervals. Fishy-smelling urine is a primary identifying symptom in infant children (trimethylaminuria literally meaning \"trimethylamine in urine\").[citation needed]\nTrimethylamine is also released in a person's sweat, reproductive fluids, and breath, and can give off a fishy odor when the concentration of trimethylamine is high enough to be detected. The intensity of the smell is directly correlated with the concentration of trimethylamine in the bloodstream.[citation needed]\nPeople with TMAU may have an intermittent fish-like body odor, depending on diet and the severity of their FM03 mutation. In a 2011 study by Wise and colleagues of 115 positively identified TMAU subjects,[5] after a choline challenge load test (intentionally ingesting a TMA precursor), only 10% expressed a smell at a social distance. In a fasted state (12 hours), 0% had a smell detectable at a social distance, and only 5% had some minor malodour at an intimate distance. These findings suggested that those who produced an odour had a more severe form of FMO3 impairment. [citation needed]\nSmell events are often sporadic and episodic in nature (based on diet over the previous 24 hours), making it often difficult to diagnose by smell alone. Some people with trimethylaminuria report having a strong odor all the time, but there has not been any evidence apart from self-reported symptoms that this is the case.[citation needed]\nIndividuals with this condition do not have any physical symptoms, and they typically appear healthy.[6]\nFor unknown reasons, the condition seems more common in women than in men. Scientists suspect that such female sex hormones as progesterone and estrogen aggravate the condition. According to several reports, the condition worsens around puberty. In women, symptoms may worsen just before and during menstrual periods, after taking oral contraceptives, and around menopause.[6]",
    "Diagnosis": "Measurement of urine for the ratio of trimethylamine to trimethylamine N-oxide is the standard screening test. A blood test is available to provide genetic analysis. The prominent enzyme responsible for TMA N-oxygenation is coded by the FMO3 gene.[citation needed]\nFalse positives can occur in the following conditions, where elevated TMA can be present in the urine without any underlying TMAU:\nA similar foul-smelling odor of the urine has also been associated with colonization of the urinary tract with a bacterium called Aerococcus urinae, especially in children.[20][21]\nConsumption of certain Brassica vegetables, in particular brussels sprouts, due to dietary indoles reducing FMO3 activity - research found that a diet including 300g of brussels sprouts per day for 3 weeks temporarily reduced FMO3 capability from 90%+ to ~70%. No odour was reported on any of the participants.[22] This may result in minor secondary TMAU result.\nOlfactory reference syndrome is a condition where there is a persistent false belief and preoccupation with the idea of emitting an abnormal body odor. According to McNiven[23] at a Canadian genetics clinic, 83% of referrals for genetic testing for TMAU were deemed likely to instead have ORS. Findings found that the use of \"fecal/sewage\" as a description, and the use of multiple descriptors of the smell, and 'incorrect' locations of smell origin effectively differentiated ORS from TMAU. In the literature on body odour identification, emphasis is frequently placed on multiple consultations to reduce the risk of misdiagnosis, and also asking the individual to have a reliable confidant accompany them to the consultation who can confirm the reality of the reported symptom. ORS patients are unable to provide such confidants as they have no objective odor.[24][25]\nUnrelated fecal smells are an often misinterpreted self reported symptom associated with TMAU,[23] Cashman JR[26] found that 53% of TMAU and 59% of non-TMAU subjects suffered from regular halitosis, caused by dental plaque on the back of the tongue, which produced on average \"200-600 ppb of sulfurous/fecal smelling volatile sulfur compounds (i.e., VSC: hydrogen sulfide; methylmercaptan; dimethylsulfide) with each exhalation, creating a 'malodorous cloud' in their vicinity\". It is possible that other causes such as halitosis, haemorrhoids, regular bromhidrosis, ORS or in severe cases, a bowel obstruction leading to fecal vomiting may be the cause of fecal smells.[citation needed]\nThere is the possibility that someone may suffer from both Trimethylaminuria and ORS-like paranoia, due to the potential lack of ability to smell the odour oneself and the worry that it generates. It is recommended to organise reliable confidants, colleagues, friends or relatives (\"odor buddies\"[27]) to work with the sufferer to discreetly inform them if they are presenting an odour.\nAffected individuals experience shame and embarrassment, fail to maintain relationships, avoid contact with people who comment on their condition, and are obsessive about masking the odour with hygiene products and even smoking. The malodorous aspect can have serious and destructive effects on schooling, personal life, career and relationships, resulting in social isolation, low self-esteem, depression, paranoid behaviour, and suicide. Delayed diagnosis, body odour and the lack of cure may lead to psychosocial issues. When the condition is suspected or known to occur in a family, genetic testing can be helpful in identifying the specific individuals who have or carry the disorder.[28]\nThe metabolic and clinical manifestations of TMAU are generally regarded as benign, as there is no associated organ dysfunction. This designation, and the fact that the condition is often unrecognised by doctors, misdiagnosed and can have important ramifications including missed or delayed diagnosis.[28]",
    "Treatment": "There is no known permanent cure for primary trimethylaminuria, but symptoms can in most cases be managed via diet,[29] and sometimes by certain supplements (as below).[medical citation needed]\nDiet and supplement use should be overseen by medical professionals and nutritionists, as dietary restrictions can have other serious adverse health effects. Choline in particular is an essential nutrient required for proper neural formation in foetal and childhood development, if pregnant or breast-feeding a low choline diet should be avoided.[citation needed]\nWays of reducing the fishy odor may include:\nAdditionally, at least one study[36] has suggested that daily intake of the supplements activated charcoal and copper chlorophyllin may temporarily improve the quality of life of individuals afflicted with TMAU by helping their bodies to oxidize and convert TMA to the odorless N-oxide (TMAO) metabolite. Study participants experienced subjective reduction in odor as well as objective reduction in TMA and increase in TMAO concentration measured in their urine. The study found that:[citation needed]",
    "Society and culture": "In 2014, singer/songwriter Cassie Graves was first featured in the Daily Mail, the Daily Mirror, and The Metro UK newspapers in both print and Online,[48] giving an interview about her experiences with Trimethylaminuria. The article was later repurposed in media across the globe, most notably by HuffPost.[49]\nThe condition featured as a minor storyline in an episode of the hit U.K. drama Doc Martin series two, episode 4. [50]\nIn Alexander Payne’s 2023 movie The Holdovers, the central character Paul Hunham (played by Paul Giamatti), has the condition.[51]"

    "Disease": "Tuber cinereum hamartoma",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The classic presentation is gelastic or laughing epilepsy, a disorder characterized by spells of involuntary laughter with interval irritability and depressed mood. The tumor can be associated with other seizure types as well as precocious puberty and behavioral disorders. Gelastic epilepsy has been more classically associated with sessile lesions and precocious puberty reported with pedunculated morphology. More recent epidemiologic studies have found these associations to be less consistent, with gelastic epilepsy predominant in the majority of patients regardless of morphology.[citation needed]\nHypothalamic hamartomas are found in 33% of patients with true precocious puberty.[2] The etiology of this relationship is unclear, but it is suspected in some cases to be due to a nonphysiological secretion of GnRH.[3][4] A case of hamartoma has also been reported to secrete CRH, causing excessive ACTH production.[5]\nSeizures often begin when patients are young, although studies have shown adult onset as well. Many causes of the epilepsy have been theorized, with EEG often finding the hamartoma itself as the source of electrical activity, or epileptogenic focus. With chronic seizures, cognitive decline can develop, which can manifest as poor school performance, decreased nervous stimulus IQ, or limited socialization. Other symptoms of this tumor type include visual disturbances, such as the appearance of motion from a stationary object, or inappropriate color perception of the entire visual field.[6]\nTuber cinereum hamartoma may be associated with Pallister–Hall syndrome, a diagnosis characterized by multiple malformations, including polydactyly and imperforate anus. Neurologic symptoms are less severe in Pallister-Hall than in isolated cases of hamartoma.[1]",
    "Diagnosis": "The tumor is difficult to detect by CT due to decreased sensitivity of the scan at the level of the sella turcica. MRI is the primary imaging modality for detection, with the lesion being of similar signal intensity to gray matter and non-enhancing with contrast. Lack of enhancement is an important imaging characteristic to help distinguish the tumor from similar masses that can occur in this region. These include germ cell tumors, granulomas of Langerhans cell histiocytosis and hypothalamic astrocytomas, as these lesions usually demonstrate at least partial uptake of contrast.[1]",
    "Treatment": "Hormonal suppressive therapy with luteinizing hormone receptor agonists like leuprorelin can be used to treat the seizure component, and are effective in most patients.[7]\nSurgery is offered if there is failure of medical therapy or rapid growth of lesion, with specific options including stereotactic thermocoagulation, gamma knife radiosurgery, and physical resection by transsphenoidal microsurgery. Surgical response is typically better when the seizure focus has been found by EEG to originate in or near the mass. The specific location of the lesion relative to the pituitary and infundibulum and the amount of hormonal disturbance at presentation can help predict risk of hypopituitarism following surgery.[8]",
    "Society and culture": "In the TV series Prison Break, Sara Tancredi tells Michael Scofield that he suffers from Tuber cinereum hamartoma at the end of the tenth episode of season 4.[citation needed]\nMentioned in Royal Pains (season five), an adult patient is diagnosed with it after describing what he calls \"church giggles\" and early puberty.[citation needed]\nIn the medical drama Grey's Anatomy (\"Put Me In, Coach\"), a patient with an \"HH tumor\" comes to Dr. Derek Shepherd.[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "Tuberous sclerosis",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The physical manifestations of TSC are due to the formation of hamartia (malformed tissue such as the cortical tubers), hamartomas (benign growths such as facial angiofibroma and subependymal nodules), and very rarely, cancerous hamartoblastomas. The effect of these on the brain leads to neurological symptoms such as seizures, intellectual disability, developmental delay, and behavioral problems.[citation needed]\nThree types of brain tumours are associated with TSC:[citation needed]\nClassic intracranial manifestations of TSC include subependymal nodules and cortical/subcortical tubers.[6]\nThe tubers are typically triangular in configuration, with the apex pointed towards the ventricles, and are thought to represent foci of abnormal neuronal migration. The T2 signal abnormalities may subside in adulthood, but will still be visible on histopathological analysis. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), TSC patients can exhibit other signs consistent with abnormal neuron migration such as radial white matter tracts hyperintense on T2WI and heterotopic grey matter.[citation needed]\nSubependymal nodules are composed of abnormal, swollen glial cells and bizarre multinucleated cells which are indeterminate for glial or neuronal origin. Interposed neural tissue is not present. These nodules have a tendency to calcify as the patient ages. A nodule that markedly enhances and enlarges over time should be considered suspicious for transformation into a subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, which typically develops in the region of the foramen of Monro, in which case it is at risk of developing an obstructive hydrocephalus.\nA variable degree of ventricular enlargement is seen, either obstructive (e.g. by a subependymal nodule in the region of the foramen of Monro) or idiopathic in nature.[citation needed]\nAbout 90% of people with TSC develop a range of neurodevelopmental, behavioural, psychiatric, and psychosocial difficulties. The \"TSC‐associated neuropsychiatric disorders\" are abbreviated TAND. These difficulties are less frequently identified and thus undertreated when compared with the neurological symptoms.[7] Most problems are associated with more severe intellectual delay or associated with childhood and adolescence, and some (for example depressed mood) may be unreported if the person is unable to communicate. TAND can be investigated and considered at six levels: behavioural, psychiatric, intellectual, academic, neuropsychological, and psychosocial.[7]\nBehavioural problems most commonly seen include overactivity, impulsivity and sleeping difficulties. Also common are anxiety, mood swings, and severe aggression. Less common are depressed mood, self-injury, and compulsive behaviours.[7]\nPeople with TSC are frequently also diagnosed with psychiatric disorders: autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety disorder and depressive disorder. TSC is one of the most common genetic causes of autism spectrum disorder, which affects nearly half of people with TSC. ASD is more common in TSC2 than TSC1 and more common with earlier and more severe epilepsy, and with lower intellectual ability. ADHD is nearly as frequently seen in TSC as ASD (up to half of all people with TSC). Anxiety and depressive disorders, when they occur, are typically diagnosed in early adulthood and among those intellectually able to express their moods.[7]\nThe intellectual ability of people with TSC varies enormously. About 40–50% have a normal IQ. A normal IQ is much more commonly seen in TSC1 than TSC2, and profound intellectual disability seen in 34% of TSC2 compared with 10% of TSC1 in one study. Many studies have examined whether early onset, type and severity of epilepsy associates with intellectual ability. Academic issues occur even in people with TSC who have normal intellectual ability. These are often specific learning disorders such as dyscalculia (understanding mathematics), but also include other aspects affecting school life such as anxiety, lack of social skills or low self-esteem.[7]\nAbout half of people with TSC, when assessed for neuropsychological skills, are in the bottom 5th percentile in some areas, which indicates a severe impairment. These include problems with attention (for example, being able to concentrate on two separate things like looking and listening), memory (particularly recall, verbal and spatial working memory) and executive function (for example, planning, self-monitoring, cognitive flexibility).[7]\nThe psychosocial impacts of TSC include low self-esteem and self-efficacy in the individual, and a burden on the family coping with a complex and unpredictable disorder.[7]\nBetween 26% and 80% of TSC patients have benign tumors of the kidneys called angiomyolipomas, with hematuria being the most frequent presenting symptom.[8]  TSC angiomyolipomas differ from non-TSC angiomyolipomas in age of presentation (31.5 years vs 53.6 years), mean tumor size (8.2 cm vs 4.5 cm), and percentage of cases requiring surgical intervention (50% vs 28%).[8]  Although benign, an angiomyolipoma larger than 4 cm is at risk for a potentially catastrophic hemorrhage, either spontaneously or with minimal trauma.[citation needed]\nPatients with TSC can develop progressive replacement of the lung parenchyma with multiple cysts, known as lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). Recent genetic analysis has shown that the proliferative bronchiolar smooth muscle in TSC-related lymphangioleiomyomatosis is monoclonal metastasis from a coexisting renal angiomyolipoma. Cases of TSC-related lymphangioleiomyomatosis recurring following lung transplant have been reported.[9]\nSmall tumours of the heart muscle, called cardiac rhabdomyomas, are rare in the general population (perhaps 0.2% of children) but very common in people with TSC. Around 80% of children under two-years-old with TSC have at least one rhabdomyoma, and about 90% of those will have several. The vast majority of children with at least one rhabdomyoma, and nearly all children with multiple rhabdomyomas will be found to have TSC. Prenatal ultrasound, performed by an obstetric sonographer specializing in cardiology, can detect a rhabdomyoma after 20 weeks. Rhabdomyoma vary in size from a few millimetres to several centimetres, and are usually found in the lower chambers (ventricles) and less often in the upper chambers (atria). They grow in size during the second half of pregnancy, but regress after birth, and are seen in only around 20% of children over two years old.[10]\nMost rhabdomyomas cause no problems but some may cause heart failure in the foetus or first year of life. Rhabdomyomas are believed to be responsible for the development of heart arrhythmia later in life, which is relatively common in TSC. Arrhythmia can be hard to spot in people with TSC, other than by performing routine ECG. For example, arrhythmia may cause fainting that is confused with drop seizures, and symptoms of arrhythmia such as palpitations may not be reported in an individual with developmental delay.[10]\nSome form of dermatological sign is present in 96% of individuals with TSC. Most cause no problems, but are helpful in diagnosis. Some cases may cause disfigurement, necessitating treatment. The most common skin abnormalities include:\nRetinal lesions, called astrocytic hamartomas (or \"phakomas\"), which appear as a greyish or yellowish-white lesion in the back of the globe on the ophthalmic examination. Astrocytic hamartomas can calcify, and they are in the differential diagnosis of a calcified globe mass on a CT scan.[13]\nNonretinal lesions associated with TSC include:\nPancreatic neuroendocrine tumours have been described in rare cases of TSC.[14]\nIndividuals with TSC may experience none or all of the clinical signs discussed above. The following table shows the prevalence of some of the clinical signs in individuals diagnosed with TSC.",
    "Diagnosis": "Tuberous sclerosis complex is diagnosed with clinical and genetic tests. There are many different mutations in the TSC1 and TSC2 genes that have been identified in individuals with TSC. A pathogenic mutation in the gene prevents the proteins from being made or inactivates the proteins. If such a pathogenic mutation is found then this alone is sufficient to diagnose TSC. However, some mutations are less clear in their effect, and so not sufficient alone for diagnosis. Between 1 in 10 and 1 in 4 of individuals with TSC have no mutation that can be identified. Once a particular mutation is identified in someone with TSC, this mutation can be used to make confident diagnoses in other family members.[11]\nFor clinical diagnosis, there isn't one sign that is unique (pathognomonic) to TSC, nor are all signs seen in all individuals. Therefore, several signs are considered together, classed as either major or minor features. An individual with two major features, or one major feature and at least two minor features can be given a definite diagnosis of TSC. If only one major feature or at least two minor features are present, the diagnosis is only regarded as possibly TSC.[11]\nTSC can be first diagnosed at any stage of life. Prenatal diagnosis is possible by chance if heart tumours are discovered during routine ultrasound. In infancy, epilepsy, particularly infantile spasms, or developmental delay may lead to neurological tests. The white patches on the skin may also first become noticed. In childhood, behavioural problems and autism spectrum disorder may provoke a diagnosis. During adolescence, the skin problems appear. In adulthood, kidney and lung problems may develop. An individual may also be diagnosed at any time as a result of genetic testing of family members of another affected person.[24]",
    "Treatment": "Tuberous sclerosis complex affects multiple organ systems so a multidisciplinary team of medical professionals is required.[citation needed]\nIn suspected or newly diagnosed TSC, the following tests and procedures are recommended by 2012 International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus Conference.[25]\nThe various symptoms and complications from TSC may appear throughout life, requiring continued surveillance and adjustment to treatments. The following ongoing tests and procedures are recommended by 2012 International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus Conference.[25]\nThe mTOR inhibitor everolimus was approved in the US for treatment of TSC-related tumors in the brain (subependymal giant cell astrocytoma) in 2010 and in the kidneys (renal angiomyolipoma) in 2012.[26][27]  Oral everolimus (rapalog) reduces tumour size, is effective in terms of response to skin lesions and does not increase the risk of adverse events.[28] Everolimus also showed evidence of effectiveness at treating epilepsy in some people with TSC.[29][30] In 2017, the European Commission approved everolimus for treatment of refractory partial-onset seizures associated with TSC.[31]\nNeurosurgical intervention may reduce the severity and frequency of seizures in TSC patients.[32][33] Embolization and other surgical interventions can be used to treat renal angiomyolipoma with acute hemorrhage. Surgical treatments for symptoms of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) in adult TSC patients include pleurodesis to prevent pneumothorax and lung transplantation in the case of irreversible lung failure.[25]\nOther treatments that have been used to treat TSC manifestations and symptoms include a ketogenic diet for intractable epilepsy and pulmonary rehabilitation for LAM.[34] Facial angiofibromas can be reduced with laser treatment and the effectiveness of mTOR inhibitor topical treatment is being investigated. Laser therapy is painful, requires anaesthesia, and has risks of scarring and dyspigmentation.[35]",
    "Prognosis": "The prognosis for individuals with TSC depends on the severity of symptoms, which range from mild skin abnormalities to varying degrees of learning disabilities and epilepsy to severe intellectual disability, uncontrollable seizures, and kidney failure. Those individuals with mild symptoms generally do well and live long, productive lives, while individuals with the more severe form may have serious disabilities. However, with appropriate medical care, most individuals with the disorder can look forward to normal life expectancy.[4]\nA study of 30 TSC patients in Egypt found, \"...earlier age of seizures commencement (<6 months) is associated with poor seizure outcome and poor intellectual capabilities. Infantile spasms and severely epileptogenic EEG patterns are related to the poor seizure outcome, poor intellectual capabilities and autistic behavior. Higher tubers numbers is associated with poor seizure outcome and autistic behavior. Left-sided tuber burden is associated with poor intellect, while frontal location is more encountered in ASD [autism spectrum disorders]. So, close follow up for the mental development and early control of seizures are recommended in a trial to reduce the risk factors of poor outcome. Also early diagnosis of autism will allow for earlier treatment and the potential for better outcome for children with TSC.\"[36]\nLeading causes of death include renal disease, brain tumour, lymphangioleiomyomatosis of the lung, and status epilepticus or bronchopneumonia in those with severe intellectual disability.[37] Cardiac failure due to rhabdomyomas is a risk in the fetus or neonate but is rarely a problem subsequently. Kidney complications such as angiomyolipoma and cysts are common and more frequent in females than males and in TSC2 than TSC1. Renal cell carcinoma is uncommon. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis  is only a risk for females with angiomyolipomas.[38] In the brain, the subependymal nodules occasionally degenerate to subependymal giant cell astrocytomas. These may block the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid around the brain, leading to hydrocephalus.[citation needed]\nDetection of the disease should be followed by genetic counselling. It is also important to realize that though the disease does not have a cure, symptoms can be treated symptomatically. Hence, awareness regarding different organ manifestations of TSC is important.[39]",
    "Epidemiology": "TSC occurs in all races and ethnic groups, and in both sexes. The live-birth prevalence is estimated to be between 10 and 16 cases per 100,000. A 1998 study[2] estimated total population prevalence between about 7 and 12 cases per 100,000, with more than half of these cases undetected. Prior to the invention of CT scanning to identify the nodules and tubers in the brain, the prevalence was thought to be much lower, and the disease associated with those people diagnosed clinically with learning disability, seizures and facial angiofibroma. Whilst still regarded as a rare disease, TSC is common when compared to many other genetic diseases, with at least 1 million individuals affected worldwide.[15]"

  {
    "Disease": "Tyrosinemia type I",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Type 1 tyrosinemia typically presents in infancy as failure to thrive and hepatomegaly.  The primary effects are progressive liver and kidney dysfunction.  The liver disease causes cirrhosis, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, elevated AFP, hypoglycemia and coagulation abnormalities.  This can lead to jaundice, ascites and hemorrhage.  There is also an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.[citation needed]The kidney dysfunction presents as Fanconi syndrome: Renal tubular acidosis, hypophosphatemia and aminoaciduria.  Cardiomyopathy, neurologic and dermatologic manifestations are also possible. The urine has an odor of cabbage or rancid butter.[4]\nThe presentation of symptoms of tyrosinemia type 1 in terms of timing is broken into three categories: acute, sub-acute, and chronic.[citation needed]\nThe acute classification typically is presented clinically between birth and 6 months of age. The common presentation in an acute case is synthetic liver failure, marked by the lack of formation of coagulation factors in blood. Patients are prone to infections at this stage accompanied by fever, vomiting, increased tendency to bleed, and diarrhea along with bloody feces as manifestations of sepsis. Other symptoms include enlarged liver, jaundice, and excess abdominal fluid.[1][2]\nSub-acute cases present between 6 months and the first year of life and the severity of liver disease is lessened to an extent. Again, synthetic function of the liver in terms of blood coagulation factors is impaired in addition to enlargement of the liver and spleen. The infant may also display a failure to thrive as their growth is limited by the disease. This growth impairment can manifest itself in rickets, which is the softening of bones.[1][2]\nThe final classification, chronic HT1, is detected with presentations occurring after one year of life. The course of the disease up to this point can lead to different ailments affecting the liver. Cirrhosis, liver failure, or cancer of the liver may present as a result of chronic liver disease. Additional symptoms common in this classification include cardiomyopathy, renal disease, and acute neurological crises.[1][2]\nThe liver is the organ affected most by Tyrosinemia Type I due to the high level of expression of the gene for fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) in liver cells. The production of blood coagulation factors by the liver is disrupted, causing hemophiliac-like symptoms. Acute liver failure is common, especially in early life. Additionally, the synthesis of albumin in the liver may be defective, therefore leading to hypoalbuminemia. As the disease progresses, cirrhosis is common. This can lead to a fatty liver and the development of tumors in areas affected by this scarring of liver tissue. These scars are known as nodules.[2] There is a 37% chance of developing a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for untreated patients.[5]\nMany patients display impaired kidney function and neurological symptoms. In addition to liver cells, kidney cell expression involves expression of the gene for FAH. Kidney failure is a potential result of impaired kidney function, but the most common symptom associated with renal dysfunction is hypophosphatemic rickets.[2] Neurological manifestations are characterized by acute neurological crises due to overaccumulation of porphyrin. These crises are characterized by porphyria. They typically follow an infection. Patients can present with a variety of varied symptoms including paresthesias, abdominal pain, pain-induced seizures, and can result in self-mutilation in response to this pain. Episodes can last for 1–7 days and can lead to neuropathy.[1][2]",
    "Diagnosis": "Beyond the identification of physical clinical symptoms outlined above, the definitive criterion for diagnostic assessment of Tyrosinemia Type I is elevated succinylacetone (SA) in blood and urine. Elevated SA levels are not associated with any other known medical condition, so there is minimal risk of misdiagnosis.[5] Quantitation of tyrosine levels is also used as a diagnostic but is less reliable due to high false positive and false negative rates.[9] Newborns are not generally screened for HT1 due to rarity of the condition and lack of apparent symptoms at time of birth.[1] However, prompt assessment upon the manifestation of physical symptoms such as fever, vomiting, increased tendency to bleed, diarrhea along with bloody feces, and jaundice is critical for improving long term prognosis.[1][2]",
    "Treatment": "The primary treatment for type 1 tyrosinemia is nitisinone and restriction of tyrosine in the diet.[6] Nitisinone inhibits the conversion of 4-OH phenylpyruvate to homogentisic acid by 4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, the second step in tyrosine degradation.  By inhibiting this enzyme, the accumulation of the fumarylacetoacetate is prevented.[10] Previously, liver transplantation was the primary treatment option and is still used in patients in whom nitisinone fails.[citation needed]\nClinical treatment of HT1 relies on medications and strict regulation of diet. Nitisinone and dietary restrictions that decrease the amount of tyrosine and phenylalaine absorbed from the GI tract during protein digestion are used in combination as therapeutic measures that control the disease state if they are continued indefinitely. If not, there is a lack of control over the disease, resulting in continued liver and kidney damage, contributing to organ failure and death. In this case, a liver transplant may be required.[2] Levels of SA are monitored throughout treatment in order to assess treatment effectiveness.[9]\nThe prescribed diet for treatment of HT1 is low in protein. Patients received amino acid supplements lacking tyrosine and phenylalanine, most often by drinking a specially engineered formula, in order to acquire sufficient protein. It is recommended that tyrosine levels remain below 500 μmol/L.[5] Phenylalnine is the precursor to tyrosine. The ideology behind maintaining low tyrosine levels is two-fold. Firstly, it prevents the toxic metabolic intermediates from accumulating as a result of the dysfunctional tyrosine metabolic pathway. Prior to the introduction of nitisinone, this was the main treatment measure. Secondly, the mechanism of action of nitisinone is prevention of any tyrosine metabolism, thus it is important to prevent tyrosine from accumulating. Dietary protein consumption while taking nitisinone can also lead to side effects affecting the ocular system, which are easily reversed by removing protein from the diet.[9]\nNitisinone is prescribed ultimately to reduce the accumulation of toxic metabolic intermediates, such as succinylacetate, which are toxic to cells. It modifies the function of 4-hydrooxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase by acting as a competitive inhibitor. 4-hydrooxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase functions to convert 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate to homogentisate as the second enzymatic reaction in the tyrosine catabolic pathway. This prevents the further catabolism of tyrosine.[5] It is recommended that nitisinone treatment begins immediately following a confirmed or suspected case of HT1.[1] It is supplied orally as a capsule or suspension in dose increments of 2 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, or 20 mg or 4 mg/mL respectively.[5] The starting dose is 1 mg/kg one time daily or 2 mg/kg one time daily for 48 hours if the patient is experiencing acute liver failure. Patient responsiveness to nitisinone is assessed by measuring blood coagulation activity and SA levels in blood and urine. Patients should display a positive response within 24–48 hours of first dose. Establishment of the long-term dosage will vary from patient to patient. It is recommended that nitisinone levels be maintained at 30-50 μM in the blood stream.[1]",
    "Prognosis": "Prior to the development of nitisinone, dietary restrictions and liver transplantation were the only forms of treatment for HT1.[2] A study regarding the efficacy of treatment with nitisinone and dietary restrictions found that 93% of people survived at two years, four years, and six years indicating the prognosis of stabilizing the HT1 disease state is positive.[5]",
    "Epidemiology": "Tyrosinemia type I affects males and females in equal numbers. Its prevalence has been estimated to be 1 in 100,000 to 120,000 births worldwide. HT1 is especially prevalent in the Saguenay-Lac Saint-Jean region of Quebec is one in 1,850 births. The elevated frequency of this disorder within individuals of French-Canadian ancestry in Quebec is believed to be due to reduced genetic heterogeneity within the original founder population for the Saguenay-Lac Saint-Jean region.[11] The initial settlement of Saguenay Lac-Saint-Jean (SLSJ) occurred between 1838 and 1911. From a total of 28,656 settlers, 75 percent originated from the neighboring Charlevoix region. The settling of the Charlevoix region itself started in 1675 when 599 founders of mostly French descent moved to this region from the Quebec City area.[citation needed]\nWorldwide, type I tyrosinemia affects about 1 person in 100,000. This type of tyrosinemia is much more common in Quebec, Canada. The overall incidence in Quebec is about 1 in 16,000 individuals. In the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region of Quebec, type 1 tyrosinemia affects 1 person in 1,846.[12] The carrier rate has been estimated to be between 1 in 20 and 1 in 31.[13]"

    "Signs and symptoms": "Infants may exhibit severe cyanosis and right heart failure at birth, though these conditions may get better as pulmonary vascular resistance decreases. The main clinical features in older patients are right heart failure symptoms and signs.[6]",
    "Causes": "Although the precise cause of Uhl's anomaly is unknown, there have been reports of primary nondevelopment of myocytes, selective apoptosis, and cardiomyocyte overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor.[7][8] A sporadic mutation could indicate that genetics is the underlying cause.[9]",
    "Diagnosis": "Myocardial biopsies can confirm the diagnosis, which is often established by imaging tests like cardiac magnetic resonance imaging or echocardiogram.[10]\nRight atrial and right ventricular dilatation is the cause of the cardiomegaly seen on the chest radiograph. The lung fields of newborns with functional pulmonary atresia and high pulmonary vascular resistance appear oligaemic.[6]\nRight ventricular and right atrial dilatation is evident on the electrocardiogram. One can observe an epsilon (ε) wave in the right praecordial leads.[6]\nAn echocardiographic evaluation reveals a thin free wall of the right ventricle without any myocardium, reduced contractility and restricted ventricle filling, dilation of the right atrium, and normal tricuspid valve attachment to the right atrioventricular junction.[6]\nGlobal dyskinesia of a thin-walled right ventricle, absence of myocardium at the right ventricular free wall, lack of fibrofatty infiltration, normal tricuspid valve attachment to the right atrioventricular junction, and normal left ventricular myocardium are all indicative of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging findings.[6]\nHistopathologically, nonfunctioning fibroelastic tissue replaces the myocardial layer, giving the right ventricular free wall a parchment-like appearance.[11]\nOther anomalies that can result in RV dilatation, such as Ebstein anomaly, RV arrhythmogenic dysplasia, pulmonary atresia, and anomalous pulmonary venous return, are included in the differential diagnosis of Uhl anomaly.[12]",
    "Treatment": "When the pulmonary vascular resistance has become high and the newborn has severe cyanosis soon after birth, a brief intravenous prostaglandin E infusion is recommended. In most cases, diuretics are necessary for congestive right heart failure. Various surgical techniques have been used, such as: (1) one-and-a-half ventricular repair alongside partial right ventriculectomy and bidirectional Glenn shunt; (2) right ventricular exclusion alongside atrial septectomy as well as a bidirectional Glenn shunt (superior cavopulmonary anastomosis); and (3) cardiac transplantation.[6]"

In the differential diagnosis of UCDM, even in patients without finger contractures, Bethlem myopathy could be considered.[13]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment for Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy can consist of physical therapy and regular stretching to prevent and reduce contractures. Respiratory support may be needed at some point by the affected individual.[3]\nThough cardiac complications are not a concern in this type of CMD, in regards to respiratory issues ventilation via a tracheostomy is a possibility in some cases.[6][14]",

Surgery, at some point, might be an option for scoliosis.[3]\nScoliosis, which is a sideways curve of the persons vertebrate, is determined by a variety of factors, including the degree (mild or severe), in which case if possible a brace might be used by the individual.[15]"

    "Disease": "Unverricht%E2%80%93Lundborg disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Patients with Unverricht–Lundborg disease exhibit myoclonic jerks and tonic-clonic seizures at a young age, between ages 6–16. The myoclonic jerks occur in the muscles of the arms and legs closest to the torso, and are triggered due to a variety of common external stimuli.[7] Seizures begin at an average age of 10.8 years, with myoclonus beginning around 12.1 years.[8] It is not currently possible to diagnose without a genetic test, and since early symptoms are general, it is often mistaken for another more common epilepsy, in many cases juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME).[7] These episodes of myoclonus may be caused by physical exertion, stress, light, or other stimuli. Within 5-10 years, these episodes may increase in severity to the point that they interfere with everyday activities such as walking. Individuals with Unverricht-Lundborg disease also often experience seizures involving muscle rigidity, convulsions, and loss of consciousness; these may also increase in frequency as the disease progresses but may be controlled with treatment. After several years, these seizures may stabilize or decrease in frequency. Eventually, people with Unverricht-Lundborg disease may develop ataxia, intention tremor, dysarthria, depression, and a slow, mild decline in intellectual functioning.[9]",
    "Causes": "The genetic cause of ULD is known, but research has led to new areas of study that may lead to an increase in knowledge of what causes ULD.[citation needed]\nThe cause of ULD is known to be a mutation of the gene that produces cystatin B.[2] The disease is autosomal recessive, so both parents of an individual must be carriers of the recessive CSTB gene for the individual to inherit it, and for an individual to show symptoms of ULD, they must have both recessive CSTB genes.[2] Siblings of affected individuals who only have one recessive gene have been monitored and generally do not show the signs of ULD, though in some cases mild symptoms may be present.[10]\nNew research shows that cystatin B may not be the only factor involved in Unverricht–Lundborg disease. In a study, it was determined that patients with ULD had more dopamine receptors in certain areas of their brain than unaffected individuals.[11] The researchers chose to investigate dopamine receptors because they are known to be a factor in myoclonus, which are a significant part of the symptoms of ULD. The results of this study indicate that the cause of ULD may be more complex than currently thought.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "The only currently available method to diagnose Unverricht–Lundborg disease is a genetic test to check for the presence of the mutated cystatin B gene. If this gene is present in an individual suspected of having the disease, it can be confirmed. However, genetic tests of this type are prohibitively expensive to perform, especially due to the rarity of ULD.[13] The early symptoms of ULD are general and in many cases similar to other more common epilepsies, such as juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.[7] For these reasons, ULD is generally one of the last options doctors explore when looking to diagnose patients exhibiting its symptoms. In most cases, a misdiagnosis is not detrimental to the patient, because many of the same medications are used to treat both ULD and whatever type of epilepsy the patient has been misdiagnosed with. However, there are a few epilepsy medications that increase the incidence of seizures and myoclonic jerks in patients with ULD, which can lead to an increase in the speed of progression, including phenytoin, fosphenytoin, sodium channel blockers, GABAergic drugs, gabapentin and pregabalin.[7]\nOther methods to diagnose Unverricht–Lundborg disease are currently being explored. While electroencephalogram (EEG) is useful in identifying or diagnosing other forms of epilepsy, the location of seizures in ULD is currently known to be generalized across the entire brain. Without a specific region to pinpoint, it is difficult to accurately distinguish an EEG reading from an individual with ULD from an individual with another type of epilepsy characterized by generalized brain seizures. However, with recent research linking ULD brain damage to the hippocampus,[12] the usefulness of EEG as a diagnostic tool may increase.\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is also often used during diagnosis of patients with epilepsy. While MRIs taken during the onset of the disease are generally similar to those of individuals without ULD, MRIs taken once the disease has progressed show characteristic damage[7]\nWhile ULD is a rare disease, the lack of well defined cases to study and the difficulty in confirming diagnosis provide strong evidence that this disease is likely under diagnosed.[2]\nUnverricht–Lundborg disease is also known as EPM1, as it is a form of progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME). Other progressive myoclonic epilepsies include myoclonus epilepsy and ragged red fibers (MERRF syndrome),  Lafora disease (EPM2a or EMP2b), Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) and sialidosis. Progressive myoclonic epilepsies generally constitute only a small percentage of epilepsy cases seen, and ULD is the most common form. While ULD can lead to an early death, it is considered to be the least severe form of progressive myoclonic epilepsy.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "While there is no current cure to repair the mutated CSTB gene, several antiepileptic drugs are effective in reducing seizures and helping patients with ULD to manage the symptoms. In addition, new research is being performed to examine the effectiveness of other types of treatments.[citation needed]\nValproic acid is the first line drug choice for reducing generalised seizures and myoclonus. Levetiracetam is also effective for both generalised seizures and myoclonus. Clonazepam and high-dose piracetam can alleviate myoclonus. Phenytoin can worsen seizures and may speed up neurodegeneration; carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, tiagabine, vigabatrin, gabapentin and pregabalin may worsen myoclonus and myoclonic seizures.[14] Other common medications to treat ULD include topiramate and zonisamide. If an individual with Unverricht–Lundborg disease is particularly sensitive to a certain type of stimulus, it is also beneficial to reduce the patient's exposure to that stimulus in order to reduce the likelihood of seizures.[7] Since ULD is progressive and may not get better over time, depression has been documented in many cases, so providing a strong support group of friends, family, and even other individuals with ULD is very beneficial.[8]",
    "Prognosis": "For early Unverricht–Lundborg disease patients, the disease would begin to progress early and lack of effective treatment meant a quick progression. In many cases the patient would require a wheelchair for mobility, and would die at a young age.[8]\nHowever, increased knowledge about the disease and improved treatment and medication has led to a dramatic improvement in prognosis for individuals with ULD. Antiepileptic drugs reduce the occurrence of seizures and myoclonus, which leads to a decrease in the damage caused in the brain due to seizures and the body due to falls resulting from the seizures. As a result, individuals with Unverricht–Lundborg disease are now much less likely to end up in a wheelchair, which eliminates the chance of complications involved with being a wheelchair user.[13] All these factors have increased the outlook for patients. Due to the progressive nature of the disease, depression is prevalent,[8] but support of family and friends as well as proper treatment can help. While early patients with ULD had a life expectancy of around 24 years,[8] there have recently been reported cases of individuals living to near-normal ages.[7]",
    "Epidemiology": "The only country that Unverricht–Lundborg disease has a reported incidence is in Finland, where it is reported to occur in 4 in 100,000 individuals.[7] However, ULD has only become well defined recently, and it is likely still under diagnosed,[2] so the actual incidence may be different that what is currently known. Other countries with known cases include countries in the Mediterranean region including Italy, France, Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco, next is Czech Republic [7] as well as the United States."

    "Disease": "Upshaw%E2%80%93Schulman syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The presentation of TTP is variable. The initial symptoms, which force the patient to medical care, are often the consequence of lower platelet counts like purpura (present in 90% of patients), ecchymosis and hematoma.[4] Patients may also report signs and symptoms as a result of (microangiopathic) hemolytic anemia, such as (dark) beer-brown urine, (mild) jaundice, fatigue and pallor. Cerebral symptoms of various degree are present in many patients, including headache, paresis, speech disorder, visual problems, seizures and disturbance of consciousness up to coma. The symptoms can fluctuate so that they may only be temporarily present but may reappear again later in the TTP episode. Other unspecific symptoms are general malaise, abdominal, joint and muscle pain. Severe manifestations of heart or lung involvements are rare, although affections are not seldom measurable (such as ECG changes).[5]",
    "Causes": "The ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 motif 13) gene is located on chromosome 9q34 and encoding 29 exons.[6] The ADAMTS13 protease consists of 1427 amino acids and has several protein domains:[1][6]\nDisease causing mutations in ADAMTS13, which can be found in all ADAMTS13 protease domains.[8] result predominantly in impaired ADAMTS13 secretion with or without decreased ADAMTS13 protease activity.[7] More than 120 disease causing mutations and numerous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) are known today.[11][12] Residual ADAMTS13 activity has been observed with certain mutations and seems to be associated with a later disease-onset.[11] It has been postulated that some SNPs interact with each other and may amplify or reduce overall ADAMTS13 activity.[6][7]\nThe ADAMTS protease family contains enzymes that process collagen, cleave inter-cellular matrix, inhibit angiogenesis and blood coagulation. ADAMTS13 belongs to the zinc metalloproteases, and is mainly expressed in liver stellate cells and endothelial cells, but was also found in other cell types, such as platelets, podocytes in the kidney and several brain cells.[8][13][14] The only known role of the ADAMTS13 protease is to cleave vWF multimers.[15] The plasma half-life of administered ADAMTS13 in USS patients is around 2–4 days, whereas the protective effects seems to last longer.[16][17]\nUsually USS patients have a severely deficient ADAMTS13 activity of <10% of the normal.[9] In this low range there may be residual ADAMTS13 activity, depending on the underlying mutations.[6][7][11]\nIn USS severe ADAMTS13 deficiency is often not enough to induce a (first) acute TTP episode. It primarily occurs when an additional (environmental) trigger is present.[1][6][8] Recognized triggers  are infections (including mild flu-like upper airway infections), pregnancy,[18] heavy alcohol intake[16] or certain drugs.[1][9] In these situations, vWF is released from its storage organelles, such as Weibel–Palade bodies and granules of platelets. Increased vWF levels in the circulation are leading to a higher demand of ADAMTS13, which is lacking in USS, and can bring forward a TTP episode.[3][5]",
    "Diagnosis": "A diagnosis of TTP is based on the clinical symptoms with the concomitant presence of thrombocytopenia (platelet count below 100×109/L) and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with schistocytes on the blood smear, a negative direct antiglobulin test (Coombs test), elevated levels of hemolysis markers (such as total bilirubin, LDH, free hemoglobin, and an unmeasurable haptoglobin), after exclusion of any other apparent cause.[1][2]\nUSS can present similar to the following diseases, which have to be excluded: fulminant infections, disseminated intravascular coagulation, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, Evans syndrome, the typical and atypical form of hemolytic uremic syndrome, HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome, pre-eclampsia, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, cancer that is often accompanied with metastasis, kidney injury, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and side effects from hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.[1][2]\nOf note is that pregnancy associated affections like pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, and HELLP syndrome can overlap in their presentation as pregnancy can trigger TTP episodes.[19]\nPatients with fulminant infections, disseminated intravascular coagulation, HELLP syndrome, pancreatitis, liver disease, and other active inflammatory conditions may have reduced ADAMTS13 activity, but almost never a relevant severe ADAMTS13 deficiency <10% of the normal.[2][20]\nA severe ADAMTS13 deficiency below 5% or <10% of the normal (depending on the definitions)[1][21] is highly specific for the diagnosis of TTP.[16][22] ADAMTS13 activity assays are based on the direct or indirect measurement of vWF-cleavage products. Its activity should be measured in blood samples taken before therapy has started, to prevent false high ADAMTS13 activity.[2] If a severe ADAMTS13 deficiency is present an ADAMTS13 inhibitor assay is needed to distinguish between the acquired, autoantibody-mediated and the congenital form of TTP (USS).[1] The presence of antibodies can be tested by ELISA or functional inhibitor assays. The level of ADAMTS13 inhibitor may be fluctuating over the course of disease and depends on free circulatory antibodies, therefore a onetime negative test result does not always exclude the presence of ADAMTS13 inhibitors and thereby an autoimmune origin of TTP.[2] A severe ADAMTS13 deficiency in the absence of an inhibitor, confirmed on a second time point in a healthy episode of a possible USS patient, usually sets the trigger to perform a molecular analysis of the ADAMTS13 gene to confirm a mutation. In unclear cases a plasma infusion trial can be done, showing a USS in the absence of anti-ADAMTS13-antibodies a full recovery of infused plasma-ADAMTS13 activity as well as a plasma half-life of infused ADAMTS13 activity of 2–4 days. A deficiency of ADAMTS13 activity in first-degree relatives is also a very strong indicator for an Upshaw–Schulman syndrome.[1][2][9]",
    "Treatment": "The therapy of an acute TTP episode has to be started as early as possible.[1][2] The standard treatment is the daily replacement of the missing ADAMTS13 protease in form of plasma infusions or in more severe episodes by plasma exchange. In the latter the patients plasma is replaced by donated plasma.[23] The most common sources of ADAMTS13 is platelet-poor fresh frozen plasma (FFP)[3] or solvent-detergent plasma.\nThe benefit of plasma exchange compared to plasma infusions alone may result from the additional removal of ULvWF.[1][23] In general both plasma therapies are well tolerated, several mostly minor complications may be observed.[2][23] The number of infusion/exchange sessions needed to overcome a TTP episode are variable but usually take less than a week in USS.[1][9] The intensive plasma-therapy is generally stopped when platelet count increases to normal levels and is stable over several days.[1][2]\nNot all affected patients seem to need a regular preventive plasma infusion therapy, especially as some reach long-term remission without it.[24] Regular plasma infusions are necessary in patients with frequent relapses and in general situations with increased risk to develop an acute episode (as seen above) such as pregnancy. Plasma infusions are given usually every 2–3 weeks to prevent acute episodes of USS,[16] but are often individually adapted.",
    "Epidemiology": "The incidence of acute TTP in adults is around 1.7–4.5 per million and year.[28][29] These cases are nearly all due to the autoimmune form of TTP, where autoantibodies inhibit ADAMTS13 activity.[1][9] The prevalence of USS has not yet been determined, but is assumed to constitute less than 5% of all acute TTP cases. The syndrome's inheritance is autosomal recessive, and is more often caused by compound heterozygous than homozygous mutations.[30] The age of onset is variable and can be from neonatal age up to the 5th–6th decade.[1] The risk of relapses differs between affected individuals.[1][9] Minimization of the burden of disease can be reached by early diagnosis and initiation of prophylaxis if required.[2]"

    "Disease": "Urbach%E2%80%93Wiethe disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Urbach–Wiethe disease is characterized by both neurological and dermatological symptoms.[14][15]\nAlthough symptoms can vary greatly between affected individuals, even those within the same family, symptoms normally begin in infancy and are typically a result of thickening skin and mucous membranes.[2]  The first symptom is often a weak cry or a hoarse voice due to a thickening of the vocal cords.  The hoarse voice can be one of the most striking clinical manifestations of the disease.[9] Lesions and scars also appear on the skin, usually the face and the distal parts of the limbs.[6] This is often the result of poor wound healing and the scarring continues to increase as the patient ages, leaving the skin with a waxy appearance.  Skin may be easily damaged as a result of only a minor trauma or injury, leaving many blisters and additional scars.[10] The skin is also usually very dry and wrinkly.  White or yellow infiltrates form on the lips, buccal mucosa, tonsils, uvula, epiglottis and frenulum of the tongue.[6] This can lead to upper respiratory tract infection and sometimes requires tracheostomy to relieve the symptom.[9] Too much thickening of the frenulum can restrict tongue movement and may result in speech impediments.[16] Beading of the papules around the eyelids is a very common symptom and is often used as part of a diagnosis of the disease.  Some other dermatological symptoms that are sometimes seen but less common include hair loss, parotitis and other dental abnormalities, corneal ulceration, and focal degeneration of the macula.[17]\nAlthough the dermatological changes are the most obvious symptoms of Urbach–Wiethe disease, many patients also have neurological symptoms.  About 50–75%  of the diagnosed cases of Urbach–Wiethe disease also show bilateral symmetrical calcifications on the medial temporal lobes.[18] These calcifications often affect the amygdala and the periamygdaloid gyri.[11] The amygdala is thought to be involved in processing biologically relevant stimuli and in emotional long-term memory, particularly those associated with fear, and both PET and MRI scans have shown a correlation between amygdala activation and episodic memory for strongly emotional stimuli.[14]  Therefore, Urbach–Wiethe disease patients with calcifications and lesions in these regions may suffer impairments in these systems. These calcifications are the result of a buildup of calcium deposits in the blood vessels within this brain region.  Over time, these vessels harden and the tissue they are a part of dies, causing lesions.  The amount of calcification is often related to disease duration.[10] The true prevalence of these calcifications is difficult to accurately state as not all patients undergo brain imaging.  Some patients also exhibit epilepsy and neuropsychiatric abnormalities. Epilepsy symptoms could begin with light anxiety attacks and can be controlled with anti-epileptic medications.[10]  Other patients present with symptoms similar to schizophrenia while some suffer from mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders.[16][19]",
    "Causes": "Researchers have mapped Urbach–Wiethe disease to chromosome 1 at 1q21 and specifically identified the extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1) gene as the gene containing mutations that can lead to the development of the condition.[12] At this point, 41 different mutations within ECM1 have been reported to lead to Urbach–Wiethe disease.[13] These were all homozygous loss-of-function mutations (i.e. nonsense, frameshift or internal deletions).[9] It is an autosomal recessive condition,[2][13] requiring two mutated copies of the ECM1 gene to cause the disease.[20]\nECM1 codes for a glycoprotein of previously unknown origin.  The discovery that the loss of ECM1 expression leads to the symptoms associated with Urbach–Wiethe disease suggests that ECM1 may contribute to skin adhesion, epidermal differentiation, and wound healing and scarring.[12]  It is also thought to play a role in endochondral bone formation, tumor biology, endothelial cell proliferation and blood vessel formation.[9]\nThe dermatological symptoms are caused by a buildup of a hyaline material in the dermis and the thickening of the basement membranes in the skin.[9] The nature of this material is unknown, but researchers have suggested that it may be a glycoprotein, a glycolipid, an acid mucopolysaccharide, altered collagen or elastic tissue.[6]",
    "Diagnosis": "Urbach–Wiethe disease is typically diagnosed by its clinical dermatological manifestations, particularly the beaded papules on the eyelids.  Doctors can also test the hyaline material with a periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining, as the material colors strongly for this stain.[6]\nImmunohistochemical skin labeling for antibodies for the ECM1 protein as labeling has been shown to be reduced in the skin of those affected by Urbach–Wiethe disease.[13]  Staining with anti-type IV collagen antibodies or anti-type VII collagen antibodies reveals bright, thick bands at the dermoepidermal junction.[9]\nNon-contrast CT scans can image calcifications, but this is not typically used as a means of diagnosing the disease.  This is partly due to the fact that not all Urbach-Wiethe patients exhibit calcifications, but also because similar lesions can be formed from other diseases such as herpes simplex and encephalitis.  The discovery of mutations within the ECM1 gene has allowed the use of genetic testing to confirm initial clinical diagnoses of Urbach–Wiethe disease.  It also allows doctors to better distinguish between Urbach–Wiethe disease and other similar diseases not caused by mutations in ECM1.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Currently, there is no cure for Urbach–Wiethe disease although there are some ways to individually treat many of its symptoms.  There has been some success with oral dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and intralesional heparin, but this is not true in all cases.[9][19] D-penicillamine has also shown promise, but has yet to have been used extensively.[13]  There are also some reports of patients being treated with etretinate, a drug typically prescribed to treat psoriasis.[17] In some cases, calcifications in the brain can lead to abnormal electrical activity among neurons.  Some patients are given anti-seizure medication to help deal with these abnormalities.  Tracheostomy is often used to relieve upper respiratory tract infections. Carbon dioxide laser surgery of thickened vocal cords and beaded eyelid papules have improved these symptoms for patients.[9]  The discovery of the mutations of the ECM1 gene has opened the possibility of gene therapy or a recombinant EMC1 protein for Urbach–Wiethe disease treatment, but neither of these two options are currently available.[citation needed]",
    "Prognosis": "Urbach–Wiethe disease is typically not a life-threatening condition.[2] The life expectancy of these patients is normal as long as the potential side effects of thickening mucosa, such as respiratory obstruction, are properly addressed.[10] Although this may require a tracheostomy or carbon dioxide laser surgery, such steps can help ensure that individuals with Urbach–Wiethe disease are able to live a full life.  Oral dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) has been shown to reduce skin lesions, helping to minimize discomfort for these individuals.[9]",
    "Epidemiology": "Urbach–Wiethe disease is very rare; there are fewer than 300 reported cases in medical literature.[2] Although Urbach–Wiethe disease can be found worldwide, almost a quarter of reported diagnoses are in South Africa.[2] Many of these are in patients of Dutch, German, and Khoisan ancestry.[2][12] This high frequency is thought to be due to the founder effect.[13] Due to its recessive genetic cause and the ability to be a carrier of the disease without symptoms, Urbach–Wiethe disease often runs in families.  In some regions of South Africa, up to one in 12 individuals may be carriers of the disease.[9]  Most of the case studies involving Urbach–Wiethe disease patients involve only one to three cases and these cases are often in the same family.  Due to its low incidence, it is difficult to find a large enough number of cases to adequately study the disease.[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "Urofacial syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Infants with the disorder exhibit an inverted smile; they appear to be crying when they are actually smiling, in conjunction with uropathy. They also may be affected by hydronephrosis. Symptoms of this disease can start at very young ages. Many people with this syndrome will die in their teens to early 20s because of the renal failure (uropathy) if not diagnosed and treated. Children with the syndrome have abnormal facial development that cause an inverted smile; nerve connections are however normal. When attempting to smile, the child will appear to cry. Urinary problems arise as a result of a neurogenic bladder. Most patients older than the age of toilet training, present with enuresis, urinary-tract infection, hydronephrosis, and a spectrum of radiological abnormalities typical of obstructive or neurogenic bladders. Radiological abnormalities include things such as: trabeculated bladder, vesicoureteral reflex, external sphincter spasm, pyelonephritis, hyperreflexic bladder, noninhibited detrusor contraction, etc. Urinary abnormalities might result in renal deterioration and failure. This can be prevented by taking proper measures to restore normal micturition and by taking antibiotics to prevent infections. In some cases, the affected patients become hypertensive and progress to end-stage renal disease, while others become uremic. Additionally, most patients suffer from constipation.[3]\nEarly detection of this syndrome is possible through the peculiar faces that children present.[citation needed]",
    "Causes": "Urofacial syndrome occurs due to either disruption or mutation of a gene on chromosome 10q23q24.[4] The gene is located on a 1 centimorgan interval between D10S1433 and D10S603.[3] Alteration of this gene leads to alteration of facial and urinary developmental fields. This gene is believed to be the HPSE2 gene. The HPSE2 gene is expressed in both the central nervous system as well as the bladder. Heparanase 2 is protein coded by exons 8 and 9 on the HPSE2 gene. This protein is believed to be altered in the case of this syndrome.[2] Studies performed on mice indicate that HPSE2 has no enzymatic activity.[5]\nMutations in the HPSE2 gene on chromosome 10q23q24 have been observed to cause Ochoa Syndrome. This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome (chromosome 10 is an autosome), and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder.[citation needed]\nThe relationship between a defective HPSE2 gene and Ochoa syndrome is unclear. Early on, there was speculation that the genetic changes may lead to an abnormality in the brain stem. Evidence for this postulation was that the areas of the brain that control facial expression (VII nerve nuclei) and urination (the pontine micturition centre) were believed to be in close proximity of each other. Other hypotheses posit that the defective heparanase 2 protein may lead to problems with development of the urinary tract autonomic nervous system, or with muscle function in the face and bladder.[6]",
    "Treatment": "The treatment varies based on the condition and extent of the uropathy. \nTo empty the bladder regularly, clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) can be used. If the urodynamic study shows non-inhibited detrusor contractions, an anticholinergic drug should be given additionally. To prevent recurrent infections, especially in the case of vesicoureteral reflux, the treatment can also include an antibiotic prophylaxis.[citation needed]",
    "Epidemiology": "Urofacial (Ochoa) syndrome received the Ochoa name because of the first person to describe it in 1987, Bernardo Ochoa.[3]"

    "Disease": "Urticaria pigmentosa",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Urticaria pigmentosa is characterized by excessive amounts of mast cells in the skin.  Red or brown spots are often seen on the skin, typically around the chest, forehead, and back.  These mast cells, when irritated (e.g. by rubbing the skin, heat exposure), produce too much histamine, triggering an allergic reaction that leads to hives localized to the area of irritation, sometimes referred to as Darier's sign.  Severe itching usually follows, and scratching the area only serves to further symptoms.  Symptoms can be mild (flushing and hives that require no treatment), moderate (diarrhea, tachycardia, nausea/vomiting, headache, and fainting), or life-threatening (vascular collapse requiring emergency treatment and hospitalization).[citation needed]",
    "Causes": "The majority of urticaria pigmentosa cases are caused by a point mutation at amino acid 816 of the proto-oncogene c-kit.[2]  c-kit is a transmembrane protein which, when bound to Mast Cell Growth Factor (MCGF), signals the cell to divide.  Mutations in position 816 of c-kit can result in a constant division signal being sent to the mast cells, resulting in abnormal proliferation.  Different mutations have been linked to different onset times of the disease.  \nFor example, the Asp816Phe and Asp816Val mutations (the aspartate normally at position 816 in the c-kit protein has been replaced with phenylalanine or valine respectively) have been associated with early manifestation of the disease (mean age of onset: 1.3 and 5.9 months respectively).[3][4] \nThe c-kit gene is encoded on the q12 locus of chromosome 4.[5]\nSeveral factors can worsen the symptoms of urticaria pigmentosa: [citation needed]\nThe classification of NSAIDs can be disputed.  Aspirin, for example, causes the mast cells to degranulate, releasing histamines and causing symptoms to flare.  However, daily intake of 81 mg aspirin may keep the mast cells degranulated. Thus, while symptoms may be worsened at first, they can get better as the mast cells are unable to recharge with histamine.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "The disease is most often diagnosed as an infant, when parents take their baby in for what appears to be bug bites.  The bug bites are actually the clumps of mast cells.  Doctors can confirm the presence of mast cells by rubbing the baby's skin.  If hives appear, it most likely signifies the presence of urticaria pigmentosa.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "There are no permanent cures for urticaria pigmentosa.  However, treatments are possible.  Most treatments for mastocytosis can be used to treat urticaria pigmentosa.  Many common anti-allergy medications are useful because they reduce the mast cell's ability to react to histamine.[7]\nAt least one clinical study suggested that nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker used to treat high blood pressure, may reduce mast cell degranulation in patients with urticaria pigmentosa.  A 1984 study by Fairly et al. included a patient with symptomatic urticaria pigmentosa who responded to nifedipine taken three times daily.[8] However, nifedipine has never been approved by the FDA for treatment of urticaria pigmentosa.\nAnother mast cell stabilizer, Gastrocrom, a form of cromoglicic acid, has also been used to reduce mast cell degranulation.[citation needed]",
    "Epidemiology": "Urticaria pigmentosa is a rare disease, affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States."

    "Disease": "Uterus didelphys",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Those with the condition may be asymptomatic and unaware of having a double uterus. However, a study by Heinonen showed that certain conditions are more common. In his study of 26 women with a double uterus gynecological complaints included dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia. All patients displayed a double vagina. The fetal survival rate in 18 patients who delivered was 67.5%. Premature delivery occurred in 21% of the pregnancies. Breech presentation occurred in 43% of women and cesarean section was performed in 82% of the cases.[1]",
    "Causes": "The uterus is formed during embryogenesis by the fusion of the two paramesonephric ducts (also called Müllerian ducts). This process usually fuses the two Müllerian ducts into a single uterine body but fails to take place in these affected patients who maintain their double Müllerian systems. A  didelphic uterus will have a double cervix and is usually associated with a double vagina. The cause of the fusion failure is not known. Associated defects may affect the vagina, the renal system and, less commonly, the skeleton.[citation needed]\nThe condition is less common than these other uterine malformations: arcuate uterus, septate uterus, and bicornuate uterus. It has been estimated to occur in 1/3,000 women.[2] In contrast, a unicornuate uterus (in which the Müllerian ducts may or may not fuse but one does not develop properly into uterine tissue) appears to be even rarer still.\nA specific association of uterus didelphys (double uterus), unilateral hematocolpos (inadequate draining of menstrual blood) and ipsilateral renal agenesis (having only one kidney) has been described.[3]",
    "Diagnosis": "A pelvic examination will typically reveal a double vagina and a double cervix. Investigations are usually prompted on the basis of such findings as well as when reproductive problems are encountered. Not all cases of uterus didelphys involve duplication of the cervix and vagina.[citation needed]\nHelpful techniques to investigate the uterine structure are transvaginal ultrasonography and sonohysterography, hysterosalpingography, MRI, and hysteroscopy. More recently 3-D ultrasonography has been advocated as an excellent non-invasive method to evaluate uterine malformations.[4]\nUterus didelphys is often confused with a complete uterine septum. Often more than one method of investigation is necessary to accurately diagnose the condition. Correct diagnosis is crucial as treatment for these two conditions are very different.[5] Whereas most doctors recommend removal of a uterine septum, they generally concur that it is better not to operate on a uterus didelphys. In either case, a highly qualified reproductive endocrinologist should be consulted.",
    "Treatment": "Patients with a double uterus may need special attention during pregnancy as premature birth and malpresentation are common. Cesarean section was performed in 82% of patients reported by Heinonen.[1]\nUterus didelphys, in certain studies, has also been found associated with higher rate of infertility, miscarriage, intrauterine growth restriction, and postpartum bleed.[5]",
    "Epidemiology": "In the United States, uterus didelphys is reported to occur in 0.1–0.5% of women. It is difficult to know the exact occurrence of this anomaly, as it may go undetected in the absence of medical and reproductive complications.[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "Uveal melanoma",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Ocular melanoma may present without symptoms depending upon the location and size of the tumor. When symptoms do occur, they can include:[7]",
    "Causes": "The cause of uveal melanoma is unclear. Uveal nevi are common (5% of Caucasians),[19] but rarely progress to melanoma.",
    "Treatment": "The treatment protocol for uveal melanoma has been directed by many clinical studies, the most important being The Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study (COMS).[26] The treatment varies depending upon many factors, chief among them the size of the tumor and results from testing of biopsied material from the tumor. Primary treatment can involve removal of the affected eye (enucleation); however, this is now reserved for cases of extreme tumor burden or other secondary problems.  Advances in radiation therapies have significantly decreased the number of patients treated by enucleation in developed countries.\nThe most common radiation treatment is plaque brachytherapy, in which a small disc-shaped shield (plaque) encasing radioactive seeds (most often iodine-125, though ruthenium-106 and palladium-103 are also used) is attached to the outside surface of the eye, overlying the tumor. The plaque is left in place for a few days and then removed. The risk of metastasis after plaque radiotherapy is the same as that of enucleation, suggesting that micrometastatic spread occurs prior to treatment of the primary tumor.\nProton therapy delivers powerful doses of radiation to the tumor while sparing surrounding healthy eye tissue. The treatment is also effective at controlling tumor growth and maintaining a patient's natural eye.\nOn January 25, 2022, the FDA approved tebentafusp (Kimmtrak) for adult HLA-A*2-positive patients with metastatic uveal melanoma. Approval was based on the IMCgp100-202 trial (NCT03070392), which compared tebentafusp with investigator's choice of either dacarbazine, pembrolizumab or ipilimumab. Patients lived a median of 16 months when treated with investigator's choice of therapy, compared to a median 21.7 months with tebentafusp. This translated in a 49% reduction in the risk of death. Overall survival after one year of treatment was 59% in the control group, versus 73% in the tebentafusp group.[27]\nOther modalities of treatment include transpupillary thermotherapy, resection of the tumor, gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery, or a combination of different modalities. Different surgical resection techniques can include trans-scleral partial choroidectomy and transretinal endoresection.\nA  2017 analysis of genomic data led to a new analysis of clinical subtyping in uveal melanoma.[28]\nOcular melanoma expert Professor Sarah Coupland, in 2018, suggested cautious optimism as new types of targeted therapeutics are tested and approved.[29][needs update]",
    "Prognosis": "When eye melanoma is spread to distant parts of the body, the five-year survival rate is about 15%.[6]\nSeveral clinical and pathological prognostic factors have been identified that are associated with higher risk of metastasis of uveal melanomas. These include large tumor size, ciliary body involvement, presence of orange pigment overlying the tumor, and older patient age.[30][31] Likewise several histological and cytological factors are associated with higher risk of metastasis, including presence and extent of cells with epithelioid morphology, presence of looping extracellular matrix patterns, increased infiltration of immune cells,[21] and staining with several immunohistochemical markers.[32]\nThe most important genetic alteration associated with poor prognosis in uveal melanoma is inactivation of BAP1, which most often occurs through mutation of one allele and subsequent loss of an entire copy of chromosome 3 (monosomy 3) to unmask the mutant copy.[17] Because of this function in inactivation of BAP1, monosomy 3 correlates strongly with metastatic spread[33] Where BAP1 mutation status is not available, gains on chromosomes 6 and 8 can be used to refine the predictive value of the monosomy 3 screen, with gain of 6p indicating a better prognosis and gain of 8q indicating a worse prognosis in disomy 3 tumors.[34]  In rare instances, monosomy 3 tumors may duplicate the BAP1-mutant copy of the chromosome to return to a disomic state referred to as isodisomy.[35]  Thus, isodisomy 3 is prognostically equivalent to monosomy 3, and both can be detected by tests for chromosome 3 loss of heterozygosity.[36] Monosomy 3, along with other chromosomal gains, losses, amplifications, and LOH, can be detected in fresh or paraffin-embedded samples by virtual karyotyping.\nThe most accurate prognostic factor is molecular classification by gene expression profiling of uveal melanomas.  This analysis has been used to identify two subclasses of uveal melanomas: class 1 tumors that have a very low risk of metastasis, and class 2 tumors that have a very high risk of metastasis.[37][38] Gene expression profiling outperforms all of the above-mentioned factors at predicting metastatic spread of the primary tumor, including monosomy 3.[39][40][41]\nCurrently, there is no consensus regarding type or frequency of scans following diagnosis and treatment of the primary eye tumor.\nOf the 50% of patients who develop metastatic disease, more than 90% of patients will develop liver metastases. As such, the majority of surveillance techniques are focused on the liver. These include abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), abdominal ultrasound and liver function tests. The scientific community is currently working to develop guidelines, but until then, each patient must take into consideration their individual clinical situation and discuss appropriate surveillance with their doctors.[42]\nSome ophthalmologists have also found promise with the use of intravitreal avastin injections in patients with radiation-induced retinopathy, a side effect of plaque brachytherapy treatment, as well as imaging surveillance with SD-OCT.",
    "Epidemiology": "Uveal melanomas are the most common primary intraocular tumor in adults.[21]  Uveal melanoma is classified as a rare cancer with 5.1 cases per million people per year.[43] The incidence has remained stable for several years.\nThere are about 2500 patients with UM diagnosed annually in the US.[44]\nIn 2018, it was reported that two clusters of cases have been identified in Huntersville, North Carolina, and Auburn, Alabama. Cases involved alumni of Auburn University who were acquainted with each other. Health officials investigated and found that the \"cluster\" is an artifact of social networking.[45][46][47]"

    "Disease": "Vaginal hypoplasia",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Vaginal hypoplasia can vary in severity from being smaller than normal to being completely absent. The absence of a vagina is a result of vaginal agenesis. Diagnostically, it may look similar to a vaginal obstruction such as can be caused by an imperforate hymen or, less commonly, a transverse vaginal septum.[citation needed]\nIt is frequently associated with Mayer-Rokitansky-Küstner-Hauser syndrome, in which the most common result is an absent uterus in conjunction with a deformed or missing vagina, despite the presence of normal ovaries and normal external genitalia. It is also associated with cervical agenesis, in which the uterus is present but the uterine cervix is absent. The situation is most urgent where there is a menstruating uterus with an obstructed uterovaginal outflow, leading to hematometra. In this case prompt medical action is required.[citation needed]",
    "Causes": "The main causes are Müllerian agenesis and complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.[1]",
    "Treatment": "In order to facilitate sexual intercourse, the main treatments are self-dilation methods (using intra-vaginal cylinders or inflatable expanders (vaginal stents) of increasing size) and surgical vaginoplasty to lengthen the vagina.[1] Self-dilation has a high success rate, estimated at 75%, and is usually the first-line treatment due to low surgical invasiveness.[1] Overall, the complication rates are significantly lower with dilation  than with vaginoplasty.[1]\nSurgery is indicated when there is inability or reluctance to perform self-dilation, or where it is performed but with failed result. The vaginoplasty is performed around the inflatable expander which maintains the neovagina against the pelvic wall after the surgery and favors the process of microscopic neovascularization while reducing the risks for hematoma.[2][3] One appropriate surgical variant is the Vecchietti technique. In this procedure, an olive-shaped pressure device is pressed towards the potential vaginal space by a thread that goes through the skin, behind the urinary bladder and pubic bone and exits the skin in the hypogastrium, where it is attached to a plate that provides counter-traction.[1] Vaginoplasty can also be performed using a skin graft or an intestinal graft. Traction vaginoplasty such as the Vecchietti technique seems to have the highest success rates both anatomically (99%) and functionally (96%), whereas skin graft procedures and intestinal procedures have the lowest successful outcomes (83–95%).[1]\nAfter vaginoplasty, available evidence suggests that continued self-dilation is needed to maintain the patency in periods of coital inactivity.[1] A vaginal expander can be used regularly to prevent post-operative vaginal retraction.[4]",
    "Epidemiology": "Vaginal hypoplasia is estimated to occur in 1 in 4,000–5,000 live female births. It is often unnoticed until adolescence when pain and a lack of menstrual flow indicates the condition.[5]"

    "Disease": "Variant Creutzfeldt%E2%80%93Jakob disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Initial symptoms include psychiatric problems, behavioral changes, and painful sensations.[1] In the later stages of the illness, patients may exhibit poor coordination, dementia and involuntary movements.[2] The length of time between exposure and the development of symptoms is unclear, but is believed to be years.[3] Average life expectancy following the onset of symptoms is 13 months.[1]",
    "Causes": "In Britain, the primary cause of vCJD has been eating beef tainted with bovine spongiform encephalopathy.[12] A 2012 study by the Health Protection Agency found that around 1 in 2000 had abnormal prions present in appendix cells.[13]\nJonathan Quick, instructor of medicine at the Department of Global Health and Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School, stated that bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is the first man-made epidemic, or \"Frankenstein\" disease, because a human decision to feed meat and bone meal to previously herbivorous cattle (as a source of protein) caused what was previously an animal pathogen to enter into the human food chain, and from there to begin causing humans to contract vCJD.[14]\nThe risk of contracting vCJD from ingestion of cattle products has led to many countries banning the import of beef from countries where BSE has been known to occur, such as the ban on beef from the United States imposed by Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Canada, and other countries in 2003 immediately following the first reported case of BSE in American cattle. Stringent preventative and surveillance practices implemented since then to prevent the disease from entering the human and cattle food chains have caused some to conclude that such bans are unnecessary.[15]\nAs of 2018, evidence suggests that there may be prions in the blood of individuals with vCJD, but this is not the case in individuals with sporadic CJD.[12]\nIn 2004, a report showed that vCJD can be transmitted by blood transfusions.[16] The finding alarmed healthcare officials because a large epidemic of the disease could result in the near future. A blood test for vCJD infection is possible[17] but is not yet available for screening blood donations. Significant restrictions exist to protect the blood supply. The UK government banned anyone who had received a blood transfusion since January 1980 from donating blood.[18] Since 1999 there has been a ban in the UK for using UK blood to manufacture fractional products such as albumin.[19]\nWhilst these restrictions may go some way to preventing a self-sustaining epidemic of secondary infections, the number of infected blood donations is unknown and could be considerable. In June 2013 the government was warned that deaths, then at 176, could rise five-fold through blood transfusions.[20]\nOn 28 May 2002, the United States Food and Drug Administration instituted a policy that excludes from blood donation anyone having spent at least six months in certain European countries (or three months in the United Kingdom) from 1980 to 1996. Given the large number of U.S. military personnel and their dependents residing in Europe, it was expected that over 7% of donors would be deferred due to the policy. Later changes to this policy first relaxed the restriction to a cumulative total of five years or more of civilian travel in European countries (six months or more if military) then, in 2022, removed it entirely.[21]\nIn New Zealand, the New Zealand Blood Service (NZBS) in 2000 introduced measures to preclude permanently donors having resided in the United Kingdom (including the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands) for a total of six months or more between January 1980 and December 1996. The measure resulted in ten percent of New Zealand's active blood donors at the time becoming ineligible to donate blood. In 2003, the NZBS further extended restrictions to permanently preclude donors having received a blood transfusion in the United Kingdom since January 1980, and in April 2006, restrictions were further extended to include the Republic of Ireland and France.[22] The restriction was rescinded in late February 2024.[23]\nSimilar regulations are in place where anyone having spent more than six months for Germany or one year for France living in the UK between January 1980 and December 1996 is permanently banned from donating blood.[24][25]\nIn Canada, individuals were formerly ineligible to donate blood or plasma if they had spent a cumulative total of three months or more in the mainland UK or its Crown Dependencies or six months or more in Saudi Arabia from January 1, 1980, through December 31, 1996. They were also ineligible if they had spent a cumulative total of five years or more in France or the Republic of Ireland from January 1, 1980, through 31 December 2001. These restrictions were removed by December 2023.[26]\nIn Poland, anyone having spent cumulatively six months or longer between 1 January 1980 and 31 December 1996 in the UK, Ireland, or France is permanently barred from donating.[27]\nIn France, anyone having lived or stayed in the United Kingdom a total of over one year between 1 January 1980 and 31 December 1996 is permanently barred from donating.[28]\nIn the Czech Republic, anyone having spent more than twelve months in the UK or France between 1980 and 1996 or received transfusion in the UK after the year 1980 is not allowed to donate blood.[29]\nIn Finland, anyone having lived or stayed in the mainland United Kingdom or its Crown Dependencies for a total of over six months between 1 January 1980 and 31 December 1996 is permanently barred from donating.[30]\nIn the U.S., the FDA has banned import of any donor sperm, motivated by a risk of variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, inhibiting the once popular[31] import of Scandinavian sperm. Despite this, the scientific consensus is that the risk is negligible, as there is no evidence Creutzfeldt–Jakob is sexually transmitted.[32][33][34]\nIn France, the last two victims of variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, who died in 2019 and 2021, were research technicians at the National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and the Environment (INRAE). Emilie Jaumain, who died in 2019, at the age of 33, had been the victim of a work accident in 2010, during which she had pricked herself with a tool contaminated with infected brain.[35] The efficacy of this route of contamination has been unambiguously demonstrated in primates.[36] Pierrette C., who died in 2021, had been victim of the same type of work accident.[37][38] After her diagnosis, a moratorium was initiated in all French laboratories on research activities on infectious prions.[39] In March 2022, INRAE recognized the occupational cause of these two deaths.[40][41] This raises serious questions about the safety of personnel in these laboratories. Indeed, inspections have noted serious failures in the protection of agents in the face of this deadly risk,[42][43] and the long incubation period of this disease leads to fears of new cases in the future, hence great concern.[44]\nA 1997 article by the Lancet[45] postulated that a connection existed between the consumption of squirrel brains and CJD. Media reporting on this myth was reignited in 2018 when an article by Live Science[46] reported on a Rochester man who was alleged to have contracted vCJD from his consumption of squirrel brains.\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob Disease and eating squirrel brains, the 1997 article by the Lancet has been almost entirely discredited due its lack of scientific evidence and false statistical assumptions. An article published by the New Yorker in the year 2000, shortly following the release of the 1997 Lancet article was one of the first to report on the lack of scientific footing for the Lancet's study. It reported that many issues revolved around the researchers conflating statistical correlation with epidemiological causation. This is especially important with a slow moving, and hard to trace disease like vCJD, a point emphasized in their statement that \"the Lancet study blundered blithely into such statistical pitfalls\".[47]\nOne of the most direct and robust dismissals of the connection between consumption of squirrel brains and vCJD was a statement made in 2018 by the Creutzfeldt–Jakob Disease Foundation, addressing both the 1997 Lancet article and Live Science article. This statement was part of a press release, reading that “The previous ProMed commentary mentioned a 1997 Lancet report that hypothesized about a potential link between consumption of squirrel brains and CJD; there was no mention of vCJD in that report. Since that brief report, there has been no convincing evidence found suggesting that the consumption of squirrel meat, brain or otherwise, is a risk factor for any prion disease. While prion diseases have been identified in several other types of mammals, they have never been identified in squirrels. Without additional experimental or epidemiological evidence, a link between consumption of squirrel brain and human prion disease is unjustifiably speculative.”[48]\nAn article by Democrat and Chronicle provided another primary source debunking this myth. This report included interviews with the epidemiologist overseeing the 2018 case reported on by Live Science. In a statement, Dr. Emil Lesho stated that “We never thought squirrel brains”.[49]\nDespite the fact that there is no scientific basis for this connection, much reporting surrounds both the 1997 Lancet article, and the 2018 Live Science article, most echoing their statements. Although eating the nervous tissue of any mammal is not recommended due to the risk of disease transmission, fundamentally, there is no robust scientific evidence that the consumption of squirrel brains presents a risk factor for vCJD at any level, or has ever caused a case of vCJD in humans.",
    "Diagnosis": "Examination of brain tissue is required to confirm a diagnosis of variant CJD.[2] The following confirmatory features should be present:[2]\nvCJD is a separate condition from classic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (though both are caused by PrP prions).[9] Both classic and variant CJD are subtypes of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. There are three main categories of CJD disease: sporadic CJD, hereditary CJD, and acquired CJD, with variant CJD being in the acquired group along with iatrogenic CJD.[53][54] The classic form includes sporadic and hereditary forms.[55] Sporadic CJD is the most common type.[54]\nICD-10 has no separate code for vCJD and such cases are reported under the Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease code (A81.0).[56]",
    "Epidemiology": "The Lancet in 2006 suggested that it may take more than 50 years for vCJD to develop, from their studies of kuru, a similar disease in Papua New Guinea.[57] The reasoning behind the claim is that kuru was possibly transmitted through cannibalism in Papua New Guinea when family members would eat the body of a dead relative as a sign of mourning. In the 1950s, cannibalism was banned in Papua New Guinea.[58]\nIn the late 20th century, however, kuru reached epidemic proportions in certain Papua New Guinean communities, therefore suggesting that vCJD may also have a similar incubation period of 20 to 50 years. A critique to this theory is that while mortuary cannibalism was banned in Papua New Guinea in the 1950s, that does not necessarily mean that the practice ended. Fifteen years later Jared Diamond was informed by Papuans that the practice continued.[58]\nThese researchers noticed a genetic variation[59] in some people with kuru that has been known to promote long incubation periods. They have also proposed that individuals having contracted CJD in the early 1990s represent a distinct genetic subpopulation, with unusually short incubation periods for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). This means that there may be many more people with vCJD with longer incubation periods, which may surface many years later.[57]\nPrion protein is detectable in lymphoid and appendix tissue up to two years before the onset of neurological symptoms in vCJD. Large scale studies in the UK have yielded an estimated prevalence of 493 per million, higher than the actual number of reported cases. This finding indicates a large number of asymptomatic cases and the need to monitor.[60]",
    "Society and culture": "The first human death from vCJD occurred in the United Kingdom; Wiltshire teenager Stephen Churchill died on 23 May 1995, aged 19.[61][62] Researchers believe one in 2,000 people in the UK is a carrier of the disease, linked to eating contaminated beef.[63] The survey provides the most robust prevalence measure to date—and identifies abnormal prion protein across a wider age group than found previously and in all genotypes, indicating \"infection\" may be relatively common. This new study examined over 32,000 anonymous appendix samples. Of these, 16 samples were positive for abnormal prion protein, indicating an overall prevalence of 493 per million population, or one in 2,000 people are likely to be carriers. No difference was seen in different birth cohorts (1941–1960 and 1961–1985), in both sexes, and there was no apparent difference in abnormal prion prevalence in three broad geographical areas. Genetic testing of the 16 positive samples revealed a higher proportion of valine homozygous (VV) genotype on the codon 129 of the gene encoding the prion protein (PRNP) compared with the general UK population. This also differs from the 176 people with vCJD, all of whom to date have been methionine homozygous (MM) genotype. The concern is that individuals with this VV genotype may be susceptible to developing the condition over longer incubation periods.[64]\nIn 2000 a voluntary support group was formed by families of people who had died from vCJD. The goal was to support other families going through a similar experience. This support was provided through a National Helpline, a Carer's Guide, a website and a network of family befriending. The support groups had an internet presence at the turn of the 21st century. The driving force behind the foundation was Lester Firkins, whose young son had died from the disease.[65][66]\nIn October 2000 the report of the government inquiry into BSE chaired by Lord Phillips was published.[67] The BSE report criticised former Conservative Party Agriculture Ministers John Gummer, John MacGregor and Douglas Hogg.[68] The report concluded that the escalation of BSE into a crisis was the result of intensive farming, particularly with cows being fed with cow and sheep remains. Furthermore, the report was critical of the way the crisis had been handled.[69] There was a reluctance to consider the possibility that BSE could cross the species barrier. The government assured the public that British beef was safe to eat, with agriculture minister John Gummer famously feeding his daughter a burger. The British government were reactive more than proactive in response; the worldwide ban on all British beef exports in March 1996 was a serious economic blow.[70]\nThe foundation had been calling for compensation to include a care package to help relatives look after those with vCJD. There have been widespread complaints of inadequate health and social services support.[71] Following the Phillips Report in October 2001, the government announced a compensation scheme for British people affected with vCJD. The multi-million-pound financial package was overseen by the vCJD Trust.\nA memorial plaque for those who have died due to vCJD was installed in central London in approximately 2000.[72] It is located on the boundary wall of St Thomas' Hospital in Lambeth facing the Riverside Walk of Albert Embankment.[73]"

    "Disease": "Very long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Signs and symptoms can include:[5][6]",
    "Causes": "VLCAD (very long-chain-acyl-dehydrogenase) deficiency is exclusively linked to genetic mutations in DNA. A change of the gene that codes for very long-chain-acyl-CoA-dehydrogenase (VLCAD) results in a deficiency or malfunction of the produced VLCAD enzyme.[7] This mutation occurs on chromosome 17 and can be altered via a variety of pathways.[4] These can range from frameshift mutations, deletion mutations, insertion mutations, and missense mutations. All of which cause the enzyme to function differently in the mitochondria, or in some cases not at all.[4] Due to this mutation, effective levels of very long-chain-acyl-CoA-dehydrogenase are low or absent in the body, giving rise to the array of symptoms listed above.[4][7]",
    "Diagnosis": "Typically, initial signs and symptoms of this disorder occur during infancy and include low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), lack of energy (lethargy), and muscle weakness. There is also a high risk of complications such as liver abnormalities and life-threatening heart problems. Symptoms that begin later in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood tend to be milder and usually do not involve heart problems. Episodes of very long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency can be triggered by periods of fasting, illness, and exercise.[citation needed]\nIt is common for babies and children with the early and childhood types of VLCAD to have episodes of illness known as metabolic crises. Some of the first symptoms of a metabolic crisis are: extreme sleepiness, behavior changes, irritable mood, poor appetite.\nSome of these other symptoms of VLCAD in infants may also follow: fever, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, hypoglycemia. Evaluation of symptom combinations can aid in a positive diagnosis of VLCAD.[9] Since symptoms vary depending on age and onset of the patient, consultation with a metabolic specialist should be considered. Diagnosis is further confirmed through genetic analysis of the VLCAD gene.[9]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment and management of VLCAD deficiency involve dietary restrictions as well as implementation of proper hydration to avoid further complications.  Hospitalization due to VLCAD deficiency can be treated with intravenous (IV) glucose for hydration and alkalization of urine and prevention of renal malfunction or failure.[10]  Avoidance of fasting periods, high-fat diets, and dehydration is recommended for those who are affected.  A diet consisting of low-fat intake and supplemental calories is common for management of VLCAD deficiency.  If a metabolic crisis is not treated, a child with VLCAD can develop: breathing problems, seizures, coma, sometimes leading to death.[citation needed]",
    "Prognosis": "Medical screening can confirm occurrences of VLCAD most often in neonatal and infancy stages. Approximately half of all patients show signs of VLCAD deficiency during the neonatal period, one-fourth present later in the first year of infancy, and the final quarter is split between manifestations in childhood and adulthood.[citation needed] Comorbidity of cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias[3] and rhabdomyolysis are extremely common in patients under 1 year old which can lead to complications later in life[citation needed]. Loss of awareness or seizure can occur from hypoketotic hypoglycemia,[3] which is often fatal if not caught in screening. However, prompt treatment shows high promise for improvement. People who develop late-onset myopathic may only experience muscle-related, vague, sporadic symptoms, and may never be diagnosed.[3] There is an extremely high genotype-phenotype correlation in a presentation. Mitigation of VLCAD symptoms can be achieved through dietary management[citation needed]."

    "Disease": "Vestigial twin",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Woman who are pregnant do not experience any different symptoms when carrying vestigial twins compared to a normal pregnancy.\nOnce the fetus is born, the presentation will typically consist of an extra extremity attached to the dominant twins body. Only the dominant fetus will be viable. The limbs attached will contain nerve endings, bones, and tissue. In some cases, the fetus can be born with a attached limb as a \"tail.\" This tail is the extension of the coccygeal vertebra.[2] The parasitic twins limbs can be attached to the dominant twin at more than one location, for example the head, torso, pelvis, buttocks, back, etc. [3]",
    "Causes": "This phenomenon occurs when a fertilized ovum or partially formed embryo splits incompletely. The result is one dominant twin with extra body parts belonging to the vestigial twin. It is also possible for tail-like tissue to form around the sacrum.[2] One theory proposes that the usage of teratogenic drugs by the mother may be a factor in the development of vestigial parasitic twins. The cause for vestigial twins is still unclear.[4]\nThere is no way to prevent this from occurring. This disease is not contagious and occurs rarely in pregnancies. There are currently no Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations on this, as this is a rare occurrence.[3]",
    "Diagnosis": "Early diagnosis can be found during a prenatal ultrasound. A prenatal ultrasound uses sound waves to show the fetus in the womb.[5] However, there have been cases that it was not possible to diagnose the vestigial twin before birth using an ultrasound. There is no way to prevent vestigial twins or diagnose vestigial twins through pregnancy symptoms.Vestigial twins can be diagnosed before birth through an ultrasound or other imaging such as MRI or Ct scan. An MRI or CT scan can show how the twins are connected, After birth the diagnoses can be made by looking at the parasitic twin attached to the vestigial twin. An obstetric and gynecology physician can be treat and diagnose this patient, however a pregnant women would be referred to a maternal and fetal medicine specialist. It is possible to have different surgeons assigned to the case to assist with removing the parasitic twin. There have been cases where it is difficult to visualize the parasitic twins on an ultrasound, which would cause a delay in diagnoses until birth. If the expecting mother does not receive prenatal visits a delay in diagnosis would occur. However, once the vestigial twins are born it would be easily diagnosed during a physical exam.[6]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment for vestigial twins typically includes having surgery to remove the parasitic twin. If the parasitic twin is not removed the risk for further complications increases significantly. The twin supporting the parasitic twin can have complications. Therefore, the best course of treatment would be to remove the attached parasitic twin. A healthcare provider would schedule additional tests to check to see if the fetus has any complications and treat them. Treatment for other complications would be different based on each case. [1]\nAfter the fetus undergoes the procedure to remove the parasitic twin there is a risk to developing infection, hernia, and typical surgical complications. There are no holistic treatment options other than leaving the parasitic twin attached, however leaving the parasitic twin attached to the dominant twin can lead to further complications for the dominant twin. The dominant twins body can be put under a lot of stress if still attached to the parasitic twin. Surgery to remove the parasitic twin is the only treatment to remove the parasitic twin from the dominant twin.[1]",
    "Prognosis": "The typical prognosis for the case studies that have been found is overall good once the parasitic twin is separated. If the host twin has some complications, such as a hernia or infection, more treatment may be needed. The occurrence does not repeat after the parasitic twin is removed.[3]\nIt is unclear if there is an environmental or hereditary risk factor associated with vestigial twins. However, researchers believe that abnormalities in the SHH protein can create a risk or a possible explanation for having vestigial twins.[3]",
    "Epidemiology": "Vestigial twins is a rare occurrence, it has been reported that it occurs less than 1 in 1 million births. Woman of child bearing ages that are pregnant with twins can be impacted. Twin fetuses that are still developing in the womb can become vestigial twins, although this is a rare occurrence. Since this occurrence is so sparse it is unclear whether it impacts different ethnicities or races.[7] However, rachipagus parasiticus, an extremely rare type of parasitic twins, is most commonly reported in Ethiopia. Rachipagus parasiticus is where the parasitic twin is attached to the spine.[8]"

    "Disease": "Vogt%E2%80%93Koyanagi%E2%80%93Harada disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The disease is characterised by bilateral diffuse uveitis, with pain, redness and blurring of vision. The eye symptoms may be accompanied by a varying constellation of systemic symptoms, such as auditory (tinnitus,[6] vertigo,[6] and hypoacusis), neurological (meningismus, with malaise, fever, headache, nausea, abdominal pain, stiffness of the neck and back, or a combination of these factors;[6] meningitis,[4] CSF pleocytosis, cranial nerve palsies, hemiparesis, transverse myelitis and ciliary ganglionitis[6]), and cutaneous manifestations, including poliosis, vitiligo, and alopecia.[4][5][6] The vitiligo often is found at the sacral region.[6]\nThe sequence of clinical events in VKH is divided into four phases - prodromal, acute uveitic, convalescent, and chronic recurrent.[2][5][6]\nThe prodromal phase may have no symptoms, or may mimic a nonspecific viral infection, marked by flu-like symptoms that typically last for a few days.[6] Fever, headache, nausea, meningismus, dysacusia (discomfort caused by loud noises or a distortion in the quality of the sounds being heard), tinnitus, and/or vertigo may occur.[6][7] Eye symptoms can include orbital pain, photophobia, and tearing.[6] The skin and hair may be sensitive to touch.[6][7] Cranial nerve palsies and optic neuritis are uncommon.[6]\nThe acute uveitic phase occurs a few days later and typically lasts for several weeks.[6] This phase is heralded by bilateral panuveitis causing blurring of vision.[6] In 70% of VKH cases, the onset of visual blurring is bilaterally contemporaneous; if initially unilateral, the other eye is involved within several days.[6] The process can include bilateral granulomatous anterior uveitis, variable degree of vitritis, thickening of the posterior choroid with elevation of the peripapillary retinal choroidal layer, optic nerve hyperemia and papillitis, and multiple exudative bullous serous retinal detachments.[2][5][6]\nThe convalescent phase is characterized by gradual tissue depigmentation of skin with vitiligo and poliosis, sometimes with nummular depigmented scars, as well as alopecia and diffuse fundus depigmentation resulting in a classic orange-red discoloration (\"sunset glow fundus\"[5][8][7]) and retinal pigment epithelium clumping and/or migration.[2][6]\nThe chronic recurrent phase may be marked by repeated bouts of uveitis, but is more commonly a chronic, low-grade, often subclinical, uveitis that may lead to granulomatous anterior inflammation, cataracts, glaucoma, and ocular hypertension.[2][3][5][6] Full-blown recurrences, though, are rare after the acute stage is over.[8] Dysacusia may occur in this phase.[7]",
    "Causes": "Although sometimes a viral infection, or skin or eye trauma precedes an outbreak,[6] the exact underlying initiator of VKH disease remains unknown.[4] VKH is attributed, however, to aberrant T-cell-mediated immune response directed against self-antigens found on melanocytes.[3][4][6] Stimulated by interleukin 23 (IL-23), T helper 17 cells and cytokines, such as interleukin 17, appear to target proteins in the melanocytes.[8][9]",
    "Diagnosis": "If tested in the prodromal phase, cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis is found in more than 80% of cases,[6][7] with mainly lymphocytes.[7] This pleocytosis resolves in about 8 weeks even if chronic uveitis persists.[7]\nFunctional tests may include electroretinogram and visual field testing.[2] Diagnostic confirmation and an estimation of disease severity may involve imaging tests such as retinography, fluorescein or indocyanine green angiography, optical coherence tomography and ultrasound.[2][5][9][7] For example, indocyanine green angiography may detect continuing choroidal inflammation in the eyes without clinical symptoms or signs.[5][8] Ocular MRI may be helpful[6] and auditory symptoms should undergo audiologic testing.[6] Histopathology findings from eye and skin are discussed by Walton.[6]\nThe diagnosis of VKH is based on the clinical presentation; the diagnostic differential is extensive, and includes sympathetic ophthalmia, sarcoidosis, primary intraocular B-cell lymphoma, posterior scleritis, uveal effusion syndrome, tuberculosis, syphilis, and multifocal choroidopathy syndromes.[3][6]\nBased on the presence of extraocular findings, such as neurological, auditory, and integumentary manifestations, the \"revised diagnostic criteria\" of 2001[2][11] classify the disease as complete (eyes along with both neurological and skin), incomplete (eyes along with either neurological or skin), or probable (eyes without either neurological or skin) .[1][3][5][6][11] By definition, for research homogeneity purposes, the two exclusion criteria are previous ocular penetrating trauma or surgery, and other concomitant ocular disease similar to VKH disease.[2][6][11]",
    "Treatment": "The acute uveitis phase of VKH is usually responsive to high-dose oral corticosteroids; parenteral administration is usually not required.[2][3][6] However, ocular complications may require a subtenon[6] or intravitreous injection of corticosteroids[4][6] or bevacizumab.[9] In refractory situations, other immunosuppressives such as cyclosporine,[2][3] or tacrolimus,[9] antimetabolites (azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil or methotrexate[9]), or biological agents such as intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) or infliximab may be needed.[2][6]",
    "Prognosis": "Visual prognosis is generally good with prompt diagnosis and aggressive immunomodulatory treatment.[2][3][8] Inner ear symptoms usually respond to corticosteroid therapy within weeks to months; hearing usually recovers completely.[6] Chronic eye effects such as cataracts, glaucoma, and optic atrophy can occur.[6] Skin changes usually persist despite therapy.[6]"

    "Disease": "Von Hippel%E2%80%93Lindau disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Signs and symptoms associated with VHL disease include headaches, problems with balance and walking, dizziness, weakness of the limbs, vision problems, and high blood pressure.\nSix organ systems mainly are affected: CNS (Central Nervous System); retina; pancreas; kidney; adrenal gland; epididymis.[7]\nConditions associated with VHL disease include angiomatosis, hemangioblastomas, pheochromocytoma, renal cell carcinoma, pancreatic cysts (pancreatic serous cystadenoma), endolymphatic sac tumor, and bilateral papillary cystadenomas of the epididymis (men) or broad ligament of the uterus (women).[8][9] Angiomatosis occurs in 37.2% of patients presenting with VHL disease and usually occurs in the retina. As a result, loss of vision is very common. However, other organs can be affected: strokes, heart attacks, and cardiovascular disease are common additional symptoms.[6] Approximately 40% of VHL disease presents with CNS hemangioblastomas and they are present in around 60–80%. Spinal hemangioblastomas are found in 13–59% of VHL disease and are specific because 80% are found in VHL disease.[10][11] Although all of these tumors are common in VHL disease, around half of cases present with only one tumor type.[11] Most people with VHL develop symptoms in their mid-twenties.[12]",
    "Diagnosis": "The detection of tumours specific to VHL disease is important in the disease's diagnosis. In individuals with a family history of VHL disease, one hemangioblastoma, pheochromocytoma or renal cell carcinoma may be sufficient to make a diagnosis. As all the tumours associated with VHL disease can be found sporadically, at least two tumours must be identified to diagnose VHL disease in a person without a family history.[10][11][19]\nGenetic diagnosis is also useful in VHL disease diagnosis. In hereditary VHL disease, techniques such as the Southern blot and gene sequencing can be used to analyse DNA and identify mutations. These tests can be used to screen family members of those afflicted with VHL disease; de novo cases that produce genetic mosaicism are more difficult to detect because mutations are not found in the white blood cells that are used for genetic analysis.[10][20]",
    "Treatment": "Early recognition and treatment of specific manifestations of VHL can substantially decrease complications and improve quality of life. For this reason, individuals with VHL disease are usually screened routinely for retinal angiomas, CNS hemangioblastomas, clear-cell renal carcinomas and pheochromocytomas.[26] CNS hemangioblastomas are usually surgically removed if they are symptomatic. Photocoagulation and cryotherapy are usually used for the treatment of symptomatic retinal angiomas, although anti-angiogenic treatments may also be an option. Renal tumours may be removed by a partial nephrectomy or other techniques such as radiofrequency ablation.[10]\nBelzutifan is a drug approved for the treatment of von Hippel–Lindau disease-associated renal cell carcinoma and sold by Merck under the name Welireg.[27][28]",
    "Epidemiology": "VHL disease has an incidence of one in 36,000 births. There is over 90% penetrance by the age of 65.[29] Age at diagnosis varies from infancy to age 60–70 years, with an average patient age at clinical diagnosis of 26 years.[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "Wandering spleen",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Although symptoms include an enlargement in the size of the spleen,[2] or a change from the spleen's original position to another location, usually in either other parts of the abdomen or into the pelvis. This ability to move to other locations is commonly attributed to the spleen's pedicle being abnormally long.[3]\nPhysical factors may cause ischuria, constipation, as well as numerous spleen-related diseases such as hypersplenism, thrombocytopenia, and lymphoma.[4] Blocking of the arteries and torsion (twisting that interrupts the blood supply to that organ) in the spleen can also result in abdominal pain or swelling.[5] However, lack of visible symptoms — except in incidents of abdominal pain — makes the disease difficult for doctors to diagnose,[6] though medical imaging techniques such as medical ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, or computed tomography can be used to confirm its occurrence. Characteristics of the disorder include the loss, weakening, or malformation of the ligaments[2] that help to keep the spleen located in the upper left part of the abdomen.[citation needed]",
    "Causes": "Though not a genetic disease, wandering spleen is often found at birth. It can occur in  adults as the result of injuries and other similar conditions that cause the ligaments to weaken, such as connective tissue disease or pregnancy.[2] Wandering spleen (splenoptosis) predisposes the spleen to complications such as torsion, splenic infarction, pancreatic necrosis and rarely pseudocyst formation.[7]",
    "Treatment": "The usual treatment is splenopexy, fixation of the spleen, but if there is no blood flow after unwinding the spleen through detorsion then splenectomy must be performed.[6] Although there have been few reported cases of treatment through laparoscopic surgery due to the rarity of the disease, it has been proven to be an effective surgical technique.[8]",
    "Epidemiology": "Wandering spleen is most commonly diagnosed in young children[3] as well as women between the ages of 20 and 40.[6] Even so, the disease is very rare and fewer than 500 occurrences of the disease have been reported as of 2005,[3] of which around 148 (including both children and adult cases) were documented to have been from between 1960 and 1992.[4] Less than 0.5% of all splenectomies, surgical removal of the spleen, are performed due to having this disorder.\nIn 1992, the youngest case of the literature of torsion of wandering spleen at two days of birth was reported in Lebanon, by Dr Edouard Sayad.[9]"

    "Disease": "Weaver syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Children with Weaver syndrome tend to look similar and have distinctive physical and craniofacial characteristics, which may include several, but not all, of the following features: [6]\nOther features may include loose skin, thin deep-set nails, thin hair, short ribs, limited elbow and knee extension, camptodactyly, and a coarse, low-pitched voice. Delayed development of motor skills such as sitting, standing, and walking are commonly exhibited in early childhood. Patients with Weaver syndrome typically have mild intellectual disability with poor coordination and balance.[7] They also have some neurological abnormalities such as speech delay, epilepsy, intellectual disability, hypotonia or hypertonia, and behavioral problems.[citation needed]",
    "Causes": "The cause for Weaver syndrome was identified in 2011 as autosomal dominant mutations in the EZH2 gene on chromosome 7q36.[2] EZH2 (Enhancer of Zeste, Drosophila, homolog 2) is the second histone methyltransferase associated with human overgrowth. It encodes the catalytic component of the PRC2 protein complex (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2), which regulates chromatin structure and gene expression, and has been found to repress transcription. EZH2 also has critical roles in stem cell maintenance and cell lineage determination, such as osteogenesis, myogenesis, lymphopoiesis and hematopoiesis.\nIt can also be associated with mutations in the histone methyltransferase NSD1 gene on chromosome 5q35. The functions of NSD1 are not clearly known, but it is thought to act as a factor in influencing transcription, which contains domains involved in chromatin-mediated regulation during development.[8]\nMost cases are found to be sporadic, with no family history of the syndrome, although there have been a few cases in families where autosomal dominant inheritance has been reported.[9]",
    "Diagnosis": "Weaver syndrome and Sotos syndrome are often mistaken for one another due to their significant phenotypic overlap and similarities.[10] Clinical features shared by both syndromes include overgrowth in early development, advanced bone age, developmental delay, and prominent macrocephaly.[11] Mutations in the NSD1 gene may also be another cause for confusion. The NSD1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in normal growth and development. Deletions and mutations in the NSD1 gene is a common cause for patients with Sotos syndrome and in some cases for Weaver syndrome as well. [6]\nFeatures distinguishing Weaver syndrome from Sotos syndrome include broad forehead and face, ocular hypertelorism, prominent wide philtrum, micrognathia, deep-set nails, retrognathia with a prominent chin crease, increased prenatal growth, and a carpal bone age that is greatly advanced compared to metacarpal and phalangeal bone age.[12]",
    "Treatment": "There is no cure available for Weaver syndrome. However, with multidisciplinary management, such as neurological, pediatric, orthopedic and psychomotor care and genetic counseling, symptoms can be managed. Surgery may be used to correct any skeletal issues. Physical and occupational therapy are considered an option to help with muscle tone. Also, speech therapy is often recommended for speech related problems.[medical citation needed]",
    "Prognosis": "With appropriate treatment and management, patients with Weaver syndrome appear to do well, both physically and intellectually, throughout their life and have a normal lifespan.[medical citation needed] Their adult height can reach 7–8 feet (213.36–243.84 cm).[13]",
    "Epidemiology": "The incidence of Weaver syndrome is uncertain, as the causative mutation was only identified in 2011. As of December 2013[update], 48 cases of Weaver syndrome had been documented and confirmed.[3][14] In 2012, the South West Thames Regional Genetic Service at St George's Hospital in London, based on their detection rate among a cohort of patients within their Childhood Overgrowth Study, estimated a prevalence rate similar to that of Sotos syndrome, around 1 in 15,000.[4]"

    "Disease": "Wilson%27s disease",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The main sites of copper accumulation are the liver and brain. Consequently, liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms are the main features that lead to diagnosis.[5] People with liver problems tend to come for medical attention earlier (generally as children or teenagers) than those with neurological and psychiatric symptoms, who tend to be in their 20s or older. Some are identified only because relatives have been diagnosed with Wilson's disease; many of these, when tested, turn out to have been experiencing symptoms of the condition but have not received a diagnosis.[6]\nLiver disease may present itself as tiredness, jaundice, increased bleeding tendency or confusion (due to hepatic encephalopathy), and portal hypertension.[7] The last, a condition in which the pressure in the portal vein is markedly increased, leads to esophageal varices (distended veins in the esophagus that may bleed in a life-threatening fashion) as well as enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) and accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites). On examination, signs of chronic liver disease such as spider angiomata (small distended blood vessels, usually on the chest) may be observed. Chronic active hepatitis has already caused cirrhosis of the liver in most patients by the time they develop symptoms. While most people with cirrhosis have an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), this risk is relatively low in Wilson's disease.[5]\nAbout 5% of all people are diagnosed only when they develop fulminant acute liver failure, often in the context of hemolytic anemia (anemia due to the destruction of red blood cells). This leads to abnormalities in protein production (identified by deranged coagulation) and metabolism by the liver. The deranged protein metabolism leads to the accumulation of waste products, such as ammonia, in the bloodstream. When these irritate the brain, patients develop hepatic encephalopathy – a serious condition that causes confusion, coma, seizures and, finally, life-threatening swelling of the brain).[5]\nAbout half of the people with Wilson's disease have neurological or psychiatric symptoms. Most initially have mild cognitive deterioration and clumsiness, as well as changes in behavior. Specific neurological symptoms usually then follow, often in the form of parkinsonism (lead-pipe or cogwheel rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability[8]) with or without a typical hand tremor, masked facial expressions, slurred speech, ataxia (lack of coordination), or dystonia (twisting and repetitive movements of part of the body). Seizures and migraine appear to be more common in Wilson's disease.[5] A characteristic tremor described as \"wing-beating tremor\" is encountered in many people with Wilson's; this is absent at rest but can be provoked by abducting the arms and flexing the elbows toward the midline.[9]\nCognition can also be affected in Wilson's disease, in two non-mutually exclusive categories: frontal lobe disorder (may present as impulsivity, impaired judgement, promiscuity, apathy, and executive dysfunction with poor planning and decision-making) and subcortical dementia (may present as slow thinking, memory loss, and executive dysfunction, without signs of aphasia, apraxia, or agnosia). These cognitive involvements are thought to be related and closely linked to psychiatric manifestations of the disease.[8]\nPsychiatric problems due to Wilson's disease may include behavioral changes, depression, anxiety disorders, and psychosis.[5] Psychiatric symptoms are commonly seen in conjunction with neurological symptoms and are rarely manifested on their own. These symptoms are often poorly defined and can sometimes be attributed to other causes. Because of this, diagnosis of Wilson's disease is rarely made when only psychiatric symptoms are present.[8]\nMedical conditions have been linked with copper accumulation in Wilson's disease:",
    "Diagnosis": "Wilson's disease may be suspected on the basis of any of the symptoms mentioned above, or when a close relative has been found to have Wilson's. Most have slightly abnormal liver function tests such as raised aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and bilirubin levels. Alkaline phosphatase levels are relatively low in those with Wilson's-related acute liver failure.[20] If the liver damage is significant, albumin may be decreased due to an inability of damaged liver cells to produce this protein; likewise, the prothrombin time (a test of coagulation) may be prolonged as the liver is unable to produce proteins known as clotting factors.[5] If neurological symptoms are seen, magnetic resonance imaging  of the brain is usually performed; this shows hyperintensities in the part of the brain called the basal ganglia in the T2 setting.[14] MRI may also demonstrate the characteristic \"face of the giant panda\" pattern.[21]\nNo totally reliable test for Wilson's disease is known, but levels of ceruloplasmin and copper in the blood, as well of the amount of copper excreted in urine during a 24-hour period, are together used to form an impression of the amount of copper in the body. The most accurate test is a liver biopsy.[5]\nLevels of ceruloplasmin are abnormally low (<0.2 g/L) in 80–95% of cases.[5]  It can be present at normal levels, though, in people with ongoing inflammation, as it is an acute phase protein. Low ceruloplasmin is also found in Menkes disease and aceruloplasminemia, which are related to, but much rarer than Wilson's disease.[5][14] The combination of neurological symptoms, eye signs, and a low ceruloplasmin level is considered sufficient for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. In many cases, however, further tests are needed.[14]\nSerum copper is low, which may seem paradoxical given that Wilson's disease is a disease of copper excess. However, 95% of plasma copper is carried by ceruloplasmin, which is often low in Wilson's disease. Urine copper is elevated in Wilson's disease and is collected for 24 hours in a bottle with a copper-free liner. Levels above 100 μg/24h (1.6 μmol/24h) confirm Wilson's disease, and levels above 40 μg/24h (0.6 μmol/24h) are strongly indicative.[5] High urine copper levels are not unique to Wilson's disease; they are sometimes observed in autoimmune hepatitis and in cholestasis (any disease obstructing the flow of bile from the liver to the small bowel).[14]\nIn children, the following penicillamine test may be used: a 500 mg oral dose of penicillamine is administered, and all urine collected for 24 hours. If the entire day's urine contains more than 1600 μg (25 μmol) of copper, it is a reliable indicator of Wilson's disease. This test has not been validated in adults.[14]\nThe eyes of the patient are examined using a slit lamp to look for Kayser–Fleischer rings, which are strongly associated with Wilson's disease and are caused by copper deposition on the inner cornea in Descemet's membrane.[10]\nOnce other investigations have indicated Wilson's disease, the ideal test is the removal of a small amount of liver tissue through a liver biopsy. This is assessed microscopically for the degree of steatosis and cirrhosis, and histochemistry and quantification of copper are used to measure the severity of the copper accumulation. A level of 250 μg of copper per gram of dried liver tissue confirms Wilson's disease. Occasionally, lower levels of copper are found; in that case, the combination of the biopsy findings with all other tests could still lead to a formal diagnosis of Wilson's.[5]\nIn the earlier stages of the disease, the biopsy typically shows steatosis (deposition of fatty material), increased glycogen in the nucleus, and areas of necrosis (cell death). In more advanced disease, the changes observed are quite similar to those seen in autoimmune hepatitis, such as infiltration by inflammatory cells, piecemeal necrosis, and fibrosis (scar tissue). In advanced disease, finally, cirrhosis is the main finding. In acute liver failure, degeneration of the liver cells and collapse of the liver tissue architecture is seen, typically on a background of cirrhotic changes. Histochemical methods for detecting copper are inconsistent and unreliable, and taken alone are regarded as insufficient to establish a diagnosis.[14]\nMutation analysis of the ATP7B gene, as well as other genes linked to copper accumulation in the liver, may be performed. Once a mutation is confirmed, family members can be screened for the disease as part of clinical genetics family counseling.[5] Regional distributions of genes associated with Wilson's disease are important to follow, as this can help clinicians design appropriate screening strategies. Since mutations of the ATP7B gene vary between populations, research and genetic testing done in countries such as the USA or United Kingdom can pose problems, as they tend to have more mixed populations.[22]",
    "Treatment": "In general, a diet low in copper-containing foods is recommended. High-copper foods avoided in Wilson's disease include mushrooms, nuts, chocolate, dried fruit, liver, sesame seeds, sesame oil, and shellfish.[5]\nMedical treatments are available for Wilson's disease. Some increase the removal of copper from the body, while others prevent the absorption of copper from the diet.\nGenerally, penicillamine is the first treatment used. This binds to copper (by chelation) and leads to excretion of copper in the urine. Hence, monitoring of the amount of copper in the urine can be done to ensure a sufficiently high dose is taken. Penicillamine is not without problems; about 20% experience a side effect or complication of penicillamine treatment, such as drug-induced lupus (causing joint pains and a skin rash) or myasthenia (a nerve condition leading to muscle weakness). In those who presented with neurological symptoms, almost half experience a paradoxical worsening in their symptoms. While this phenomenon is observed in other treatments for Wilson's, it is usually taken as an indication for discontinuing penicillamine and commencing second-line treatment.[5][14] Those intolerant to penicillamine may instead be commenced on trientine hydrochloride, which also has chelating properties. Some recommend trientine as first-line treatment, but experience with penicillamine is more extensive.[14] A further agent with known activity in Wilson's disease, under clinical investigation by Wilson Therapeutics, is tetrathiomolybdate. It is regarded as experimental,[14] though some studies have shown a beneficial effect.[5]\nOnce all results have returned to normal, zinc (usually in the form of a zinc acetate prescription called Galzin) may be used instead of chelators to maintain stable copper levels in the body. Zinc stimulates metallothionein, a protein in gut cells that binds copper and prevents its absorption and transport to the liver. Zinc therapy is continued unless symptoms recur or if the urinary excretion of copper increases.[14]\nIn rare cases where none of the oral treatments is effective, especially with severe neurological disease, dimercaprol (British anti-Lewisite) is occasionally necessary. This treatment is injected intramuscularly (into a muscle) every few weeks and has unpleasant side effects such as pain.[23]\nPeople who are asymptomatic (for instance, those diagnosed through family screening or only as a result of abnormal test results) are generally treated, as the copper accumulation may cause long-term damage in the future. Whether these people are best treated with penicillamine or zinc acetate is unclear.[14]\nPhysiotherapy and occupational therapy are beneficial for patients with the neurological form of the disease. The copper-chelating treatment may take up to six months to start working, and these therapies can assist in coping with ataxia, dystonia, and tremors, as well as preventing the development of contractures that can result from dystonia.[24]\nLiver transplantation is an effective cure for Wilson's disease, but is used only in particular scenarios because of the risks and complications associated with the procedure. It is used mainly in people with fulminant liver failure who fail to respond to medical treatment or in those with advanced chronic liver disease. Liver transplantation is avoided in severe neuropsychiatric illnesses, in which its benefit has not been demonstrated.[5][14]",
    "Prognosis": "Left untreated, Wilson's disease tends to become progressively worse and is eventually fatal. Serious complications include liver cirrhosis, acute kidney failure, and psychosis. Liver cancer and cholangiocarcinoma may occur, but at a lower incidence than other chronic liver diseases, and the risk is greatly reduced with treatment.[13] With early detection and treatment, most of those affected can live relatively normal lives and have a life expectancy close to that of the general population.[13] Liver and neurological damage that occurs prior to treatment may improve, but is often permanent.[25] Fertility is usually normal and pregnancy complications are not increased in those with Wilson's disease that is treated.[13]"

    "Disease": "Wiskott%E2%80%93Aldrich syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "WAS occurs most often in males due to its X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance, affecting between 1 and 10 males per million.[1] The first signs are usually petechiae and bruising, resulting from a low platelet count (i.e. thrombocytopenia). Spontaneous nose bleeds and bloody diarrhea are also common and eczema typically develops within the first month of life. Recurrent bacterial infections typically develop by three months of age. The majority of children with WAS develop at least one autoimmune disorder, and cancers (mainly lymphoma and leukemia) develop in up to a third of patients.[3] Immunoglobulin M (IgM) levels are reduced, IgA and IgE are elevated, and IgG levels can be normal, reduced, or elevated.[4] In addition to thrombocytopenia, WAS patients have abnormally small platelets (i.e. microthrombocytes) and ~30% also have elevated eosinophil  counts (i.e. eosinophilia).[5]",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis can be made on the basis of clinical findings, the peripheral blood smear, and low immunoglobulin levels. Typically, IgM levels are low, IgA levels are elevated, and IgE levels may be elevated; paraproteins are occasionally observed.[15] Skin immunologic testing (allergy testing) may reveal hyposensitivity. Individuals with Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome however are at higher risk for severe food allergies.[16] Not all patients have a positive family history of the disorder; new mutations do occur. Often, leukemia may be suspected on the basis of low platelets and infections, and bone marrow biopsy may be performed. Decreased levels of WASp are typically observed. The current gold standard for diagnosis is DNA sequence analysis, which can detect WAS and the related disorders XLT and XLN in 95% of patients and carriers.[17]\nJin et al. (2004) employ a numerical grading of severity:[12] This score, which ranges from 0 to 5, may have clinical utility for predicting disease severity.[20] Those with higher WAS scores (e.g., 5) at younger ages (e.g., age less than 5 years old), are thought to be at highest risk for increased morbidity and mortality related to their condition.[21] As individuals can develop more WAS-related symptoms (e.g. autoimmune disease, malignancy) with age, one's WAS score can increase over time. A lower WAS score may be more compatible with conservative management versus higher WAS scores that may favor intervention with treatments such as hematopoietic stem cell transplant.[citation needed]",
    "Treatment": "Hematopoietic stem cell transplant\nTreatment of Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome depends on the severity of the disease. WAS is primarily a disorder of the blood-forming tissues, so in cases of severe disease (WAS score 3–5) the only widely available curative treatment currently available is a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT). In this procedure stem cells are harvested from umbilical cord blood, bone marrow, or peripheral blood following treatment with medications that cause stem cells to leave the bone marrow and circulate systemically. The best outcomes are with HLA-identical or similar donors (often siblings). In cases of milder disease the potential benefits of HCT (>90% probability of cure if transplant occurs before age two) must be considered in the context of non-trivial risks presented by the procedure itself and the potential need for lifelong immunosuppression to prevent graft-versus-host disease.[22][23] Generally outcomes are better if HCT occurs prior to the development of autoimmune disease or malignancy, however there are risks associated with chemotherapy (needed to make room for the new stem cells) especially in young infants (risk of a second cancer, or infertility).[citation needed]\nBleeding complications\nOtherwise WAS treatment is focused on managing symptoms and preventing complications. The greatest mortality risk in WAS before age 30 is from bleeding so aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that may interfere with already compromised platelet function should generally be avoided.[13] Circumcision, as well as elective surgeries, should generally be deferred in males with thrombocytopenia until after HCT if possible. Protective helmets can help protect children from life-threatening intracranial hemorrhage (brain bleed) which could result from head injuries.  Patients may require platelet transfusions when there is extreme bloodloss (such as during surgery) or for very low platelets splenectomy (removal of the spleen) may also be lifesaving.[24] However, splenectomy is generally considered palliative and is not universally recommended in WAS because it can increase the risk of life-threatening infections.[25][13] Post-splenectomy patients will require lifelong antibiotic prophyllaxis to prevent infections. Study of eltrombopag, a thrombopoietic agent used to increase platelets in immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), in WAS concluded that although it increased platelet numbers it failed to increase platelet activation in most patients.[26] It has since been proposed the eltrombopag may be used to bridge to HCT in patients with severe thrombocytopenia to normalize platelet numbers without transfusions and decrease bleeding events.[27] Anemia from bleeding may require iron supplementation or blood transfusion. Regular surveillance of blood counts is recommended.\nInfections and autoimmune disease\nFor patients with frequent infections, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) or subcutaneous immunoglobulins can be regularly scheduled to boost the immune system. Adequacy of IVIG replacement can be assessed via periodic lab draws. WAS patients with immune system compromise may benefit from antibiotic prophylaxis, for example by taking trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent Pneumocystis jirovecii-related pneumonia. Similarly, prophylactic antibiotic use may also be considered in patients with recurrent bacterial sinus or lung infections. When there are signs or symptoms of an infection, prompt and thorough evaluation is important including blood cultures to guide therapy (often IV antibiotics). Live vaccines (such as MMR or rotavirus) should be avoided during routine childhood vaccination. Inactivated vaccines may be given safely but may not provide protective levels of immunity. Eczema is generally treated with topical steroids, and if chronic skin infections exacerbate eczema an antibiotic may also be given. Autoimmune disease is managed with judicious use of appropriate immunosuppressants.[citation needed]\nGene therapy\nFor severely affected males without an HLA-matched donor, studies of correcting Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome with gene therapy using a lentivirus are underway.[28][29] Proof-of-principle for successful hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy has been provided for patients with Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome.[30] In July 2013 the Italian San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (HSR-TIGET) reported that three children with Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome showed significant improvement (improved platelet counts, immune functiona, and clinical symptoms) 20–30 months after being treated with a genetically modified lentivirus.[31] In April 2015 results from a follow-up British and French trial six out of seven individuals showed improvement of immune function and clinical symptoms an average of 27 months after treatment with gene therapy.[32][33][34] Importantly, neither study showed evidence of leukemic proliferation following treatment, a complication of early attempts at gene therapy using a retroviral vector.[35] It is unknown why these gene therapies did not restore normal platelet numbers, but gene therapy treatment was still associated with transfusion-independence and a significant reduction in bleeding events.[31][32] A version of this treatment, OTL-103, is being developed by Orchard Therapeutics and (as of 28 June 2021[update]) is undergoing Phase I/II clinical trials.",
    "Prognosis": "Outcomes from Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome are variable and depend on how severely an individual is affected (the WAS score may be used to assess disease severity). The milder end of the disease spectrum associated with the WAS gene is referred to as X-linked neutropenia or X-linked thrombocytopenia, and the latter is thought to have a normal life expectancy with reports of minimally affected males surviving into their seventh decade without treatment.[20] Traditionally however Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome has been associated with premature death from causes including bleeding, infections, or malignancy.[36] Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome is a condition with variable expressivity, meaning that even within the same family some may exhibit only chronic thrombocytopenia while others experience severe, life-threatening complications of Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome in infancy or childhood.[37][13] Given symptoms often progress with age, it is challenging to predict how affected a newly diagnosed infant will eventually be. There is some genotype-phenotype correlation, with most individuals with X-linked thrombocytopenia having missense variants in the WAS gene versus 86.5% of those that make no WAS protein having the classic Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome phenotype.[38][39] Overall the prognosis for individuals with Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome has improved considerably over the past decades due to earlier diagnoses and more access to treatments.",
    "Epidemiology": "The estimated incidence of Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome in the United States is one in 250,000 live male births.[40] While still a rare disease, this makes it more common than many genetic immunodeficiency syndromes such as hyper-IgM syndrome or SCID, which have an estimated incidence of about one in 1,000,000 live births, and Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome is thought to account for 1.2% of all inherited immunodeficiencies in the United States.[41] WAS occurs worldwide and is not known to be more common in any particular ethnic group."

    "Disease": "Wolfram syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The first symptom is typically diabetes mellitus, which is usually diagnosed around the age of 6. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus associate with Wolfram syndrome is differed from type 1 diabetes mellitus by having earlier diagnosis, rarely having positive auto-antibodies and ketoacidosis, having longer remission, needing less daily insulin, having lower average HbA1c level and more frequent hypoglycemia.[8]\nThe second most common clinical manifestation of the disease is diabetes insipidus, which the kidney is unable to retain water due to renal outflow tract dilation and leads to high level of urine production.[9][10][11] This condition affects around 70% of people with WSF1 mutation (WFS2 mutation does not typically associate with diabetes insipidus).[8][12] Diabetes insipidus occurs around the age of 14, but the condition is often diagnosed late. Therefore, there is a high variability in the onset age.[8]\nThe next symptom to appear is often optic atrophy, optical shrinkage that due to retinal ganglion cell axons' degeneration, around the age of 11. Blindness tends to develop a few years after the decrease in visual ability with the loss of color vision.[8] Ophthalmic abnormalities often found in the patient with Wolfram Syndrome are cataract, nystagmus, glaucoma and maculopathy. There is also pigmentary retinopathy due to mitochondrial alteration that associated with Wolfram Syndrome. However, it is very rare and have been found in just a few cases.[8]\nApproximately 65% of people with Wolfram syndrome experience sensorineural deafness, which can manifest as deafness at birth or mild hearing loss in adolescent years and progressively worsen.[2] However, the progression of sensorineural deafness is relatively slow and initially influences high-frequency sounds. Patients with WFS1 mutation have degenerative impairment in the central nervous system, as they increased in age they are more likely to suffer a more severe deafness than other patients that have hearing loss.[3][8]\nThe majority of people (>60%) with WSF1 mutation develop neurological symptoms around the age of 40; however, some may experience these symptoms earlier in life. Some of the most common neurological abnormalities are cerebellar ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, epilepsy, cognitive impairment, dysphagia, dysarthria and diminished sense of taste and smell. In addition, the patient can also experienced orthostatic hypotension, gastroparesis, hypothermia or hyperthermia, hypohidrosis or hyperhidrosis, constipation and headache.[3][12][8] Furthermore, there are also cases in which patients also have severe depression, sleep abnormalities, psychosis and physical aggression. The occurrence of the above conditions can add complexity to the clinical presentation of Wolfram syndrome.[8]\nUrinary tract disorders are also found in more than 90% patient with Wolfram Syndrome, in which neurogenic bladder is the main manifestation of neurological disorder that can lead to urinary incontinence, hydroureter and recurrent infections. Recurrent UTIs are one of the most prevalent clinical challenges associated with Wolfram syndrome. These urological abnormalities usually onset at the age of 20 and can peak at 13, 21 and 33 years of age.[3][8] Furthermore, bladder dysfunction can progress over time.[12]\nEndocrine dysfunction is another clinical manifestation of Wolfram syndrome, which include hypogonadism. More specifically, hypogonadism presents more frequent in male than female. Male patients are more likely to experience fertility impairment and erectile dysfunction, while female patients may encounter menstrual abnormalities. Additionally, due to the decrease in function of the anterior pituitary gland, patients with Wolfram syndrome can also have short statue, growth hormone deficiency and corticotrophin secretion deficiency.[2][8][13] Since patient with Wolfram syndrome can experienced diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus and urinary tract disorder, they are treated with desmopressin, which can lead to the development of hyponatremia.[2]\nOther abnormalities associated with Wolfram syndrome include gastrointestinal disorders (gastroparesis and bowel incontinence) and heart disease. These disorders have been reported in rare cases of WFS1 mutation.[8]",
    "Causes": "Wolfram syndrome was initially thought to be caused by mitochondrial dysfunction due to several reports of mitochondrial DNA mutations. However, it has now been established that Wolfram syndrome is caused by a congenital endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dysfunction.[2]\nTwo forms have been described: Wolfram syndrome 1 (WFS1), and Wolfram syndrome 2 (WFS2).[2]\nThe WFS1 or wolframin gene provides instructions for making the wolframin protein.[2] The WFS1 gene is active in cells throughout the body, with strong activity in the heart, brain, lungs, inner ear, and pancreas. The pancreas provides enzymes that help digest food, and it also produces the hormone insulin. Insulin controls how much glucose (a type of sugar) is passed from the blood into cells for conversion to energy.[14]\nWithin cells, wolframin is located the endoplasmic reticulum. Among its many activities, the endoplasmic reticulum folds and modifies newly formed proteins so they have the correct 3-dimensional shape to function properly. The endoplasmic reticulum also helps transport proteins, fats, and other materials to specific sites within the cell or to the cell surface. The function of wolframin is unknown. Based on its location in the endoplasmic reticulum, however, it may play a role in protein folding or cellular transport. In the pancreas, wolframin may help fold a protein precursor of insulin (called proinsulin) into the mature hormone that controls blood glucose levels. Research findings also suggest that wolframin may help maintain the correct cellular level of charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) by controlling how much is stored in the endoplasmic reticulum. In the inner ear, wolframin may help maintain the proper levels of calcium ions or other charged particles that are essential for hearing.[15] Mutation in the WFS1 lead to ER stress due to an increase in the accumulation of misfolded proteins. As there is a high level of misfolded protein, unfolded protein response (UPR) is stimulated and lead to transcriptional and translational process that can restore ER homeostasis, However, if the ER stress is present persistently due to physiological or pathophysiological events, the UPR will induce apoptosis.[8]\nMore than 30 WFS1 mutations have been identified in individuals with a form of nonsyndromic deafness (hearing loss without related signs and symptoms affecting other parts of the body) called DFNA6. Individuals with DFNA6 deafness cannot hear low tones (low-frequency sounds), such as a tuba or the \"m\" in moon. DFNA6 hearing loss is unlike most forms of nonsyndromic deafness that affect high tones (high-frequency sounds), such as birds chirping, or all frequencies of sound. Most WFS1 mutations replace one of the protein building blocks (amino acids) used to make wolframin with an incorrect amino acid. One mutation deletes an amino acid from wolframin. WFS1 mutations probably alter the 3-dimensional shape of wolframin, which could affect its function. Because the function of wolframin is unknown, however, it is unclear how WFS1 mutations cause hearing loss. Some researchers suggest that altered wolframin disturbs the balance of charged particles in the inner ear, which interferes with the hearing process.[16]\nMutations in the WFS1 gene cause Wolfram syndrome. Researchers have identified more than 100 WFS1 mutations that cause Wolfram syndrome. Some mutations delete or insert DNA from the WFS1 gene. As a result, little or no wolframin is present in cells. Other mutations replace one of the protein building blocks (amino acids) used to make wolframin with an incorrect amino acid. These mutations appear to reduce wolframin activity dramatically. Researchers suggest that the loss of wolframin disrupts the production of insulin, which leads to poor glucose control and diabetes mellitus. It is unclear how WFS1 mutations lead to other features of Wolfram syndrome.\nWolfram Syndrome Type 2 (WFS2) is a subtype of Wolfram Syndrome caused by a mutation in the CDGSH iron-sulfur domain-containing protein 2 gene (CISD2 gene). CISD2 is a protein coding gene that is primarily found on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), though some studies have shown that it can also be localized in the mitochondrial outer membrane. Mutation of this gene effects the protein folding of the ER and functions of the mitochondria, which leads to the signs and symptoms seen in those with WFS2. In some cases, mutation of the gene can lead to premature aging, mitophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction. In studies using mice, WFS2 caused a decrease in ER Ca2+ and increase in mitochondrial Ca2+. This causes an increase in stress to the ER and activates an unfolded protein response (UPR). Further studies are still needed to better understand WFS2 and the neurodegenerative effects it has.[17][18][19]\nClinical features of both WFS1 and WFS2 are diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy/neuropathy, sensorineural deafness, and  genitourinary problems. Although both types have some overlapping symptoms, there are some differences that help us distinguish between the two. One of the main ones is that WFS2, it is not associated with diabetes insipidus or psychiatric disorders but is instead associated with higher bleed risks and peptic ulcers.[12]\nCISD2 gene consists of 3 exons on chromosome 4q24, which encodes the protein NAF-1 (nutrient deprivation autophagy factor-1). Therefore, if WFS2 were suspected in a patient, it may help to do a gene sequencing of the three exons and their intronic regions for a genetic analysis.[20]\nWFS2 is the rarest and most recently discovered subtype of Wolfram syndrome.",
    "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of Wolfram syndrome is multifaceted, involving clinical evaluation, genetic testing, laboratory investigations, and imaging studies. Clinical evaluation typically begins with a detailed medical history and physical examination, where patients often present with juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus followed by progressive optic atrophy, a condition where the optic nerves, which connect the eyes to the brain, deteriorate over time, leading to vision loss.[9] There is increased suspicion when diabetes is diagnosed in children under 16. More evidence shows that Wolfram syndrome varies in how it appears.\nThe syndrome can present with various symptoms. In addition to diabetes and optic atrophy, the patient may exhibit diabetes insipidus, a condition where the kidneys cannot retain water, leading to frequent urination and excessive thirst. They might also have sensorineural hearing loss, which is a type of hearing loss caused by damage to the inner ear or the nerves that connect the ear to the brain. Neurological abnormalities such as ataxia (lack of muscle coordination) or myoclonus (sudden, involuntary muscle jerks) may also be observed.[25] The progression of symptoms, starting with type 1 diabetes and subsequent vision loss within the first decade of life, is a critical diagnostic clue.[26]\nImaging studies are essential for understanding the extent of brain and optic nerve damage in Wolfram syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can show significant shrinkage of the brain stem and cerebellum, region of the brain in motor control and coordination. These change can resemble changes seen in other neurodegenerative disorders, which are diseases that involve the progressive loss of structure or function of neurons, including death of neurons.[27] Additionally, areas of the pons, part of the brainstem, may show increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images, indicating potential damage or changes in tissue composition. The connections between the cerebellum and the brainstem (middle cerebellar peduncles) can also exhibit atrophy, consistent with Wolfram syndrome. Changes in the optic radiations, which are the pathways transmitting visual information from the eyes to the brain, can be detected, aligning with the optic atrophy characteristic of Wolfram syndrome. Furthermore, the absence of the typical T1 hyperintensity in the posterior pituitary lobe suggests a lack of vasopressin-containing neurons, often linked with diabetes insipidus, another symptom of Wolfram syndrome. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is used to measure retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, aiding in the assessment of optic atrophy and monitoring disease progression.\nNowadays, genetic testing is used commonly to confirm the diagnosis of Wolfram syndrome. Initially, people with hereditary optic neuropathy who tested negative for mutation in the common optic neuropathy genes OPA1, OPA3 and LHON were selected for further genetic testing for WS. The primary genetic lotus associated with this syndrome is WFS1, and Sanger sequencing of this gene typically confirms the diagnosis.[28] Most patient exhibit recessive mutation in WFS1, meaning they inherited two copies of the mutated genes, one from each parents. However, some dominant mutation, such as H313Y, have been identified, where one copy of the mutated gene can cause the disorder.[29] These dominant mutations are often linked to low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, which affects the ability to hear low-pitched sounds. Additionally, there have been recent discoveries of autosomal dominant diabetes, where diabetes is inherited in a dominant manner, in patients with WFS1 mutations. Interpreting genetic testing results requires specialized knowledge due to the complexity of the mutation.[30]\nDetailed family history is important as WS2 inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, and genetic counseling is recommended for affected individuals and their families to understand the inheritance pattern, risks to other family members, and reproductive options.[31] A minority of patients have recessive mutation in the CISD2 (WFS2) gene, and for those without WFS1 mutations, Sanger sequencing of WFS2 is conducted.[32] Efforts are underway to develop diagnosis methods based on exome (sequencing all the protein-coding regions of the genes) and genome sequencing (sequencing the entire genetic code) for Wolfram syndrome and related disorder.[33]\nOther diagnostic tools include audiological tests to identify sensorineural hearing loss, a common feature of Wolfram syndrome, and psychiatric evaluations to address cognitive or behavioral issues arising from neurodegenerative nature of the disease. Audiological tests help assess the extent of hearing loss and guide interventions like hearing aids or other assistive devices. Psychiatric evaluations are important because the neurological aspects of Wolfram syndrome can lead to cognitive decline or behavioral changes, which require appropriate management and support. [34]",
    "Treatment": "There is no known direct treatment. Current treatment efforts focus on managing the complications of Wolfram syndrome. Intranasal or oral desmopressin has been shown to improve symptoms for the treatment of diabetes insipidus caused by Wolfram syndrome.[8] Patients with Wolfram syndrome experiencing hearing loss have benefited from the use of cochlear implants and hearing aids.[35] While there are no therapies currently available to slow the progression of neurological manifestations, swallowing therapy and esophagomyotomy have been shown to be useful in alleviating some of the neurological symptoms.[36] Anticholinergic medications, clean intermittent catheterizations, electrical stimulation, and physiotherapy have been shown to be effective at managing urological abnormalities due to Wolfram syndrome such as neurogenic bladder and upper urinary tract dilation.[37]\nWhile there are no direct treatments, many therapies are currently being investigated for their efficacy at treating Wolfram syndrome. Gene and regenerative therapies are currently being studied for their efficacy in replacing damaged tissues due to Wolfram syndrome, such as pancreatic β-cells, neuronal, and retinal cells.[38]\nWFS1 mutations cause proteins in the ER to fold improperly, leading to ER stress. ER stress stimulates the unfolded protein response (UPR), which causes cell apoptosis for pancreatic β-cells.[39] Chemical chaperones are being investigated for their effect on reducing the UPR response and thus delaying disease progression by preventing cell death.[8]  The FDA has approved 4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA) and tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) as chemical chaperones to reduce ER stress to delay neurodegeneration in patients with Wolfram syndrome.[40] As of 2023, sodium valproate—an anti-epileptic drug—is being investigated as a therapy for Wolfram syndrome due to studies showing its ability to inhibit ER stress-induced apoptosis, reducing neurodegeneration.[41] Liraglutide—a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP 1-R) agonist—has been hypothesized to be an effective therapy, as it has been shown to improve diabetes mellitus, reduce cell death due to ER stress, reduce neuroinflammation, protect retinal ganglion cell death, and prevent optic nerve degeneration.[42]  Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors have also been hypothesized to be efficacious in the treatment of Wolfram syndrome due to their ability to activate GLP 1-R, similar to liraglutide.[43]  However, the efficacy and safety of using liraglutide and DPP-4 inhibitors for the treatment of Wolfram syndrome has not been well studied yet.\nER calcium levels have also been identified as a target for Wolfram syndrome therapy. WFS1 mutations increase cytosolic calcium, leading to the activation of cysteine proteases known as calpains. Increased calpains activation is associated which cell death.[44] As of 2021, dantrolene sodium—a medication indicated for the treatment of malignant hyperthermia and muscle spasms—was being investigated in patients with Wolfram syndrome in a phase 2 clinical trial.[45]",
    "Prognosis": "Wolfram Syndrome prognosis is very poor with a median mortality rate of 65% before the age of 35 (age range 25–39).[13] The two main reasons for death in people with Wolfram syndrome are central respiratory failure due to severe neurological disability and renal failure secondary to infections.[46][47] Currently, there is no effective treatment that can delay or reverse the progression of the disease.[47]",
    "Epidemiology": "Wolfram syndrome is considered a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease. According to the draft International Classification of Disease (ICD-11), Wolfram syndrome is classified as a rare specified diabetes mellitus.[2] The disease is estimated to affect 1 in 160,000 to 770,00.[2][21] More specifically, the disease prevalence is 1 in 770,00 in the UK, 1 in 710,000 in Japan, 1 in 100,00 in North America, 0.74 in 1,000,000 in Italy, 1 in 68,000 in Lebanon and the highest prevalence is 1 in 54,478 in a small area of Sicily (Italy).[3][8][9] It is believed that the populations with high prevalence have high-rate of consanguinity.[22][23] The frequency of WSF1 mutation carrier is estimated to be 1 in 354 in the UK population and the disease is estimated to affect 1 out of 150 patient with juvenile-onset insulin-independent diabetes mellitus.[24]"

One of the common themes in films about XP is whether teens with XP will risk sun exposure in pursuit of a romantic partner.[30]\nFilm series like Children of Darkness, a German silent-drama film which was released in two parts in the year of 1921 and 1922 respectively, were among some of the initially popular movies that were made about XP.[citation needed]\nOther films, like the 1964 American drama film Della, starring Joan Crawford, Paul Burke, Charles Bickford and Diane Baker, directed by Robert Gist, which was originally produced by Four Star Television as a television pilot for a proposed NBC series named Royal Bay, was also based on this skin disease.[citation needed]\nThe Dark Side of the Sun, a 1988 American-Yugoslavian drama film, was directed by Božidar Nikolić and stars Brad Pitt for his first ever leading role as a young man in search of a cure for his disorder.[citation needed]\nThe Others, a 2001 American psychological horror film starring Nicole Kidman, features two children, Anne and Nicholas, who must avoid all sunlight because of a rare disease characterized by photosensitivity.[citation needed]\nA CBS television movie aired in 1994, Children of the Dark, was based on the story of the real-life couple Jim and Kim Harrison, whose two daughters have XP.[31][32]\nLurlene McDaniel's young adult book How I Do Love Thee features the story \"Night Vision\", in which the protagonist, leukemia survivor Brett, falls in love with a girl named Shayla that has XP.[citation needed]\nChristopher Snow, the protagonist of novelist Dean Koontz's Moonlight Bay Trilogy, has XP and therefore must live most of his life during the night. The first two entries of the trilogy, Fear Nothing and Seize the Night, were both published in 1998. The final entry in the trilogy, tentatively titled Ride the Storm, has yet to be published as of August 2020.[33][34]\nThe 2011 French drama film The Moon Child is based on a 13-year-old child with XP, which prevents him from exposing himself to daylight.\nThe 2012 documentary Sun Kissed explores the XP problem on the Navajo Indian Reservation, and links it to the genetic legacy of the Long Walk of the Navajo, when the Navajo people were forced to move to a new location.[35][36][37]\nThe 2016 Vietnamese romance drama Khúc hát mặt trời,  based on a 2006 Japanese film, A Song to the Sun, tells the story of a girl named Yến Phương with XP and the impact of her sickness on her life and relationships, following the story of Phương's accidental exposure to sunlight and subsequent neurological degeneration.[38]\nMidnight Sun (2018 film) is a 2018 American romantic drama film based on the 2006 Japanese film A Song to the Sun. The film was directed by Scott Speer and written by Eric Kirsten, and stars Bella Thorne, Patrick Schwarzenegger, and Rob Riggle.[citation needed]"

    "Disease": "Young%E2%80%93Simpson syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Ohdo syndrome, SBBYSS variant, typically occurs early in life, with most diagnoses occurring at birth or during infancy. Patients with SBBYSS variant of Ohdo syndrome are characterized with hyperthyroidism, heart defects, facial dysmorphism, hypotonia, mental retardation, and postnatal growth retardation.\nSource[8]\nUnderdeveloped patellae (kneecaps) are the most common skeletal symptom associated with the syndrome. Additionally, abnormally long thumbs and great toes as well as dental abnormalities are also common among patients. Joint stiffness involving the hips, knees, and ankles is common which impairs movement among patients. Polydactyly, camptodactyly, clinodactyly, brachydactyly, syndactyly, club feet, and abnormalities of the spine and/or ribs may affect patients with the syndrome.\nSource[9]\nFacial signs and symptoms are most distinguishable among patients of this syndrome. Patients with Ohdo syndrome, SBBYS syndrome are characterized to have non-expressive mask-life faces. Additionally, patients may have features such as broad nasal bridges, nose with rounded top, narrowing of the eye opening, and prominent cheeks. Patients with the syndrome may also have abnormalities of the lacrimal glands and may be born with an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate).\nSource[10]\nHeart malformations, ocular anomalies, and bilateral mixed hearing loss are often present in patients. Genital malformations such as cryptorchidism, hypospadias, clitoromegaly, and hypoplasia are common. In a smaller number of cases, thyroid agenesis, hypothyroidism, intestinal malrotation, and respiratory difficulties are present.",
    "Diagnosis": "Source[8]\nDiagnosis of Ohdo syndrome, SBBYS variant, is done through clinical examination, brain imaging, and molecular studies. The diagnosis of Ohdo Syndrome, SBBYS variant is based on:\nDiagnosis of Ohdo syndrome, SBBYS variant, is often confused with genitopatellar syndrome due to overlapping signs and symptoms. However, mask-like faces, blepharophimosis, and ptosis are symptoms that allow Ohdo syndrome, SBBYS variant, to be distinguished from genitopatellar syndrome. Nevertheless, there is difficulty in distinguishing between the two genetic disorders.\nOhdo syndrome, SBBYS variant was previously diagnosed through clinical examination. Symptoms such as mental retardation, facial dysmorphism, thyroid dysfunction, impaired intellectual development, etc. Additionally, tests such as diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and tractography of the brain were used to diagnose the disorder.",
    "Treatment": "Source[10]\nThere are currently no known treatments for Ohdo syndrome, SBBYS variant. Management of the syndrome includes regular follow-up based on current complications of the patient and requires specific examinations (pediatric, cardiological, audiometric, orthopedic, neuropsychiatric, ophthalmological, and genetic). Additionally, occupational, physical, speech, feeding, and educational therapy must be conducted depending on the needs of the patient.",
    "Epidemiology": "Cases of SBBYS are not caused by the parents affected genes however, they are affected by their own mutation on the KAT6B gene. If a doctor does suspect that a child or patient will suffer from SBBYS they are able to diagnose the individual through genetic testing. SBBYS has no cure and is hard to treat because of how hard it is to diagnose. SBBYS occurs in les than 1 in a million kids."

    "Disease": "ZAP70 deficiency",
    "Causes": "ZAP70 deficiency SCID is caused by a mutation is the ZAP70 gene, which is involved in the development of T cells.[3]",
    "Diagnosis": "It is characterized by a lack of CD8+ T cells and the presence of circulating CD4+ T cells which are unresponsive to T-cell receptor (TCR)-mediated stimuli.[4]\nDiagnosis is usually made within the first six months of life. Genetic testing is required.[3]",
    "Treatment": "Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only known cure for ZAP70 deficient SCID.[5]",
    "Epidemiology": "ZAP70 deficiency SCID is estimated to occur in approximately 1 in 50,000 people. Fewer than fifty people with this condition have been identified.[3]"

    "Disease": "Zellweger spectrum disorders",
    "Signs and symptoms": "The symptoms of the disorders can vary from every patient. Most symptoms are noticeable at birth. There is often lack in growth and muscle tone as the child develops. Also the disorders involve neurological problems. This would include frequent seizures, delays in intellectual development, and the absence in basic reflexes.[citation needed]\nFacial abnormalities are also often common with patients. Including a small chin, upturned nostrils, and a mouth with a highly arched roof. There are also a variety of eye abnormalities that could happen. The eye abnormalities including clouding of the cataracts and retinopathy, which can lead to vision loss. Children with Zellweger Spectrum disorder can have hearing loss with onset during the first months following birth.[4]\nInfants with the disorder can also have abnormalities including their organs. They might have a large spleen or liver, as well as heart defects. Including holes in the heart, and high blood pressure. Due to the lack of muscle tone, infants can face respiratory problems as the disease progresses.[citation needed]",
    "Causes": "Zellweger spectrum disorders are a group of autosomal recessive genetic disorders. They are caused due to pathogenic mutations in at least 13 different PEX genes that encode peroxins.[5] It affects the peroxisomes, which are organelles in the body that are meant to breakdown items like acids and toxic compounds. Both parents will have to have the recessive gene for the child to show symptoms. If one parent has the gene and the other one does not, the child will be a carrier and will not show symptoms. Any mutation involving the genes that create or work the peroxisomes can lead to the development of any of the Zellweger Spectrum Disorders. Both genders have an equal chance to end up with these disorders.[citation needed]",
    "Diagnosis": "Definite diagnosis requires evaluation of peroxisomal functions.[5] Mutation analysis is done from fibroblast cell lines.[6]",
    "Treatment": "Treatment may involve a team of specialists. This would include neurologists, endocrinologists, and pediatricians.[citation needed]\nEarly intervention is important when treating someone with these disorders. Special education, physical therapy, and other medical services to aid the child through treatment. There are medical trials taking place to learn more about these disorders. Most infants that are diagnosed do not live past 6 months. It can be diagnosed by a blood test looking for PEX genes in the body.[clarification needed][7]",
    "Epidemiology": "It occurs in 1 in 50,000 individuals.[8]"

    "Disease": "Zollinger%E2%80%93Ellison syndrome",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Patients with Zollinger–Ellison syndrome may experience abdominal pain and diarrhea.[2] If left untreated, the condition could result in severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and refractory peptic ulcer disease.[5] The diagnosis is also suspected in patients who have severe and recurrent[6] ulceration of the stomach and small bowel, especially if they fail to respond to treatment.[7]\nGastrinomas may occur as single tumors or as multiple small tumors. About one-half to two-thirds of single gastrinomas are malignant tumors that most commonly spread to the liver and to lymph nodes near the pancreas and small bowel.[8]\nNearly 25 percent of patients with gastrinomas have multiple tumors as part of a condition called multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1). MEN I patients have tumors in their pituitary gland and parathyroid glands, in addition to tumors of the pancreas.[9]",
    "Diagnosis": "Zollinger–Ellison syndrome may be suspected when the above symptoms prove resistant to treatment when the symptoms are especially suggestive of the syndrome, or when endoscopy is suggestive. The diagnosis is made through several laboratory tests and imaging studies:[13]\nIn addition, the source of the increased gastrin production must be determined using MRI or somatostatin receptor scintigraphy.[18]\nDiagnosis can sometimes be very difficult, especially considering patients who take a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) medication for gastric reflux, which constitute a large and increasing proportion of people who develop Zollinger–Ellison syndrome. PPIs inadvertently increase gastrin production, which may cause a false positive for elevated gastrin levels. This can occur even in patients who have been off their medication for weeks, due to the long duration of effects of these medications.[6]",
    "Treatment": "Proton pump inhibitors (such as omeprazole and lansoprazole) and histamine H2-receptor antagonists (such as famotidine and ranitidine) are used to slow acid secretion. Once gastric acid is suppressed, symptoms normally improve. Surgery to remove peptic ulcers or tumors might also be considered.[19]",
    "Epidemiology": "The condition most commonly affects people between the ages of 30 and 60.[20] The prevalence is unknown, but estimated to be about 1 in 100,000 people.[21]"
